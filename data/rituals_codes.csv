Ritual1,Vow,"The Vow.
The most important functionary in the Blackfoot sun dance is a woman, known among the whites as the medicine woman, and upon a clear comprehension of her functions and antecedents depends our understanding of the ceremony itself. Accordingly, we shall proceed with as complete an exposition of her office as the information at hand allows. In the first place, a sun dance cannot occur unless some woman qualifies for the office. On the other hand, it was almost inconceivable that there should be a summer in which such a qualification would not be made. This attitude of our informants implies that public opinion had sufficient force to call out volunteers against their own wills. There was a feeling that an annual sun dance was, from a religious and ethical point of view, necessary to the general welfare, for which some individual ought to sacrifice personal comfort and property to the extent required by custom. As we shall see later, this was no small price to pay for a doubtful honor. This feeling was sure to express itself in the subtle ways peculiar to Indian society, if need be, to the direct suggestion of a candidate who in turn felt impelled to come forward as if prompted entirely from within.

As a rule, however, the woman qualifies by a vow. Oftimes, when a member of the family is dangerously ill, one of the women goes out of the tipi and raising her eyes to the sun calls upon it that health may be restored to the ailing one. In such an appeal she offers to make gifts to the sun, usually specifying that she will sacrifice a piece of cloth, a dress, a robe, an ax, etc., which are after a time, provided the sick one improves, hung in trees or deposited upon a hill. Such appeals are still made with great frequency. It is believed that unless the woman has been industrious, truthful, and above all, true to her marriage vows, her appeal will not be answered. Sometimes, when the woman addresses the sun she promises to be the medicine woman at the next sun dance. She herself may be ill and promise such a sacrifice in case she receives help. Again, she may, out of gratitude for the satisfactory way in which her prayers have been answered, announce her intention to take this step. In such a case, a formal announcement is made to the sun. In company with a man, usually a medicineman experienced in the ceremonies, she steps out into the camp, where they face the sun whom the man addresses, explaining that as this woman asked for help in time of need and that inasmuch as it was granted, she in turn promises to be the medicine woman at the first opportunity. Some such formal announcement is made in every case where the prayers have been answered. By this formality, the vow receives public registry.

As indicated above, the prayers are not always granted. In such cases, the promises are not only not binding, but to proceed with the sun dance, or to take a secondary part in it, would be to the detriment of all concerned. The fault is said to lie in the woman’s life and that only the wrath of the sun would be invoked by her participation in the ceremonies.

It may be asked if a man can make such a vow. He may and does often call upon the sun, promising gifts of property or even scalps and may promise to furnish the material support for a wife, mother, sister, or in fact any woman who will come forward to perform the ceremony. Thus, a Blood chief once told us that he had been very ill all winter; that he had tried all kinds of doctors without relief, until he was stripped of all his property. At last, he recovered and then made a vow that with the help of his wife he would give the sun dance. This he did, but, as he expressed it, “with great difficulty because he was then poor and did not receive adequate help from his relatives.”

Again, it must be noted that women who do not feel equal to the responsibility of the medicine woman’s office, make a vow to announce publicly their virginity or faithfulness to their marriage vows, as the case may be, though for an unmarried woman to make such a pledge is the exception. This is spoken of as “the going forward to the tongues,” the full meaning of which will appear later. The manner and occasion of making this vow are in most respects similar to the preceding. At a certain stage of the sun dance proceedings, all the women who made such a promise to the sun, come forward and make their statements subject to the challenge of any man present. This bears some resemblance to the virginity tests of the Dakota, but applies more particularly to married women and marital virtue than otherwise.

Naturally, the number of women making promises of this kind was much greater than for the more important ceremony. Thus, we have a custom of calling upon the sun in time of need which is an almost universal practice, a more restricted form of such appeal peculiar to women in so far that sexual morality is a necessary qualification, the more specific vow of “going forward to the tongues”, and the exceptional vow to perform the medicine woman’s functions at the sun dance, a fair illustration of the way in which most complex folk ceremonies are supported by a pyramid of less and less differentiated practices.

In passing, it should be noted that when the vow is made to perform the medicine woman’s functions, it is literally an obligation to purchase a natoas bundle, or if already the owner of a bundle, to perform its ritual. A woman may own more than one of these bundles at a time; indeed, we have heard of a woman purchasing new ones at several, successive sun dances. This purchase is a fundamental feature in all bundle ceremonies to which the sun dance bundle offers no exception.

On the other hand, the vow means more than the mere purchase of a bundle. We are told that the requirement as to virtue holds strictly for the vow and the tongue ceremony. A woman can buy a natoas in the ordinary sense and have it transferred with the ritual even though she has not been true to her husband. We are reminded that Scabby-round-robe’s wife was not true to her former husband and that when her husband received a beaver bundle there went with it a natoas and accessories; but that while she could use them by virtue of her relation to a beaver bundle, she was not competent to make a vow and initiate a sun dance. This is consistent with the tradition that the natoas was once bought from a beaver bundle by a woman who gave the sun dance for that year and used instead of a wreath of juniper as in former ceremonies. It also throws some light on the relation of the natoas to the beaver and the sun dance rituals.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Ritual2,Ceremony of the tongues,"Ceremony of the Tongues.

While it is obvious from the preceding, that the medicine woman takes her vow at no fixed period in the year, the order of procedure is such that as a rule, she must have taken her vow not later than the spring of the year in which the sun dance occurs. There is no absolute prohibition to qualifying at a later time, as is often the case at present when the consent of the Indian Agent must be obtained before the ceremony is permitted, but the normal order seems to be as just stated. Any way, in the spring, the medicine woman calls upon her relatives for buffalo tongues (in recent years, those of cattle). These are then saved as requested. In passing, it may be noted that in all ceremonies, the persons upon whom the burden of responsibility falls have not only an inherent right to call upon their blood relatives, but these in turn are under obligations to respond. The number of tongues required is uncertain, some informants claiming that there should be an even hundred, others, that four to five full parfleches was the standard. Naturally, in recent years, the number has been much less. These tongues are to be sliced, parboiled, and dried like meat. The slices, however, must be perfect, without holes, and come from the interior of the tongue.

The slicing of these tongues appears to have been the first ceremony of the cycle. It is conducted by a man, usually the father, who formally announced the woman’s vow and who conducts all the ceremonies in which the medicine woman takes part. There is no stipulation that the same man must direct all parts of the ceremony, but, by custom, this office is performed annually by the same man so long as he is physically capable. To this ceremony are called the medicine woman, the women who have promised to “go forward to take the tongues”, and sometimes those having previously performed these functions.

The manner of formally registering the vow and of collecting the tongues is stated as follows:—

Now the woman who made the vow calls on a man and woman who have been through the medicine lodge ceremony to announce it. The man and woman come to her tipi and paint her clothes and face and those of the relative for whom the vow was made with red paint. Prayers are offered for them and a few songs sung. After this, the four stand in front of the tipi and the man announces the vow. He says, “Sun, she is going to make a sun lodge for you. I think you and those who are above can hear what is said.” Then they move in turn to the south, west, and north side of the tipi, repeating the same words at each stop and finally enter the tipi.

In the spring of the year, when the people run buffalo, the woman has her tipi a little towards the front or center. It may be that she is only with one of the bands, while the rest are camped elsewhere. Her tipi stands alone a little to the west of the others. The people are then notified that the tongues are to be given to the woman. Her husband mounts his horse and sets out, taking a pipe and tobacco, but no weapons with him. When he finds a man butchering, he sits down on a robe, fills his pipe, prays for those present, and smokes with them. The butcher cuts out the tongue, wipes it off with sagegrass, and places it near the man, who has spread some buffalo dung with sagegrass on top of it in a row before him. The tongues are placed on the sage and dung. The man then takes the tongues and rides to where the next man is butchering and goes through the same procedure. After he has gathered up all the tongues he takes them home. Each time buffalo are killed the man rides out to gather in tongues until he has accumulated a hundred.

The tongues having been collected, an important ceremony follows with their boiling and slicing. An experienced man and woman are invited to direct; these are spoken of as the father and the mother. Also, all the women having made a vow “to go forward to the tongues” are invited. In addition, a number of women and men familiar with the ceremonies are called. The woman making the vow (the daughter) and her husband (the son) sit at the back of the fire; next to the former, sits the mother and then the other women; next to the latter, sits the father and then the men in order. The men sit on the north side and the women on the south. At the proper moment, the mother brings in the tongues, passing around to the south side, and lays them in rows on a half rawhide back of the fire. All the women having made vows are now called upon to slice the tongues. Their husbands must be present.

The tongues are slit open and the women are invited to slice and boil them. When all the guests are present, one of the tongues is taken and painted black on one edge and red on the other, and given to the woman who made the vow. The rest of the tongues are handed to the women for skinning and slicing; if there were more tongues than women, each was given more than one to slice. After all the women have the tongues, the woman with the painted tongue makes a confession, saying, “Sun, I have been true to my husband ever since I have been with him and all my life. Help me, for what I say is true. I will skin this tongue without cutting a hole in it or cutting my fingers.”

The next woman also makes a confession, and so on. After all have confessed, they commence to skin the tongues. As the first woman takes up the knife, the song runs: “A sharp thing I have taken; it is powerful.” The knife is painted, one half red, the other black. Should any of the women cut a hole in the tongue skin or cut their fingers, it is a sign that they must have lied and they are ordered from the tipi. At the outset, each woman carefully examines her tongue to see if the skin is perfect. Should a hole be found, the tongue is passed to the director who marks it with black paint. After the tongues are all skinned and sliced, they are passed back to the woman who distributed them and placed in a wooden bowl. The skins of the tongues are tied in bunches with sinew so that they can tell to which woman the skins belong.

The skins are to be boiled by two women. Two sticks are given to one woman and one to the other. All this time singing is going on. The woman who has the two sticks paints them black, while the woman who has the other, paints it red. The three sticks are tied together at one end and are used as a tripod for hanging the kettle in which the skins of the tongues are to be boiled. The legs of the tripod, the wooden kettle hook, and all other sticks are painted half in red and half in black. Also, the kettle is marked with four vertical bands of black and four of red. The four blunt sticks for stirring the pot are painted in pairs, red and black. A red and black painted stick is slipped through the bail, passed around to the north of the tipi, and handed to the two women. During all these movements there is praying and singing. The women each take hold of one end of the stick and go for water.

They make four pauses on this journey, each time praying to the sun and asserting their marital rectitude and recounting such occasions as they have been improperly approached by a man. All this time, the father and his assistants sing in the tipi. One of the women takes a cup, makes four movements with it and dips the water. At this moment the song runs:—

“The water that I see.
Water is sacred.”

On the return, the women make four pauses as before. When the pail is finally within the tipi, incense is burned between the fireplace and the door and the pail held in the smudge. The father takes up the board upon which some of the tongues lie and while holding it up in one hand, shakes the cup about in the water, meanwhile making a noise like the buffalo, finally striking the pail a blow with the cup. Here the song runs:—

“Buffalo will drink.”

This may be taken as marking one stage of the ceremony. The boiling of the tongue is now in order. When all is ready, the father starts the songs in the next series. The two women hook the kettle on the tripods and while the kettle is heated, there are other songs and incense burned and the song runs:—

“Where I (buffalo speaking) sit is sacred.”

While the water boils, the director takes up a tongue, holds it above the kettle, lowers it slowly, making a noise as if something were drinking. After this, the women place the tongues in the kettle and proceed with the boiling. Here or elsewhere, songs accompany the ceremonial acts. The pot must not boil over.

While the water boils, the director takes up a tongue, holds it above the kettle, lowers it slowly, making a noise as if something were drinking. After this, the women place the tongues in the kettle and proceed with the boiling. Here or elsewhere, songs accompany the ceremonial acts. The pot must not boil over.

“Old Man (sun), he wants pemmican.
He wants to eat.
Old Woman (moon), she wants back fat.
She wants to eat.
Morningstar, he wants broth.
He wants to eat.”

Then the painted tongue is passed to the daughter. Now, each of the women tears off a bit of the tongue skin and all hold up the pieces and pray. After the prayers, the pieces are placed in the earth and the tongues are hung up to dry. First, the rope is taken up and a song sung. The woman who made the vow, rises and ties one end of the rope to the tipi pole on the north side and the other end to the tipi pole on the south side, a little to the west of the fireplace. All the tongues, both painted and unpainted, are hung on this rope.

During all these ceremonies there is no regular smudge. The smudges are made with sweetgrass on the grass near the rear of the tipi. The tongues are left to hang for two days before they are taken down to be cooked. When the tongues have been hung, all return to their homes, the women taking the tongue skins with them for their relatives to eat, as they are considered to be blessed and supposed to bring good luck.

After two days, all meet again in the same tipi. The two women who went for the water place the tripods over the fire and while songs are sung, the pot is passed to them with the red painted sticks. The two women, each holding one end of the stick, go for water, praying on the way. When they return to the tipi a smudge, over which they hold the bucket of water, is made between the door and the fireplace. Then the bucket is placed beside the smudge. While the others sing, the woman who made the vow rises and first takes the painted tongue and then the others from where they were hung. They are then placed on a buffalo hide and the woman returns to her place. Four women sit down near the tongues; each one takes a tongue, one of which is the painted one. Kneeling and swaying their bodies in time with the songs, they sing the buffalo songs. The painted tongue is placed in the kettle first and a song is sung: “When buffalo go to drink; it is powerful. Where buffalo sit is powerful (natojiwa).” Then the rest of the tongues are placed in the pot which is hooked on the tripod over the fire. Songs are sung and four sticks, about the length of the forearm, for stirring the tongues, are placed where the tongues were first placed. One of the cooks takes a pair of the sticks and stirs the tongues with them. When removing the tongues from the kettle they are held between two of these sticks.

Another song, called the song of rest is sung, and all rest for a time and smoke. When the tongues are cooled, another song is sung, the two cooks rise, and taking the pot, place it over the smudge place near the door. To the singing of songs, the painted tongue first, and then the others, are taken out and placed on half a rawhide. The soup is poured into wooden bowls and distributed among those present. No tin cups must be used in drinking this soup. While all sing, the woman who made the vow rises and first takes the painted tongue and then all the others and hangs them up as before. This ends the ceremony.

Two days later, the same participants are called together to the same tipi and the woman rises and takes first the painted tongue and then the others from where they were hung. A parfleche is brought and a buffalo song sung: “Buffalo I take. Where I sit is powerful.” The painted tongue and then the others are placed on the parfleche. Wild peppermint is put in with the tongues, the parfleches are tied up and placed at the rear of the tipi. Sometimes tongues are dried in front of the tipi on a stage made by setting up two travois with a lodge pole tied between them.

The man and woman who lead the ceremony must not have any metal about them. Brass rings, earrings, and all such trinkets must be taken off. Nor must there be any knives in the vicinity. Even the knives with which the tongues are cut are taken out. No one must spit in front of him, but always close to the wall under the beds. If they do, it will rain. No water is brought into the medicine lodge and when water is brought, it is covered. The only time when it is permitted to eat or drink is before sunrise and after sunset. They must be given food by the instructors. The prayers in this ceremony are prayers for good luck for everyone in the camp.

This closes the preliminaries to the ceremonies leading to the sun dance and may be designated as the cutting of the tongues. As in most other cases, there seems to have been considerable variation in this procedure, both as to time and order. Certainly, for a number of years, it has been much abbreviated. As implied in the program, this ceremony may be performed on the first day. The gathering of tongues was dependent upon circumstances and after the days of the great buffalo drives was a matter of gradual accumulation. Thus, it was explained, that by necessity, the “cutting” was often repeated, though naturally with less ceremony.

The parfleches containing tongues are kept in the medicine woman’s tipi where they are “prayed and sung over” during the first and second days of the program. The underlying thought seems to be that they are consecrated to the sun.

In the procession of the fourth day, the parfleches are carried behind the medicine woman by her attendants. In former years, these were the women who had promised “to go forward to the tongues.” They are present at the ceremony in the medicine woman’s tipi and may be said to be in attendance during the entire fasting period. At the time indicated in the program, the parfleches are opened and the women in turn step out with some of the dried tongue, face the west, and each holding up a piece, address the sun then nearing the horizon. They declare their innocence of adultery, as at the time of making the vow and cutting the tongues. They also pray for themselves and their relatives after which they distribute dried tongue among them. Finally, there is a general distribution of tongues among the people.

However, there is another aspect of their appearance at this point. The Blackfoot assume that many women have at one or more periods of their lives been invited by a man to commit the offence and that often the occasion is one of great temptation or calls for great presence of mind and will power. Now, when addressing the sun, if so approached, the woman narrates the circumstances, naming the men committing the offence, and recounts the manner of her refusal. In naming the offender, they usually say, “I suppose he hears what I say.” These women are also subject to challenge of their having committed adultery. It will be seen from this that the part they take in the ceremony is an ordeal for which most women have little liking and one which they will not undertake lightly. The Blackfoot, themselves, regard it as one of the most solemn occasions in the ceremony. So far as we could learn, no one now living was ever present when one of these women was challenged, but the naming of men who were guilty of improper advances was not unusual.

A retrospect of the concept of the tongues indicates that the entire ceremony, or their association with the medicine woman and those who are sexually pure, gives them a potency that may be acquired by eating. They seem most closely associated with sexual purity since they are less primary in the function of the medicine woman than in case of those who “go forward,” the former being required to possess many virtues, the latter but one. While the medicine woman fasts and keeps to her tipi, the others do not.",1,1,1,1,0,1
Ritual3,Hundred willow sweat house,"The Hundred—Willow Sweathouse.

As stated before, a sweathouse of special form is constructed on the third day. This is said to have originated with Scar-face, it being the house into which he was taken by the sun. About the middle of the day a society is sent out for the willows. These were usually those of the younger men; the pigeons and mosquitoes. There is a belief, however, that in former times only warriors could be sent upon this errand. These persons are mounted and return in procession, singing and circling the medicine woman’s tipi in the direction of the sun, and deposit their willows at the west side of the camp circle. They must not drink water while on this duty.

An older society is called to build the sweathouse. They must not drink water while engaged in this operation and receive some of the tongues after the ceremonies of the fourth day. Formerly, these men must have had a coup to their credit as a qualification and some informants claim that the sum total for the society should have totalled at least one hundred, the number of willows. The work begins some time before sunset by which time the sweathouse should be completed.

The willows are stuck into the ground in an oval and their tops bent over and interlocked over the top. The ends point toward the east and the west, an opening or door being provided at each. The willows are then painted, one side red and the other black. Next, a hole is dug in the center of the structure for the heated stones. In the meantime, a small heap of stònes mixed with firewood has been placed some distance to the east. A buffalo skull is painted with red spots on one side and black on the other. Sagegrass is thrust into the nose and eye-sockets. Robes are then thrown over the willows and all is ready for the procession from the medicine woman’s tipi.

The procession from the medicine woman’s tipi consists of the father and another man experienced in ceremonial affairs, the husband, the mother and the medicine woman. They approach slowly and by stages, passing around the south side of the sweathouse to the north and then to the east or entrance. All keep their eyes on the ground. The husband walks with a heavy staff; the medicine woman carries the natoas bundle with a smudge stick.

The men enter the sweathouse, while the two women go to the west side and sit down facing the east. The medicine woman is on the north side with the bundle before her. After the men have entered, the fire is lighted and some of the attendants (builders of the sweathouse) lift the buffalo skull to the top of the sweathouse where it faces the east. Prayers and the usual sweathouse procedure now follow while the stones and a pail of water are passed in by an attendant. The covers are then drawn down and the vapor bath taken.

After the ceremony the procession returns to the medicine woman’s tipi. The cover is removed from the sweathouse and the buffalo skull placed on top where it remains.

Should there be more than one medicine woman, another sweathouse is made on the east side of the camp circle and the others grouped around them equally.

Since after the sweathouse ceremony there is formal singing in the tipi until far into the night, it may be said that during the four days of the fast the ceremonies begin with the sweathouse at sundown, while on the fifth day the ceremony begins in the morning and ends at sundown.

To this generalized statement the following account from a Piegan may be added:—

Now, when the first sweathouse is to be made, orders are given in the morning to one of the societies to get the willows to make the hundred-willow sweathouse. Another man is to get the creeping juniper to use in the smudge place in the medicine lodge, and still another is to cut out the smudge place. The moves are short. The people all move camp, as before, and the society goes on ahead and stakes out the camping ground. When the tipis are pitched at the new camping ground, the society comes in with the willows and the rocks for the sweathouse. They circle once around to the right of the lodges and stop outside of the circle, west of the medicine lodge. They must neither eat nor drink while building the sweathouse. They gather wood from among the tipis until they have enough to heat the rocks. Robes for covering the sweathouse are borrowed from the people of the camp. One man goes to the medicine lodge and digs out the smudge place.

When the sweathouse is ready for the medicinemen, four of the men who helped in the construction go and inform the men and women. They carry the parfleche with the tongues in it on a robe, each man holding a corner. The two medicinemen take the lead, the two women follow, then come the four men with the parfleche. Four stops are made before they reach the sweathouse. The instructor leads, and is followed in single file by the other man, and the two women walking very slowly and singing. They march once around the sweathouse in the direction of the sun. The other old men who are to join them and the two medicinemen go in while the two women remain seated on a robe just west of it with the parfleche beside them. A smudge is made with sweetgrass, and a crescent-shaped place marked out between the square hole and the rear of the sweathouse and live coals are placed on the dot in front of the crescent. A song is sung while the smudge stick is taken up and a man goes after the coal for the smudge. The sweatgrass is placed on the live coal and the two songs for the smudge are sung: “Spring grass I take. Where I sit is powerful.” A pipe is handed in and the pipe bowl and stem painted red. The man holds the pipe over the smudge and prays for the one who gave it to him and then passes it to the last man to his right who lights it and all smoke it. When the pipe is all burnt out, the man who blessed it, takes it, and with a red-painted stick loosens the ashes and empties some of them on the southeast corner of the square hole in the sweathouse, then on the northwest corner, on the northeast, and finally in the center.

After this the buffalo skull is brought in and the songs of the buffalo sung while the same man paints it with black and red dots, the left half black and the right half in red. Grass is stuffed into the eyes and nose of the skull which is passed out through the west of the sweathouse and placed on the earth taken out of the hole in the sweathouse. An extra buffalo horn wrapped with swamp grass is brought in and given to the man who paints it red and sings while doing so: “Chiefs of other tribes I want to hook.” He throws the horn out and all the men of this society who remain near the sweathouse try to catch it. The one who captures it is considered lucky and he is supposed to capture a gun in the next battle he witnesses.

The men in the sweathouse all undress and as they pass their robes and moccasins out through the west of the sweathouse and the door, the buffalo songs are sung. The two medicinemen only wear a robe and moccasins when they go into the sweathouse. While singing, the forked stick is taken up and one of the outsiders goes for the heated stones, stopping four times before he brings them in. One of the men who is inside takes the stone with two straight sticks and places it on the south-east corner of the hole, the same is done with four more stones which are placed on the southwest, the northwest, the northeast corner and the fifth is placed in the bottom of the hole at the center. When a sixth stone is placed in the hole, they are all rolled to the bottom of the hole. Water and a horn spoon or wooden bowl is brought in.

A little water is thrown on the stones to wash them, the curtains are lowered, and prayers to the sun, moon, and stars, and earth begin. In groups of four, sixteen medicine lodge songs are sung. The curtains are raised and four more songs are sung; the sweathouse is opened and four songs are sung, until the sixteen have been completed. The two medicinemen go out through the west of the sweathouse while the rest go through the door. The men dress, and the parfleche containing the tongues is opened and the tongues given to the members of the society who made the sweathouse. The medicinemen and women do not eat. After all are provided with the tongues a piece is broken off each and while all hold the pieces up a prayer is said and the piece of tongue placed on the ground. Then they all begin to eat. After this the robes are all returned to their owners, the buffalo skull placed on top of the frame of the sweathouse with the nose pointed towards the east and the medicinemen and women return in single file while four men follow behind carrying the empty parfleche. The men who belong to the society may now eat and drink as they wish.",1,0,1,1,1,1

Ritual5,Cutting of sun pole,"The Dancing Lodge.

The dancing lodge may be said to take its origin on the fourth day, by which time the medicine woman has her tipi in place near its site and the camp circle has been formed. In construction, nine forked tree trunks about nine feet in height are set in a circle. Across their tops, except the eastern face, are laid stringers about fifteen feet long of the same material. In the center, is another forked tree trunk much higher than the other (this we shall call the sun pole) connected with each of the stringers by a rafter. Green boughs are placed thickly against the outside of the lodge. On the inside, at the rear, is a booth screened and roofed with boughs. The material is cottonwood. That other woods were occasionally used, is attested by the fact that a locality is known as “the place of sweet pine dancing lodge.”

Some informants claim that in former years each band was required to furnish two rafters, a post, a rail, and their proportionate amount of boughs. Two rafters were used instead of one as now, each band furnishing the section opposite their place in the circle. The contradiction between the number of bands and the size of the dancing lodge seems not to have troubled our informants. Now, the young men go out during the early part of the fourth day to cut the poles and boughs. This is done without ceremony. A crier usually rides around the camp circle reminding the various bands of their duty. Formerly, the young women went out on horseback to drag in the poles and brush. On this occasion, they dressed in the best costumes and used the finest horse trappings obtainable. The men cut the poles and brush, hitching them to the drag ropes with their own hands. As the procession galloped toward the camp circle, the men rode behind, shooting and yelling. In recent years, the men bring the material in on wagons without demonstration.

Men of some prominence are selected to dig the holes for the posts. The posts are erected and the stringers put in place, excepting one on the west side nearly opposite the entrance. The rafters are leaned against the stringers, ready to be pushed in place and the green boughs piled up at convenient places near by.

The cutting of the sun pole is attended with some ceremony. Some informants claim that formerly this was to be carried out by the medicine woman’s band; others that one of the men’s societies was called upon for this service. In any event, they go out as a war party and locate a suitable tree. A man with a war record, preferably one having struck an enemy with an ax, comes forward, takes an ax, paints the blade as he recounts some event in which he killed an enemy, and then strikes the tree. Four such deeds must be told before the tree can be felled. Then one or two men cut the tree as the others stand around. As the tree begins to fall all give the war cry and shoot at its top, then rush up, and tearing off branches, wave them in the air as if they were trophies from an enemy. Indeed, the whole proceeding, from start to finish, is a mimic attack on an enemy.

The pole is cut to approximate form and taken to the site of the dancing lodge. One end is placed on a travois (in recent times on a wagon), while the riders assist with their ropes, their horses massed around the travois horse.

The hole for the sun pole is dug without ceremony by relatives of the medicine woman. When it is in place, they tie a bundle of green boughs in the fork, making everything ready for the raising in the evening. The sun pole now lies on the ground with the butt over the hole and the forked end supported by a piece of timber. The fork points to the west. It seems that formerly the pole was painted. Just below the fork it was circled by two black bands and two red ones beneath these.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual6,raising sun pole,"Raising the Sun Pole.

While the hide is being cut, all the woman who made vows to take some of the tongues come forward to the parfleche placed near the medicinemen and women. Each woman takes one of the tongues and stands with the person for whom her vow was made and makes a confession to the sun in a loud voice, so all may hear. Then she prays to the sun for the beneficiary. After all the women have taken their tongues, some of the men tie the cloth offerings to the ends of the poles and a bunch of birch is tied between the forks of the center pole.

The preceding ceremony comes to a close as the sun gets very low. About time for the sun to set, a procession of pole raisers starts from each of the four quarters of the camp circle. Tipi poles are tied near the small ends in pairs, each pair carried by two men. The four parties advance in unison by four stages and at each pause sing a special song. In the last move, they rush upon the sun pole and raise it in place. In the meantime, the father and son go and stand on the center pole while their wives stand to the west. The men make wing movements with their arms toward the east. According to some informants, the medicine woman may make hooking motions at the pole, to symbolize the mythical Elk-woman.

Four men are called upon to assist the father and son. As the latter stand upon the pole, they encircle and screen them with their blankets and join the father in singing. The songs call for good luck in erecting the dancing lodge. The son does not sing. Four songs are sung. At the end of each the father blows a whistle while someone shakes the pole. The last time they jump off the pole. The son drops his blanket (some say the father also, some add moccasins) painted black as a sun offering. Another blanket is handed him at once.

As soon as the men leave the pole the advancing raisers rush in, raise the center pole, put on the rafters, tie them with the rawhide strands and place brush all around to form the wind-break. This is accompanied by much shouting, but without shooting.

While the sun pole is being raised the daughter and mother stand watching it. They pray and make movements with the corners of their robes as though steering the rising pole. As it sways from side to side, they gesture as if righting it.

As soon as the pole is set, the natoas, robe, and moccasins are taken off the daughter by the mother. She may call on someone to do this and pay a gun or a horse for the service. The mother and other attendants then lead the daughter to her tipi where she resumes her ordinary routine.

The father and son go to a sweathouse where all the paint is washed off. This is not the hundred-willow sweathouse and is the fifth sweathouse, if it were counted. The two men go in and some sagegrass being handed to the father, he takes off the feathers tied to the son’s hair, the hair necklace, and whistle. After the first opening of the sweathouse he takes the sagegrass and wipes off the black paint on the son and hands out through the west side of the sweathouse the necklace, whistle, and feathers which are to be taken home. At the same time, the two women are in the ceremonial lodge, the mother caring for the daughter.

When the men have completed the sweathouse ceremony they go to the medicine woman’s tipi. The father and his wife wrap up the natoas and place it in the badger skin. After this is done, they no longer have to eat sparingly. This ends the ceremony of the medicine woman.

Early the next day she and her husband must obtain the cottonwood brush with which the booth for the weather dancers is made. Another man digs out the place in the booth, making it the same as the smudge place in the medicine woman’s tipi, with the sod on three sides and creeping juniper on top of it. The fireplace is dug out to the west of the center post and is made as in the medicine woman’s tipi. When going for and returning the brush, the woman rides one horse and leads the one dragging her travois. While when the other brush was brought in there was much shooting and shouting, there are now no demonstrations of any kind, but absolute silence.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Ritual7,weather dance,"The Weather Dancers.

Early on the fifth day, a booth is built inside the dancing lodge opposite the entrance. A slight excavation about six feet square is made over which is erected a shelter of green cottonwood boughs, open on the side facing the sun pole. Before the middle of the day, a procession of one or more men supposed to have power over the weather, attended by drummers, proceeds by stages from the medicine woman’s tipi to this booth. They pause four times and dance, facing alternately the east and the west. They hold whistles of bone in their mouths, which are sounded in unison with the dancing. The procession is of two transverse lines, the dancers, in front, the drummers and singers behind. A great deal of dancing is done between the entrance to the dancing lodge and the booth. At intervals during the day they stand before the booth and dance to the east and west: the drummers are now stationed on the south side of the booth where women also assemble for the singing. The dancing is chiefly an up and down movement produced by flexing the knees, the eyes are directed toward the sun and wing-like movements of the hands are made in the same direction. The dancers wear breechcloth and moccasins and usually a robe around the waist. Their faces and bodies are painted according to their own medicines and medicine objects worn on their heads.

It is stated that there is but one weather dancer, but others may join under certain conditions. In practice this seems to amount to there being a director or leader in the dance, at least such was the case in 1903 and 1904. In 1904 the two assistant dancers went to the medicine woman’s tipi to paint themselves and began their procession from there, while the leader approached in a similar manner from his own tipi, the two forming one procession before the east side of the dancing lodge was reached. The leading dancer wore a special ceremonial robe, headdress, and several medicine objects, which have been described in Volume 7 (pp. 98—99).

These objects and their medicine functions may be regarded as esoteric in so far as they are not absolutely essential to the office of leading dancer. Yet, this same individual seems to have performed this function for a number of years. Clark mentions strings of feathers tied to the finger of this dancer.

In 1904 there were two assistant dancers. Both wore headdresses somewhat like that of their leader. One was fully dressed with a blanket around his waist; the other was nude to the belt. The latter was painted chiefly in red with a circle in blue on the back and one on the breast. The former had a pair of horizontal lines on each cheek, those on the right, black, on the left, red.

It is said that formerly these dancers were nude, except for the breechcloth and moccasins. The entire body was painted. There seemed to have been no fixed painting, but the sun, moon, and stars were usually represented. Around the head, they wore a wreath of juniper and bands of sagegrass around the neck, wrists, and ankles.

The weather dancers are not permitted to eat or drink during the day. Formerly, they remained in the booth continuously until the evening of the fourth day of their dancing; in recent years, they spend the night at home and return to the booth in the morning.

The functions of these dancers are not clearly understood. They seem to be held responsible for the weather: i. e., upon them falls the duty of preventing rain from interfering with the dancing. Whether they do this because they happen to have independent shamanistic powers or whether it is a mere function of their temporary office in the ceremony, cannot be determined. Other medicinemen often attempt to control the weather during the days preceding the formal entry into the booth as well as during the later days. In 1903 (Piegan) there was a contest between a number of rival medicinemen some of whom conjured for rain, others for fair weather: strange to say, clouds would threaten and then pass away during these days, which coincidence was interpreted as proof of evenly matched powers. Several times one of the partisans of fair weather came out near the site of the dancing lodge and danced to the sun, holding up a small pipe and occasionally shouting. He wore no regalia and danced in a different manner from that observed among the weather dancers at the booth. However, the man who led the weather dancers for many years until his death in 1908, was famous for his control over the weather. Once, it is told, he became enraged at the power making the weather bad, shouting out “Now, you go ahead, if you want to. I have great power and can stop you when I will.”

In former times, the dreams of the weather dancers while sleeping in the booth were considered of special supernatural significance, since, it is said, they were [illegible] rapport with the sun. This rapport may account for what seems to be one of their chief functions—blessing the people. During the days they are in the booth, individuals come to them “to be prayed for.” They come up and stand before the booth. The dancer takes black paint and paints their faces. Then he prays to the sun for their welfare. During this part of the ceremony the recipient faces the sun. Again, the medicine-pipes and other ritualistic objects are brought up for the dancer to present to the sun. The pipes he holds up with the stems towards the sun, whom he addresses at some length, offering him a smoke, making requests, etc., after which he smokes the pipe. All the persons present are then permitted to put their lips to the pipe from which they are supposed to derive great benefits. The dancer also receives offerings made to the sun. A young man may fill a pipe and approach with his offerings. The dancer takes the pipe, smokes, prays, paints the man’s face, and makes the offering. A woman or child may do this; or a whole family. Formerly, a great deal of old clothing was offered at this time, a custom still practised by the Blood. Also children’s moccasins and clothing were offered in this way. As they grew out of them they were given to the sun to promote well-being. In last analysis, it seems that while these dancers are spoken of as weather priests, they are rather sun priests, since through them appeals to the sun are made. It should be noted that they are regarded as independent of and in no way associated with the medicine woman ceremonies or the erection of the dancing lodge, but upon entrance to the booth, the leading weather dancer is said to become the chief and director of all succeeding ceremonies. The length of the ceremony depends entirely upon him and formerly continued as long as he kept his place.

Like other rites this one was bought and sold, but it was usual to continue in ownership many years. Anyone could make a vow to dance with the weather dancer and join him in his ceremonies, but such vows were usually made by former owners of the rite. When one makes a vow to purchase the rite, its owner must sell, however reluctant he may be. The transfer must be in the sun dance. It is said that two men once alternately sold to each other for many years so that both could appear in every sun dance.",1,0,0,0,1,0

Ritual9,making of a brave? (assumed),"One ancient custom, the “making of a brave,” has been so misinterpreted and criticized that I feel it my duty to explain it more fully here.

In case of the severe illness of a close relative, an Indian would make a solemn vow, usually to the Sun, in the following words: “I will sacrifice my body to you, to be lacerated, at the next Sun Dance ceremonies, trusting my relative will recover from his illness.” A candidate for this ceremony would then purchase the right to carry out his vow from another Indian who had previously been through this terrible ordeal. This done, he was free to present himself at the next annual Sun Dance to be pierced.

Minus his attire, excepting his breech cloth and moccasins, his body was first plastered with white clay. A coronet of sage bush adorned his head; he also wore bracelets and anklets of the same bush. Thus attired, he paced up and down, like a caged animal, close to the centre pole of the Sun Dance lodge. He stretched his arms at intervals and sang in defiance of the torture soon to be undergone. At a given signal from attending warriors, he lay down on his back and was asked the following questions by one of the sages in attendance: “Do you wish to be pierced deeply or slightly?” If he says deeply, then he will be pierced lightly; if he says slightly, then he must suffer a deep penetration.

After this formality, an arrowhead, sharpened and greased to a razor‘s edge, was picked up by an old man, who held the muscle of one side of the candidate‘s breast out taut and pushed the arrow through it. Blood started trickling down the sides of the candidate. A small stick, sharpened at one end, was thrust through the wound and left in with both ends showing. Similar operations were performed on the opposite side. Next, he would turn over, and similar lacerations were made on his right shoulder blade and stick thrust through the wounds. Two rawhide thongs, fastened securely at one end to the top of the centrepole, were then tied fast to both of the inserted sticks at his breast, after he regained his feet. A shield was tied to the inserted stick at his right shoulder blade.

At this moment weird chanting and drumming began, accompanied by loud applause from a number of old women. This was done to arouse excitement. The candidate then started to dance with a backward pulling motion, keeping time with the drums, and at the same time pulling full weight on the thongs attached to the sticks inserted in his breast. At intervals while dancing, he would seize the shield fastened to his shoulder blade and do his utmost, tearing his flesh, to get it loose. It he was unable to release himself from the two thongs attached to his bosom, an incision was made into the muscles holding the sticks in place, and again he must dance, taking his weight, as before, on the rawhide thongs. If this fails to release him, a spectator would grasp him from behind his shoulder and pull down on the thongs. The added weight would tear the flesh with a sickening sound, releasing both sticks and sending both men to the ground. The flesh holding the stick and shield attached to his shoulder blade was ripped from him if he failed to tear them loose after repeated efforts. This was the custom which writers described as “the making of a brave” and which they erroneously say all male Indians must submit to in order to be placed in the category of the “brave.” But, as already stated, the only reason why an Indian subjected himself to this ordeal was to propitiate the Sun god for the recovery from illness of a very dear relative.

Eagle Ribs, a member of our tribe and later one of our counsellors, subjected himself to this ceremony three times in succession. A belief in dreams led Eagle Ribs to undergo this marvellous feat of endurance. One night a person appeared to him in a dream saying, “Sacrifice yourself to be pierced three days in succession at this Sun Dance if you would have your father recover.” Accordingly, the next day Eagle Ribs presented himself for this painful ordeal at the Sun Dance ceremonies, and thrice went through with this painful ritual.

Other Indians who sacrificed themselves in the years immediately before this custom was officially stopped were Heavy Head, Tough Bread and Sarcee Man, the latter being a Peigan Indian.

The practice of taking the scalp from a vanquished foe was done mainly for the purpose of proving the prowess of the victor. An incision was made around the top of the head and the skin pulled off with a quick jerk. The scalp was then kept as a souvenir; at war dances it was attached to a long stick and held high in the air by the owner while dancing.

Another custom which played a prominent part in the life of a warrior on the eve of battle was to cut away a small portion of his body as an offering to any of the numerous lesser spirits then worshipped by our people.

I witnessed a revival of this custom during the great war in Europe. One evening, during those dark days of 1917 when the Germans were having things pretty much their own way, I was walking along a French road with a number of other Indian lads. We stopped at a small clearing and sat down, and after a few minutes several of the boys began to pray. Some made supplication for the success of the allies, while others prayed for a happy return to their fathers and mothers, or to their families. George Strangling Wolf, while praying, took a needle out of his “housewife” (a soldier‘s name for a sewing kit) and inserted it into the skin near his knee. He then took an army knife and sliced off that portion of the flesh which he was holding out taut with the needle. Pointing in the direction of the sun, and still holding the small portion of bloody flesh in his hand, George offered the following prayer:

Help me, Sun, to survive this terrible war, that I may meet my relatives again. With this request, I offer you my body as food.

He then dug a small hole in the ground with his finger and buried the bloody thing he was holding. Strangling Wolf was a strong adherent to the ancient beliefs of his forefathers.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual10,ritual of assembly,"Ritual of the Assembly.

The assembly of the tribe meets in a definite place, which thus traditionally represents the center of the social life of the various peoples who make up the tribe. The meeting starts with a ritual sacrifice. Such a sacrifice is peculiar to each tribe. Thus the Mant[unknown]an ‘Abdull[unknown]ah at the beginning of their assembly sacrifice a camel, an ox, a sheep, and a lamb. The offering of each victim is made by one of the component peoples of the tribe, in order of progeniture: the D[unknown]uläyo offer the camel, the Barisä the ox, the Dinlä the sheep, the Uh[unknown]eliye the lamb. Here are my notes on this sacrifice at the assembly of the Mant[unknown]an ‘Abdull[unknown]ah that I attended in October, 1920:

The assembly of the Mant[unknown]an ‘Abdull[unknown]ah traditionally meets on the shore of the Indian Ocean in the locality that has the name of Hab[unknown]ay Garab ‘addä. Such a locality has the name of an ancestor of the Mant[unknown]an ‘Abdull[unknown]ah, who precisely was called Hab[unknown]ay and had the nickname of ‘White Shoulders’ (Garab-‘addä) . Hab[unknown]ay is buried near the sea, on the margin of the esplanade where the assembly gathers.

The assembly begins with the ritual ceremonies. The armed men of the various peoples, in order of primogeniture, with the chiefs at the head of each group, complete a circuit around the grave of Hab[unknown]ay. Songs are raised:

abôta â k[unknown]u nimidé
abôtayó aurád na sî
Grandmother, we came to you.
Grandmother, give us the good auspice!

The group of armed men from the first-born D[unknown]uläyo people is preceded by the hereditary chief of the tribe, the Mal[unknown]aq, who leads by the bridle the camel intended for the sacrifice. Thus, after the circuit around the grave of Hab[unknown]ay, the group of the D[unknown]ulayo makes the camel travel through the whole field of the assembly from the hill of B[unknown]ur Kurus, where the D[unknown]uläyo arrived, as far as the wells. The camel is stopped at the place of the sacrifice. The Mal[unknown]aq and the chief of the Barisä (the second-born people) give the orders for the drawing up of the armed men. When the armed men participating in the assembly are drawn up, the chiefs leave the ranks and gather in a group. The camel remains in the middle of the assembly, between the group of the chiefs and the ranks; it is held by a cord by the Mal[unknown]aq. The hereditary chief recites the first sura of the Koran, which is followed by the traditional ‘benedictions’ of the tribe, auguring prosperity, abundance, and victory. Then the clients of the tribe are called into the group of the chiefs: a blacksmith of low caste under the patronage of the Mant[unknown]an ‘Abdull[unknown]ah, a [unknown]S[unknown]e[unknown]h[unknown]al mendicant likewise under the patronage of the tribe. They recite in order a series of ‘benedictions’ for the Mant[unknown]an tribe. When the blacksmith and the mendicant have been dismissed, the Mal[unknown]aq gives the signal for the sacrifice. He cuts the throat of the animal, which is standing (contrary to the customary practice of considering licit only the meat of animals slaughtered on the ground) with one dagger stroke. The armed men hasten up from all the ranks, and each one dips his lance into the sacrifical blood, then hastily scattering in all directions.

At the head of each ‘hand’ then walked its mal[unknown]aq, while at the rear went the gar[unknown]ad, who was an elder of the ‘freed’ of the group. Having arrived at the place of the assembly, the armed groups placed themselves in a circle, while in the middle of the circle the chiefs of the peoples met in council. When the council was finished, the assembly was informed about the deliberations with this ritual. The chief of the tribe called the oldest gar[unknown]ad: Au Garâd! ‘Papa Gar[unknown]ad!’ The gar[unknown]ad answered: sô amra! ‘Command!’ The tribal chief replied: Ilâhi wên hâ kû amro! d[unavailable]ki h[unknown] kû dara[unknown]g[unknown]ayo! ‘May great God command you! May people respect you!’ The tribal chief briefly sets forth the decisions of the council, and each of the chiefs of the peoples, in order of primogeniture, approaches his company and sets forth those decisions to each ‘hand.’ The old gar[unknown]ad already called upon by the tribal chief, after the armed men of the ‘hands’ have raised their lances as a sign of approval, offers the sacrifice. The victim is an ox, which is slaughtered according to the Mussulman rite. Then the ‘hand’ of the first-born people, followed by the others in order, complete a circuit around the sacrificed victim, singing (alliteration with g ):

ga[unknown]sân g[unknown]ulêd, G[unknown]uló, na sî! ‘O G[unknown]ul, give us a lucky shield’ ( 1 ).

The assembly of the Hassang[unknown]ab ‘[unknown]Eli tribe traditionally takes place in the clearing of S[unknown]ifad‘addä. When the armed men of the various peoples of the tribe have gathered, the ritual ceremonies start with the one of the simulated attack on the ‘Black Hill’ (B[unknown]ur Mad[unknown]óu), which is a ridge that rises in the center of the field of the assembly. The armed men hastily fling themselves with lances in hand into the assault on the ‘Hill,’ emitting war cries. Then they come back, the ranks of each people are formed and the chiefs of each people gather around the chief of the tribe (who among the Hassan-g[unknown]ab ‘Eli is not hereditary, but elective). Then the propiatory sacrifices are performed. The victims are offered by the various peoples of the tribe. There are thus sacrificed: an ox, two sheep, and two goats. The victims are slaughtered according to the Mussulman rite. At the end of the assembly the closing rites are performed. They are: the yab[unknown]oh, which is the collection, from the various peoples, of livestock and money for the poor of the tribe; and finally the ‘benedictions’ for the prosperity and success of the tribe, which are recited by the chief (elective) at the end of the meeting.",1,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual11,"tuf, healing ritual","Religious Healing.

Turning now to the religion, diin, it should be observed that in religious forms of treatment there is a greater emphasis on the role of the expert than is the case with the herbal treatments. While there is a considerable amount of competence with regards to medical plants among laymen, people are more inclined to turn directly to an expert in cases where they prefer a “religious” cure for a disease.

The emphasis given to the religious experts does not only apply to contexts of healing. In Somali society there is a profound dichotomization of phenomena associated with religion and phenomena seen as profane or mundane. Ideally every Somali man is thought of as either a warranleh, a spear-bearer, or as a wadaad, a man of religion. In the same way religious knowledge, cilmi, is separate from knowledge of worldly matters, called dhuug or caqli . The religion is seen as providing a system of non-disputable norms which stand opposed to the worldly and debatable norms. Cultural and customary decrees (dhaqan) may be explicitly contrasted with what is required by the religion (diin) . To express that something is “compulsory” or khasab means that it is prescribed by the religion. In traditional courts one can also find conflicts about which set of standards should be applied: is the verdict to be given in conformity with the Islamic law ( sharciiya ) or should Somali customary law ( xeer soomaaliyeed ) be used? These facts form a necessary background for understanding the integrity of religious phenomena and the way in which “religion” is seen as an independent system (see Chapter 3).

As in treatments based on plants there are in religious healing several levels of concrete therapy. The first form of treatment resorted to in almost every form of disease is the transfer of blessings via saliva. This is called tuf, which means “to spit”, and it is done by pronouncing for instance the words Ilaahi caafimaad ha ku siiyo, “God will give you health”, while actually spitting on the sick person. For a more effective cure, a wadaad is sent for and asked to recite a part of the Qur’an while spitting in the same manner. The essential element of this cure is not the saliva but the words and benevolence of God. Incense may also be burnt to call the attention of the angels ( malaa’iggo ) or the assistant spirits ( rooxaan ).

At this level of treatment any Qur’anic school teacher can assist and in addition there are a large number of men and women who engage in such easier forms of religious therapy. To mark that this category of specialists does not possess great religious knowledge they are sometimes called by the term kitaab gaablow . Literally this means “the one with the short book” and it indicates that they do not know the whole of the Qur’an. Particularly favoured by such experts are the surahs Yaasiin and Fataxo, which are sometimes described as the “heart” and the “cover” of the Qur’an.

A more advanced form of religious therapy requires greater knowledge. A distinct trait of the therapy offered by the more skilled experts is that people in general do not fully comprehend how they go about it, nor are they expected to. Advanced religious therapy is based on certain concepts of the individual which are called burji . As I have described in Chapter 4 this is the astral constellation a person is born in and it also implies that the person possesses a certain potential force. For curing disease, and also for curing conditions such as childlessness or to establish contact with the opposite sex, the task for the appointed wadaad is to alter the burji of the person so that the disease is defeated, or so that other desired effects result. Knowledge of somebody’s burji can be gained either by knowing his date of birth or by using the person’s name with the name of his mother added. If the latter procedure is chosen the names are written in Arabic and the position numbers assigned to each one of the characters in the Arabic alphabet are then added together. This sum is by further calculations made to correspond with the number of a particular burji .

This is about as far as a layman’s knowledge goes. The techniques that are then used for altering the burji remain known only to the specialists. Essentially, what the experts do is to utilize the links that the burji is believed to have with other phenomena. For instance it is held that a burji may be male ( lab ) or female ( dheddig ). Every burji is also connected with one or several of the seven skies ( todooba samadood ). It also has connections with the astral bodies, with the four elements and with different organs of the body. In brief, the notion of burji rests on the assumption of correspondences between various elements of the cosmos. Since I have already given attention to these aspects of the concept of burji (Chapter 4), I shall here repeat only the most central points: There is considerable discrepancy between the interpretations of burji given by different experts. The interpretations and the different calculations required are performed with the help of Arabic books and are regarded as a part of the “secret knowledge” called asraar or cilmi sireed . Depending on what books the expert has access to, the interpretation of a person’s burji will vary. It should also be noted that several of the symbols which appear in these consultations do not correspond to objects identified in other circumstances. The four elements, for instance, are not parts of Somali cosmology. Another factor is the use of Arabic throughout the treatments, which confers a shroud of obscurity to the religious therapy.

The alteration of a person’s burji that one aims at establishing, is to some extent determined by the disease from which the patient suffers and in what part of the body it can be located (cf. note 1). In one case when a woman was suffering from pain in the chest, it was determined that it was her heart, the qalbi, that was causing the illness. The woman’s burji was calculated by an expert who also established a number for the star which bears the name qalbi . The number of the woman’s burji was added to that of the star and the sum reached was the number fifteen. He then drew a diagram of three by three squares and wrote an Arabic character in each square. The position numbers of these characters would add up to fifteen in each row of squares. On the same paper he then wrote the surah Yaasiin, which, as I have mentioned is the “heart” of the Qur’an. The paper was folded carefully and the woman subsequently had it put into a cover of leather, a xersi, to bear around her neck.

Other experts may instead prefer to make the same calculations on a wooden board for Qur’anic citations ( loox ). The inscription is then washed off the board with (ideally) rose-water and preserved under the name taxaliil . Taxaliil is usually administered orally but it can also be used to sponge a swelling or wound. In either case, whether a xersi is produced or a solution of taxaliil, the curative powers are within the words, figures and citations written down, not in the various vehicles that transmit them.

What I particularly wish to draw attention to regarding healing derived from the religion, is that it is intimately bound up with the view of religious knowledge as separate from mundane knowledge. We have seen how the different techniques within the religious therapeutic forms comprise concepts and assumptions that are only partially comprehensible from the horizon of the patients. Not least the use of the Arabic language provides the treatments with an air of divinely sanctioned truths. Just as religious knowledge stands apart from the mundane, religious specialists are defined as distinct from other roles and statuses. Turning now to the last type of therapeutic form, we will see that there are some very definite similarities with the pattern we have just outlined.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual12,ordination of buddhist priest,"For Priests and Nuns.

For these professional workers, there are several grades of initiation. Upon assuming the whole Ten Commandments a young boy was admitted to the Order as an acolyte. He was called by the Indian name, ‘Shami,’ which has been taken into the Korean language along with the word ‘Shramana’ or ‘Biku’ for priest, and ‘Bikuni’ for nun, and ‘Upasaka’ for devout layman.”

“A layman wishing to become a semi-professional priest could do so by taking a certain Fifty Vows called the ‘Posalkei.’ Two at least of the Kings of Korea (in 1045 and 1054) did this. A regular priest has to be over twenty years of age, and takes two hundred and fifty vows. A ‘Bikuni’ or nun is compelled to take five hundred vows. Priestly ordination is called ‘receiving the fire’ (pool tatta). When these vows are taken by the priests and nuns, a bit of candle wick soaked in grease is laid on the inner side of the left arm just below the elbow, and set on fire. (52) It inflicts a burn and leaves a scar, so that they can never disavow having followed this vocation. (53) In China, this burning is done on the top of the head. (54)

“Formerly ordinations could be held only at Tongtosa and Haiinsa monasteries in the south, as they alone had ‘Keitan,’ altars, but now they are held in all of the larger temples, especially the thirty-two head temples mentioned in the last lecture. The altar of Tongtosa is not a complicated three-story construction such as they have in Japan, but simply a long, narrow shelf affair of black wood extending clear across the building. It is about four feet high, and has several narrow shelves one above the other stepped back, and, upon these, tablets are placed and various ornaments. No one ascends the altar as in Japan. They simply stand in front of it.

Directly in front of the altar at Tongtosa, a filmy curtain of some red material hangs from the lofty ceiling, and beyond that is a great audience chamber where sermons are delivered at times to several hundreds of people at once. Near the curtain is a curious pulpit flat-topped with a low rail six inches high around the back and two sides. It looks like any ordinary pulpit except for the rail. The abbot told me that the speaker in their meetings always sat cross-legged on top of that pulpit, instead of standing 68 behind it as Westerners do. As the audience sits on the floor and the speaker also, unless the latter's seat is elevated, most of them cannot see him. Madame Gordon speaks of the wonderful ‘Empty Altar’ of Tongtosa, and tells how it was never used for any purpose except when the invisible Buddha himself descended to speak to his people. (55) It is another pretty story but the abbot said that he was the only one who ever sat there. Interpreters are sometimes too ‘helpful’ altogether.”

“Formerly at least ten priests had to be present when an acolyte (Shami) was ordained. Now three or four are sufficient. Now they quite often wait for priest ordinations until there are a large number to be taken in, thirty if possible, but even that is not required. These ordinations occur only in two or three years nowadays, as relatively few people are entering the Order. It occurs most often on Buddha's birthday, the eighth day of the fourth lunar month. No spectators are allowed. At the ceremony, three older priests preside, one as Chairman (Hwasangsa), one on his left as First Assistant (Kalmasa), and the other on his right as the (Kyosoosa) Exhorter, this last being evidently the one giving the pastoral charge. Seven ‘Chinsa,’ or witnessing priests take part, and there are about ten Ilyu, or serving men. The two hundred and fifty vows are asked, and made and the arm-burning seals it all. The newly ordained priest assumes the ‘kasa’ robe, a sort of toga that covers all of the body except the right shoulder and arm. This toga is made of about one hundred and twenty-five tiny bits of cloth, and usually has the names of the Four Heavenly Kings or Divas on the corners. The cloth is purposely torn into these small bits and sewn together again, so as to deprive it of all commerical value, and keep up the appearance of complete poverty even when the kasa is new. (56) It is always worn during ceremonies and worship services and may be worn at all times. It is usually red or yellowish in colour, but may be blue, and the ribbons may be multi-coloured.”

“The only knowledge absolutely required of one who would be a priest today is the ability to repeat the Sikkyung or grace at 69 meals, (57) the Chunsoo, or the morning and evening prayer dharani sentences and the Songchoo, which are certain general prayer sentences in Sanscrit.

In the modern schools an effort is made to give a great deal more of training than this, and priests are now graded into eight classes according to their education. Those educated in the formal Buddhist schools of today, primary, through secondary to college, eight years in all, at graduation become ‘Taisa,’ or ‘Great Teacher.’ Two years later, if they have done well, they are promoted to ‘Choongtuk,’ or ‘Medium Merit.’ Two years still later again, they become ‘Taituk,’ ‘Great Merit,’ and finally two years later, ‘Taikyosa,’ which might be something like Doctor of Divinity. Those who have not taken the formal course but have studied privately and in summer schools and the like, after ten years of supervised study become ‘Taisun,’ then ‘Choongtuk,’ then ‘Sunsa,’ and lastly ‘Taisunsa,’ these terms being translatable literally with much the same words as the above four, but representing a slightly lesser degree of standing. The above is the ideal scheme, but, as a matter of fact, there is a good deal of chaos in the grading practically. ”

“When a priest is ordained, he is said to leave the active work-a-day world entirely. He drops his citizen name, and adopts the name of Buddha. If one meets a priest on the road and asks his name, he will answer, ‘I am Saka,’ i.e., ‘I am Buddha.’ If you want his citizen name, you must ask particularly for it (Sokineui Irhom). It is a pretty custom said to have been introduced by Doan, a famous Chinese monk in the state of Wei in the sixth century.”

“The priests are supposed to be strict vegetarians, as the Order has required that ever since the beginning. Some do practise it, but, my college president friend said that they were allowed to eat meat when very hungry if they had not seen or heard the animal being killed. He called attention to the legend that Buddha himself died from eating boar's flesh. He said that the story of that incident was in a book called Sunchon Chulhak , or ‘Philosophy of the Sun Sect.’ ”

“The priests are recruited largely from indigent families living near the temples. Boys are taken into the temples and girls into the nunneries in childhood and at first act simply as servants. As they get older, they begin to study and finally qualify. The modern schools try to shorten that period and some few candidates come from those who have simply studied in the schools.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual13,public worship and sermon,"Ceremonies.

All of the ceremonies, public and private, of the cult [ER: Chuntokyo] and most of its doctrines centre around that twenty-one character magic Formula which Choi Chei Oo received and made the basis of it all. It reads:

‘Chi Keui Keum Chi Wun Wi Tai Kang
Si Chun Chu Cho Hwa Chung
Yung Sei Pool Mang Man Sa Ji.’

This has been variously translated by Mr. Junkin (20) and by others, (21) all apparently translating simply the Chinese characters as they stand and not as they are understood by the Chuntokyo men themselves. As nearly as I can judge, they feel it to mean:

‘Infinite Energy being now within me, I yearn that it may pour into all living beings and created things

Since this Infinite Energy abides in me, I am identified with God, and of one nature with all existence.

Should I ever forget these things, all existing things will know of it.’ ”

2. Public Worship

In the public worship, the procedure is much the same, the bowl of water being placed upon the wooden pulpit in the meeting room. The interior of their churches resembles very much the Christian churches, with rostrum and pulpit. Behind the pulpit in the Seoul cathedral is a great high cabinet containing the tablets of the Founders. Most of the buildings are simple halls dedicated to their purpose.

Whenever the members assemble for a worship-service, as they enter the building, each individual bows first and goes through a ceremony which they call ‘Yum Chun Yum Sa,’ ‘Think Heaven, Think of Matter.’ They have oral preaching in the services, but never have oral prayer. This silent bowing takes the place of it. It is an adoration of something, but of what it is difficult to say. There is chanting of a hymn or two from the Palpyunsa, the leaders often lining it out a line at a time, as they used to do in the Pilgrim Fathers' time, the audience repeating the line as sung. The sermon consists of a ten or fifteen minute address upon some moral subject or an exposition of some of their sacred book. Over and over during the service, they pause and Yum Chun Yum Sa. At the close of the meeting, a number of selected members of the congregation go forward and, dipping up some of the water in the bowl with spoons that are laid beside it, they drink it. The actual worship service is characterized by quite a degree of solemnity.

We have here described the very choicest of their services. As a matter of fact, the customs have had so little time to crystallize and set themselves that one may find a very different service from this in the first church that he visits after reading this. In some places, there is a great deal of confusion and passing in and out and whispering. Sometimes there is no preaching or reading of the sacred books at all. Sometimes there will be a debate rather than a sermon. There are no set rules at all. Usually there is at least relative quiet and reverence during the Yum Chun Yum Sa part of the services.”",1,1,0,0,0,0

Ritual16,Healing koot/kut,"The Mootang's Koot for Healing Disease

Of all of the activities of the Shamans, probably this is more like the cult of Siberia than anything else in Chosen. We have mentioned already the fact that the Mootang in her official ceremonies wears the outer dress of a man, as the Paksoo, her male imitator, wears the outer dress of a woman. We have mentioned the iron disks that she wears on her robe, and the iron swords or 212 tridents that she carries in her hand. She also has a sort of rattle called Pangool, made of bits of iron and wire, and quite often has upon her head a round helmet of bronze. There are many Mootangs who do not have these iron-spangled properties, but wear simply a round felt horsehair hat with a two-inch rim, and the blue or red, split-half-way-up-the-back over-garments such as used to be worn by petty officials around the Korean Court. These women also Shamanize but they do not have the prestige of those who are fully equipped in the ancient way. ”

“The drums of Siberia are said to be all round or oval. Those of Korea are usually shaped like an hour-glass and are about three feet long, and possibly fourteen inches in diameter. Some are the size and shape of snare drums. They are beaten with the hands alone, one hand on each drumhead, or with a baton in certain definite ways which take a long time to learn. Along with the drum, they always use also a small trumpet-like horn which makes a wailing, mournful sound not very pleasant to uninitiated ears. Two assistants, one of them usually the woman's husband, preside over the drum and the pipes, leaving the Mootang free. ”

“First, sacrificial blood is shed, of a chicken, or pig, or dog, and a generous meal of rice and other things with this meat is prepared. An awning is spread overhead covering the courtyard of the house, and thick grain-drying mats are spread over the ground. When the meal is ready, it is placed upon a small tablet and set out in the courtyard on the mats, and then the drums begin to sound, the pipes to wail and the Mootang to dance. She holds in her hands the sword or trident, or sometimes only a fan, and she postures and dances, calling out to the spirits from time to time and inviting them to join the revelry. Faster and faster she goes, whirling like a dervish, leaping high in the air. Her eyes flash wildly. Even the sound of her voice changes. People shrink away from her in fear. Sometimes, to help her, one of her assistants will take a basket and scrape upon it, making a sound like that which the boys make on the rocks along the river bank when they try to entice fresh-water crabs out from under big stones. On and on she goes, calling and calling to the spirits to come and join her, begging them to come, cajoling them with all sorts of [illustration on opposite page] 213 promises, explaining the wonderful feast that has been prepared, reminding them of their friendship to her, teasing, joking, pleading. Sometimes she gets absolutely exhausted and falls down almost in a faint without getting any results. She lies still a while, and then arises and begins again, or a companion takes her place and they serve alternately, calling and calling. Sometimes the spirits are quite obdurate, and the Koot has to go on for days, usually when there is extra money to be had for the extra effort. New food has to be prepared if they go too long. The séances are mostly in the night and often last all night long. Sometimes they stop at morning time, and then go on the following night.

Usually, sooner or later, a change comes, and she announces that the evil spirit has come out of the sick person and is partaking of the feast. Then she must use some device to persuade the spirit to go away after eating, and not to go back into the person who was ill. She does this sometimes by cajolery and perhaps more often with guile. Among her properties will be a small horse sometimes, made of woven straw. She will beg the spirit to mount the horse at the end of the meal, and, when he has done so, she will seize the horse, run out the door and throw it up into a tree or into a stream. The poor, simple-minded evil spirit cannot find his way back to the same house again, so the sick person gets well. ”

3. The Pansoo's Koot for Ejecting Spirits That Trouble

The technique of the Pansoo, as befits its Chinese origin, runs along with more of decorum, although with no less of intensity. Naturally, the blind man does not dance, so that at once changes everything. He has the drum, however, and beats it entirely himself, sitting on the floor of the porch with his helpers standing around. First of all, he has the ceiling of the porch marked off into wards like the four wards of the heavens, and puts up in each and at the zenith, the banners of the Five-Point Generals. One assistant sits before him, holding perpendicularly (90) a club of peach wood about a foot long, the same resting at its bottom on a 214 solid slab of wood. Other assistants stand around with leafy branches from the peach tree, which is particularly feared by the demons. (91)

The Pansoo begins to boom the drum and recite sections of the Okju Kyung and other books which he has learned. His first purpose is to get into communciation with his own friendly Sinchangso, or single Sinchang, if he has but one. Sometimes this part of the ceremony will take two or three hours or more, sometimes longer. Every little while, the Pansoo stops and asks towards his assistant's club. ‘Have you come?’ If the Sinchang is not there, the club will wag wildly from side to side, no matter how much force the assistant puts in to hold it. The Ouija board, so popular in the Christian Occident, was in use in Korea when England was still populated with savages.

At last, when he asks, the club no longer wags from side to side, but bounces up and down. Then the Pansoo asks until he finds from what ward of the heavens the spirits comes who is troubling the household or institution. Learning that, he begins to call the roll of the various spirits in that ward of the heavens who might be the guilty one, and he keeps on until he finds the culprit. Then he begins to read the books in earnest, putting pressure upon the guilty one, beating him, overwhelming him, benumbing him with his great and powerful formul[unknown] . Presently he asks in what part of the house the spirit is keeping himself, and, finding that, the assistants rush into that place with the peach branches and drive him out, chasing him from place to place until he comes up on the porch where the Pansoo is.

The Pansoo has all prepared and ready an earthenware or stone bottle and a lump of buckwheat dough. The harassed spirit is ordered to enter the bottle and is unable to resist longer. He goes in, the assistant jams the dough in for a cork, and the bottle is taken out on the hills and buried. Perhaps some Aladdin or Sinbad of future years, digging around on Korea's mountains, will find some of these bottles and some very troublesome genii in them.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual16,Healing koot/kut,"The Kut Begins

In the fading afternoon light the mansin set up their hourglass drum and a tray of wine and rice cake on mats outside the house gate. The wine and cake are for the spirits. The mansin yell for everyone to come out of the house, and women emerge, red faced, from the kitchen. Grandfather Ch[unknown] on, bundled into an overcoat for protection from the wind, hobbles out and sits far to the left of the drum with his cronies. Family and neighborhood women crowd around the drum. More women will join them once the drumming starts. Children wander among the women's skirts. A woman leads the ox out from the enclosed courtyard. Another woman yodels for the dog, who bounds out of the gate. When the mansin hit the drum to start the kut , no one dares remain inside the house, and all stand wide of the overhanging roof. With the sound of the drum, gods inside the empty house open wide their eyes. This is a dangerous moment. Like the genie in the bottle, awakened household gods seize upon whatever greets their gaze.

Yongsu's Mother hits the drum. Okky[unknown] ong's Mother hits the cymbals. The Chatterbox Mansin declares before the gods and ancestors that the Ch[unknown] on family is holding a kut . The mansin drive unclean, noxious influences away from the house. They invite gods from mountains and distant places to enter the house and be entertained.

The Chatterbox Mansin takes a long blue vest from the top of the drum. She dances, pumping her arms up and down, jumping on the balls of her feet. She stops and scowls at the offering tray. She flings wide her vest and hisses, “There is a Great Spirit in this house, there is, there is.”

One of the greedy supernatural Officials (Taegam) has possessed the Chatterbox Mansin. The Officials make trouble when they see wealth --money and posessions--going into the house. The family should share their good fortune, give the Officials a cup of wine. This particular Official is the Soldier (Kunung Taegam), one of the worst. He prowls outside the house wall, spying on the family. The Soldier Official chides Grandmother Ch[unknown] on for the paucity of her offerings. No supernatural Official is ever satisfied with the offerings. Grandmother Ch[unknown] on promises more and better food later if the Official will make her husband well. This exchange is stereotypic, repeated throughout this and other kut . Grandmother Ch[unknown] on knows her part. If she did not, Yongsu's Mother and Okky[unknown] ong's Mother would coach her from the drum or importune the god on her behalf.

With another burst of drumming and dance, the Chatterbox Mansin removes her costume. She takes up a dried fish that has been offered to the Official, breaks the head off the fish with her foot, and flings it into the fields, casting scraps of food and cupfuls of wine in its wake. Officials, ghosts, and noxious influences eat, drink, and depart. The mansin flings down the fish. The decapitated trunk points inward, toward the open gate of the house. Some noxious influences remain. Quickly, she pours and tosses more cups of wine, and again she casts down the fish. The trunk points out, toward the fields. This first batch of spirits is satisfied.

The women follow Yongsu's Mother, still hitting the drum, through the gate and into the courtyard to the edge of the wooden porch. At her side, Okky[unknown] ong's Mother hits the cymbals and, over the din, the two mansin proclaim that the kut is now within the walls.

Rites within the Walls

The mansin , the anthropologist, and the Ch[unknown] on family eat a hasty meal. The Chatterbox Mansin performs a drum song on the porch, singing out the names and ages of all the Ch[unknown] on family, announcing them to the gods. She names the married son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren, but not the daughter, who is married into another family.

The mansin expel pollutions ( puj[unknown] ong ) accumulated in the house through birth, death, and profane existence since the last ritual cleansing. While the Chatterbox Mansin sings, Yongsu's Mother waves one dipper of pure water and another of purifying agents--ash, salt, and red pepper 1   --over the offering food and across all of the furniture in the inner room. The house is clean.

The Chatterbox Mansin now sings long lists of household gods, major and minor, inviting them to enter the house, Grandmother Ch[unknown] on lights the candles on the offering trays, sets down two thousand-won bills, and bows with her head to the floor. She bows a full dozen bows. The Chatterbox Mansin finishes her song and smokes a cigarette.

The next sequence is for the Ch[unknown] on family's ancestors. But several gods appear first, leading the ancestors back to the house. Each category of god has a special costume. The Chatterbox Mansin, in a jade green robe, summons the family's accumulated distant dead. She waves her tasseled exorcism wands across the porch and through the inner room, then flings them down. The wands point out toward the open courtyard. The distant dead are satisfied; their influence is gone.

Now the Chatterbox Mansin wears a broad-sleeved red robe and carries a high-crowned red hat. The most regal gods in the pantheon wear this costume as kings or magistrates. She faces the open court yard with an open fan spread in front of her face. The fan trembles as the Mountain God descends into the mansin . This is the Mountain God of the Ch[unknown] on family's ancestral home (Ponhyang Sansin), the god who reigns over and pacifies the ancestors in their hillside graves. The Mountain God chides Grandmother Ch[unknown] on for neglect. Grandmother Ch[unknown] on spreads a bill on the Mountain God's open fan. The Mountain God tells her, “Don't worry, Lady Ch[unknown] on, I will make your husband well. I will make you rich. I will help your son become rich. I will help your grandchildren speak well and write well.”

The Chatterbox Mansin removes the red robe, revealing the green robe again underneath. Twelve suicides who serve as netherworldly guards ( kamang ) appear. Grandmother Ch[unknown] on places another bill on the mansin's fan. Now the Chatterbox Mansin puts on a yellow robe for the Great Spirit Grandmother, the god who will lead the Ch[unknown] on family ancestors into the home. This is the powerful and angry god most directly responsible for Grandfather Ch[unknown] on's illness. The Great Spirit Grandmother picks up the mansin's huge battle fork and broadsword and jabs at the tub of rice cake the family has prepared for her. She indicates, raising her arms high, what a huge pile of rice cake she craves. She grabs the married daughter, drags her up to the wooden porch, and makes her bow before the offering tray. Like the other gods, the Great Spirit Grandmother berates Grandmother Ch[unknown] on. Grandmother Ch[unknown] on retorts, “Then make us rich, and next time we'll give you more.”


Mansin Teams at Kut

As a mansin gains experience, her reputation for performing kut grows, and other mansin include her in their teams when they do kut . I have seen a minimum of three mansin perform cheap, quick kut in crowded rented rooms. Six mansin performed a kut to dispatch a dead bachelor's restless soul and cure his cousin's debilitating headaches. The family spared no expense, the house was full of guests, and the final send-off of dead souls lasted until the late afternoon of the second day.

A mansin makes from ten to fifteen thousand won per kut . The number of invitations she receives from other mansin depends on her known skill and her ability to work well with other mansin . Because the Officials and the Spirit Warrior “play well” with Yongsu's Mother, other mansin invite her to perform these exhausting but highly entertaining and lucrative segments at kut . The Death Messenger plays well with the Mansin from Within the Wall, so well that her performance scared me. Yongsu's Mother invites the Mansin from Within the Wall when she does a kut to send off dead souls.

Kut teams form and reform following subtle rules of reciprocity. One mansin invites another, but if the favor is not returned, she invites someone else. If a mansin feels that she has not received fair recompence for her efforts at a kut organized by another mansin , she does not invite her to perform in her own kut and is reluctant to participate in future kut .

According to Yongsu's Mother, the Chatterbox Mansin is excessively greedy. When she performs the drum song at the start of a kut, she always claims the two thousand-won bills the housewife fastens to the drum strings at the start of the song. The money does not go into the common bag tied to the drum. When she does the final send-off, the Chatterbox Mansin also takes that money for herself. She is tightfisted when she divides the common take among the mansin she has invited to a kut . Yongsu's Mother says that other mansin used to invite the Chatterbox Mansin far and wide to do kut, but they avoid her now. But the Chatterbox Mansin is successful in her own career and does not have to depend on the good graces of other mansin . She has collected numerous regular clients in her twenty years' practice and claims the grudging loyalty of Okky[unknown] ong's Mother and Yongsu's Mother, the two mansin she initiated. Between kut for her own clients and kut for the other two mansin 's clients, she is sufficiently busy and prosperous. During the time I knew her, she moved from Willow Market to a new house she had purchased in Righteous Town.

In the same year Yongsu's Mother also drew closer to the older Clear Spring Mansin. The Clear Spring Mansin advised her to break with the Chatterbox Mansin and divined that Yongsu's Mother's gods would be happier if she did. Yongsu's Mother performed an exorcism for the Clear Spring Mansin's son when his injured leg would not heal. The Clear Spring Mansin read Yongsu's Mother's pulse when she was ill and recommended an herb doctor. In the same year the Clear Spring Mansin broke with her own spirit daughter in a bitter quarrel that arose when Yongsu's Mother caught the spirit daughter secreting away some of the money she had collected during a kut.

The mansin teams at kut are open and flexible. They form and reform from kut to kut , and a mansin works with a variety of other mansin during a year. Yet a mansin tends to favor certain of her colleagues out of longtime loyalty or to maintain reciprocity. Mansin who work often and well together develop close ties. They divine for each other and summon up each other's gods. But these are also potentially volatile professional relationships, formed around an arbitrary division of cash for services rendered. There is ample ground for jealousy and backbiting.


Women Who Come to the Mansin's House

A shaman's divination ( mug[unknown] ori ) is the first step in any ritual therapy. Women like Grandmother Ch[unknown] on come to the mansin's house when they suspect that malevolent forces lurk behind a sudden or persistent illness or domestic strife. In Yongsu's Mother's shrine I heard reports of inflamed lungs, an infected leg, fits of possession “craziness,” alchoholism, and dreamy, wandering states of mind. One woman, afflicted with this last complaint, feared that she was god-descended, but Yongsu's Mother laughed off her worries and divined more commonplace godly displeasure as the source of her problems. Other women who came to the shrine worried about their husbands' or sons' career prospects, or about sudden financial reverses. Should the husband switch jobs? Would the son receive his security clearance to work in Saudi Arabia? Thieves had broken into the family rice shop, what did that presage? Other women were anxious that adulterous husbands might abandon them. Some had only the vaguest suspicion that their spouses had “smoked the wind,” but one young woman was certain that her husband took the grain his mother sent up from the country and shared it with his mistress. One woman, caught in a compromising position by her enraged spouse, had fled to the mansin in fear of life and limb. And still other women asked about wayward children, stepchildren, or grandchildren whose transgressions ranged from mild rebelliousness to Christian zealotry, petty theft, and delinquency. A mother-in-law asked how she should deal with a runaway daughter-in-law. A daughter-in-law who had fled home asked if she should divorce her husband. An older woman wondered if she should join a married son's household (see app. 2).

The mansin chats with the women before fetching the divination tray. Sometimes the women begin to discuss their anxieties before the actual divination, but these are usually long-standing clients. Clients who come to the mansin for the first time tend to hold back and see how much the mansin can uncover in the divination.

The mansin brings in the divination tray, an ordinary low tray of the sort used for meals in any Korean home. The tray bears a mound of rice grains, a handful of brass coins (imitations of old Chinese money), and the brass bell rattle a mansin uses to summon up her visions.

“Well now, let's see,” says the mansin , settling down to a kneeling posture behind her tray. The client places a bill under the pile of grain on the tray. At Yongsu's Mother's shrine in 1977 and 1978, this fee was usually five-hundred or a thousand won. Now the mansin shakes the brass bells beside her own ear and chants, asking the gods to send “the correct message.” She receives a message for each member of the client's family, beginning with the client's husband if he is alive. She announces each subject's name and age to the gods, tosses her coins on the tray, and spills handfuls of rice grains until the Great Spirit Grandmother speaks and sends visions.

Coin and rice configurations hint at the client's concerns. A broad spread of coins bespeaks quarrels between husband and wife or parent and child, or betrays financial loss. A long line of coins broken by one or two solitary coins at the end tells of someone leaving home, a change of employment, a death, or the inauspicious influence of an ancestor who died far from home. A few grains spilled on the floor caution financial prudence; the client should postpone switching jobs or buying a house.

The mansin describes a situation and asks for confirmation. “Your husband has a cold or something, is that it?” “Your thirteen-year-old daughter doesn't get along with her father, is that right?” The mansin develops the theme, weaving her visions together with her client's information. With more tosses of coins and grain, the Great Spirit Grandmother sends more specific visions. “I see a steep embankment. Is there something like that near your house?” The woman and her neighbor nod affirmation. “Be careful of that place.” To another woman, “Your daughter has two suitors. One is quite handsome. The other is extremely clever but also very meticulous. Since your daughter isn't especially clever herself, she'll have a better life if she marries the second suitor, but she must watch her step and scrupulously manage her house.”

Sometimes she sights the discontented gods and ancestors of her clients' households. “Is there a distant grandfather in your family who carried a sword and served inside the palace?” “Did someone in your family die far from home and dripping blood?” She circles in on the supernatural source of her client's problems and suggests an appropriate ritual to mollify a greedy god's demands or send a miserable and consequently dangerous soul “away to a good place.”

For a housewife to evaluate the skill of an individual mansin and trust her diagnosis, she must know the supernatural history of her husband's family and of her own kin. And if the mansin is convinced that there was “a grandmother who worshiped Buddha,” or “a bride who died in childbirth,” she tells her client, “Go home and ask the old people, they know about these things.”

A foreigner, I was hopeless as a client. When Yongsu's Mother asked me if I had “an aunt or uncle [ samch'on ] who died young,” I wrote home, half hoping to unravel a bit of family history. No such ghost, my mother wrote, “unless one of your grandmothers had a secret life.” The mansin said, “We don't know how you foreigners do things in America.” When I brought a Chinese-American friend for a divination, this same mansin acknowledged their affinity as East Sea People (Tongyang Saram), and would not let unclaimed ghosts slip by. Yongsu's Mother asked if there was someone in my friend's family who had died away from home or someone who died in childbirth, an ancestor who was an official perhaps. My friend explained that her father had been kidnapped as a boy in China and raised by foster parents, that he knew nothing at all about his own family. The mansin would not accept a dead end. “When you're home for a visit, ask your mother. When the two of you are sitting around chatting, she'll tell you these things.” My friend again explained that her mother had already told her all she could about the family. Her father's origins were a mystery. Now the mansin grew concerned, appalled that a Chinese mother could send her married daughter off to set up housekeeping in a foreign land without telling her about the family ghosts and ancestors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual17,"The Family Shamas, the Chunchei or Sanchet","The Family Shamas, the Chunchei or Sanchet

Whether these should be called Shamanistic rites at all or not, I am not entirely persuaded, but they seem to be like those of the Family Shamans in Siberia, and not unlike some of those of the Mootangs and Pansoos, so we will consider them as such.

These cermonies are usually held in the Fall just after the harvest, but may be held once a quarter regularly and at other times of great calamity. The spirits supplicated are sometimes the gods of the mountains or neighbourhood, sometimes come very near to Hananim alone. In many ways, they are similiar to the Peace Offerings of the Jews.

Seven days before the ceremony, the village has ameeting and elects from among the ‘clean’ men of the village one to be a Chief Shaman or Master of Ceremonies, Chei Kwan, one to be Prayer Reader, Chook Kwan, and several to be assistants. (92) A bull without blemish is chosen, all of one solid colour, not spotted. For a week, the animal is carefully kept, immaculately clean and well fed. The men bathe, wear clean clothes, put bits of pine on each side of their front doors and a left-woven straw rope across it and red earth in front of it, to show any possible visitors that they are set aside and cannot do any business until after the sacrifice. They refrain from tobacco and liquor or fellowship with their families. No mourner or person defiled from touching a dead body is allowed to go near them.

The night before the ceremony, a small booth is erected on an elevated point of land on the mountain-side, or, if it is Chunchei, on the plain; the bull is killed by the village butcher and the meat, and particularly the blood, is placed in the booth over night, before the gods.

At cock-crow next morning, all of the men of the town assemble around the booth. The Shaman Master of Ceremonies and the Prayer Reader, clad in robes of ceremony, alone approach the booth, worshipping the spirit there. Then the Reader reads the prayer of the community, section by section, presenting petitions for good crops, for freedom from disease, for many sons, etc. After each section, the men assembled on the lower land around the booth respond with the sound, ‘A-eum, ’ equivalent to our word ‘Amen. ’ The Master of Ceremonies bows all during the reading, worshipping continuously. After the ceremony is over, the meat is divided among the villagers according to their several contributions. Part of it is taken down below the hill, cooked and eaten there in a sort of barbecue.

Those chosen to be Masters of Ceremonies and Readers are usually the same over a long period of years. Their Shamanizing, if this is Shamanizing, is only on these special days. Ordinarily they do not show much of the ‘altered mental state’ mentioned in the definition at the beginning of this discussion. If they do reveal such states, they are more appreciated. One would expect that the Mootangs or Pansoos would be called upon to do this work. They are sometimes asked to indicate favourable days for it, but are almost never asked to lead. The ceremony has no possible contact with Buddhism and only a tenuous possible connection as similar to the Sajik Shrine worship. It would seem that it is Shamanistic, and is surely an ancient custom. Possibly these men were the original Shamans, as some writers on Siberia believe that theirs were at first family ones, and later became professionals. Possibly these men are the result of a degeneration or drawing away from professional Shaman control under the influence of Confucianism and the worship of the Sajik Shrine. Each one may decide this for themselves, but these are the facts of what is done.”",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual18,Chesa (?),"The Care and Feeding of Ancestors

The father's sister is a restless ancestor.
The mother's sister is a restless ancestor.
Ky[unknown] onggi shaman chant

A division of labor bisects the ritual life of the Korean home. Women worship the gods of the house, men, the ancestors. The two spheres merge in affliction. When angry, affronted gods let the dead move among the living, the women propitiate restless ancestors and ghosts. When a family, like the Ch[unknown] on family, holds a kut to entertain the gods, the ancestors also appear and receive feast food from a special tray.

In kut the ancestor is a vocal, weepy presence filled with appetite, longing, or anger. The ancestor inspires tears of grief or compassion in the eyes of a sibling, child, or spouse, but the women also bicker with the dead: “Why did you die young then?” “We did everything we could for you [so why complain?].” “We bought you medicine when you were sick.” “Take your travel money and go.” “Go away to a good place.” By contrast, the ancestor of male rites maintains a silent, awesome presence while the men solemnly offer libations and carefully prostrate themselves.


The Male Rite

Family ancestor worship receives considerable attention in Korean ethnography; a short description will therefore suffice here. My observations come from the several rituals, or chesa , I saw in my landlord's home and in the homes of his kinsmen.

Men are born, live, and die among their close consanguineous kin. A first son inherits the household headship and eventually becomes an ancestor in his natal chip , the big house ( k'[unknown] unjip ). A secondary son establishes a related minor house ( chag[unknown] unjip ) and, after death, becomes that new chip's founding ancestor. The eternally ambiguous chip implies, in appropriate context, the separate “household” of a single son or the ritual “family” of several sons' households.

A “big house” with an unbroken tradition honors ancestors up to the fourth ascending generation ( sadaebongsa ). Branching descendants gather at the big house for chesa , an occasion for brothers, nephews, and cousins to offer libations to parents and grandparents. A secondary son offers wine and prostrates himself before the ancestors in his eldest brother's house, the house where he grew up. His own household will not hold their own chesa until he, or his wife before him, becomes an ancestor.

Senior uncles come to the house when junior kin offer ancestor rites, and are honored guests at the midnight feast immediately after the chesa . Although these elders offer advice on ritual procedure and add the final touches to the offering tray, as genealogical seniors, they neither offer wine nor prostrate themselves before genealogically junior ancestors. Sisters and daughters often return for a death-day anniversary, just as they would return for a living parent's birthday celebration. These daughters of the chip help in the kitchen and join in the feasting, but they do not offer wine in the rite itself. 1   Neither will they become ancestors in their natal chip . Marriage severs them. As mothers of sons, they will one day receive their ancestral due in their husband's house.

Two concepts of agnatic kin emerge from the assortment of relatives gathered together at a death-day anniversary. The men who offer wine dramatize the principle of patrilineal primogeniture within the chip and the hierarchical relationship between primary and secondary chip: the senior son holds chesa in his home, while younger sons and grandsons offer wine in the home of a senior son or grandson. But a more generalized group of agnatic kin, including the chip's out-married women, come from a distance to gather together for an evening of preparation and conviviality and for the rich feast of offering food after the rite.

Men hold chesa at midnight before a death anniversary and in the early mornings of lunar New Year's Day and Ch'us[unknown] ok, which is celebrated at the start of the harvest (lunar 8.15). Villagers contrast the death anniversary's solemn atmosphere with the lighter mood of holiday rites. Death anniversaries occasion a feast with food as elaborate as the family can afford. On holidays ancestors and family receive special holiday fare.

Ancestor worship is a male prerogative, and once plates of offering food are passed up onto the porch, they are in the men's hands. Women perform the essential task of preparing chesa food. Every household kitchen has its own traditions, which the eldest daughterin-law learns from her mother-in-law. When kinswomen from other households help prepare chesa food, they defer to the polite instructions of a woman who may be their junior in both age and generation. Women say that the first son's bride must be immaculate and conscientious, since she will inherit the responsibility of preparing chesa food. Women teased me that, being left-handed, I must never marry a firstborn son, since any offerings I prepared would be unacceptable to the ancestors of my husband's chip .

The form of chesa is the form of a meal. All of the food on the ancestors' tray is ready for consumption. Apples and pears have their topmost skin peeled; there are peeled and sliced chestnuts, or substitute sugar candies in the shape of sliced chestnuts that the family buys for thrift and ease in preparation. The women bring rice and soup steaming to the porch. The men, in turn, fill cups of wine and set them on the chesa tray. The master of ceremonies raps a pair of chopsticks against an empty bowl, sets the rice bowl lid ajar, and dips a few grains of rice into the soup with a spoon. Finally, he replaces the soup with a bowl of rice water to signify the meal's end. The men punctuate each step in this sequence with head-to-floor bows. They turn their backs away from the offering tray, bowing slightly from the waist, so that the ancestor may eat in peace.

Families in Enduring Pine Village do not maintain wooden tablets as permanent spirit placings ( sinwi ) for the ancestors. Instead, a skilled calligrapher prepares a temporary placing of thin rice paper with the ancestor's name and the honorary title “student” in carefully rendered Chinese characters. Immediately after the formal rite one of the men burns the spirit placing and the prepared congratulatory address. He tosses the ashes out beside the storage jars, the cleanest place in the home. In kosa , women set the Mountain God's offerings here and at the end of men's chesa , the dead return to mountain graves. Do the castaway ashes symbolize the return? I did not know enough to ask.

As soon as the men finish the chesa women take the offerings to the kitchen where they pile trays high with food to feast the men. Women and children eat last, either in a separate room or at trays the men have vacated. The etiquette of dining, like all Korean etiquette, honors hierarchial principles: first the ancestors by generational seniority, then the men by age, then the women and children. An ancestor receives the first tray of food as guest of honor at a death anniversary feast. The ancestors, by generational seniority, receive the first portions of special holiday treats--rice cake soup on New Year's morning and filled rice cake dumplings at Ch'us[unknown] ok. Family solidarity and continuity are expressed through communal feasting.

When a household head performs ancestor worship, he demonstrates ritual propriety before a broader group of kin and community. Older men impress upon younger men the momentousness of ancestor worship and the importance of correct procedure. Sloppiness and negligence in the performance of chesa is the mark of an inferior person. Men learn ritual form as they grow up. They watch rites in the home, and fathers take sons to chesa in the homes of agnatic kin. Whereas men patiently coach a boy through his libation and bows, softly chuckling at his awkwardness and hesitation, a young man receives a swift, gruff reprimand for a slight slip. By now, he should know better.

Korean social philosophers have argued that ancestor worship is no literal invocation of the ancestor's shade, but merely a metaphoric display acknowledging one's eternal obligation to parents and grandparents (Pyun 1926; Clark [1932] 1961, 114-116). The residents of Enduring Pine Village, however, use chesa to express concern for the needs and desires of remembered dead. My landlord told me, “I gave my father an extra cup of wine because he used to like wine so much.” A widow explained why she had prepared an abundance of offering food. “Before my husband died, he always felt hungry. His illness made him feel that way. He kept asking for food, but was never satisfied, so I fixed a lot for him this time.”

Sentiment and a sense of literal evocation are yet more pronounced in shaman rites where the ancestor claims a dramatic presence in the person of the possessed mansin . The dead confront the living. There is anger, there are reproaches, there is grief and repentance, but always, there is reconciliation. The ancestral sequence in kut transforms these dread and dangerous spectres into familial allies. For example, in the scheme of ancestors and ghosts, a dead first wife is expected to work at cross purposes to her husband's present wife. First wives were partly to blame for Yongsu's Father's death and for the death of Mr. Py[unknown] on. A dead first wife desires her former spouse and tries to carry him away with her. Resentful of her husband's remarriage, she stirs up trouble in the house and unsettles the children. When the dead first wife appeared in Chinsuk's Mother's kut , she flung open the doors of all the cabinets, grabbed at the neat piles of quilts and mattresses, and glared at Chinsuk's Mother. But after this predictable venting of envy, she accepted wine and “travel money” and became Chinsuk's Mother's backer. Chinsuk's Mother had been unable to discipline her wayward stepchild, a Korean stepmother's common complaint. The boy's own mother, speaking through the mansin , berated him for his rebellious behavior, then stroked Chinsuk's Mother's arms and thanked her for caring for the children.

When they appear in kut , dead mothers often attempt to reform errant sons. The Im woman in Tranquil Spring had a husband who was a perennial alcoholic. One winter he again took to the bottle. Staggering home late at night, he would beat his wife and loudly abuse her. The Im woman held a kut and her husband's parents appeared in the ancestors' sequence. The husband's mother bent over him, hands on his shoulders, and sobbed, “Oh my son, you must not drink so much. It makes your head ache.” The husband listened, head bowed. The ancestor turned next to her daughter-in-law and, bending over her, wept in sympathy. “You've had nothing but hardship since you came to this house.” A Kim woman was similarly comforted by an ancestral mother-in-law who lamented the bitter life that had pushed the Kim woman into a fit of madness. The ancestor begged her son, the Kim woman's husband, “By whatever means possible, however you can, please save her. Then get her something fancy to wear.”",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual19,Ki-je,"Ancestor Worship by the Family Head

While worship of the household gods is the domain of the housewife, ancestor worship devolves upon the family head. From early childhood a first-born male learns that he is responsible for taking care of his parents while they are alive and later, for performing ritual services for them after they die. These acts serve as repayment for parental love and affection. In this manner, ancestors and offspring are considered mutually dependent. Confucianism from the Yi dynasty on put particular emphasis on ancestor worship as the highest form of moral response.

If a family head is a second or younger son he has no ancestor at home. As mentioned already, the eldest son lives with his parents and performs ritual service for them after their death. He performs the rituals not only for his parents but also for the ancestors who were taken care of by his father. If the ritual officiant is the direct lineal descendant of the main family, he performs the ritual services for his parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and great-great-grandparents.

Ritual service for ancestors begins from the mourning period. It is believed that there are three souls ( hon ) and seven spirits ( back ) in a human body. When a man dies, the three souls leave the body but the seven spirits remain in the body in the grave. The seven spirits are composed of two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and one mouth.

After death one soul leaves the body and with three messengers as guides goes to the heavenly god who controls the life of the living. Another soul moves from the body to the small box called hon-back, which contains either a mass of strings or paper. The third soul returns to stay with the body in the grave after the funeral.

The hon-back is made during the process of putting the body into the coffin. It is preserved on a small table side-by-side with the photograph of the deceased person during the mourning period. It is then kept on the altar for two years and finally buried in the grave. In the central part of Korea the altar of the deceased is established on one corner of the wooden floor. In the southern part of the peninsula, it is located in the outside building containing an altar.

A prominent family will make an ancestor tablet to place beside the hon-back . It is made of chestnut wood and takes a fixed form. On the front of the tablet is the name and the title of the deceased. This is written at the grave side during the burial. If there is an ancestor shrine at home, the ancestor tablet is moved from the home altar to the shrine after three months. Each time a ritual service is performed, the ancestor tablet is moved to the ritual table from the shrine. Until the 4th generation of the ritual performer the tablet is kept in the ancestor shrine. Thereafter it is buried in the grave.

Nowadays most people have no ancestor tablet nor ancestor shrine at home. Many were destroyed during the Korean War. In such a case they make a paper tablet for each ritual service and burn it after the ceremony.

Nowadays most people have no ancestor tablet nor ancestor shrine at home. Many were destroyed during the Korean War. In such a case they make a paper tablet for each ritual service and burn it after the ceremony.

The ritual services for ancestors are classified into three: Ki-je, a ritual service at home on commemoration day; ch’a-rae, a ritual service at home on a holiday; and si-je, a ritual service at the grave.

The ritual service on commemoration day is the most important ceremony. It is performed at midnight on the commemoration day on the wooden floor area or in the inner room by the direct lineal descendant. Theoretically, only one ancestor receives the ritual service, but a dead couple tend to be served side-by-side.

During the preceding several days the worshipper and his wife exert themselves to the utmost spiritually. There are two kinds of exertion or meditation; inside and outside exertion. One should concentrate his soul and mind, thinking only of the good behavior of the ancestor. This is “inside” meditation. At the same time, one should not leave the home and should not drink wine and sleep with one’s wife. This is “outside” meditation.

The food for the ritual is carefully prepared by the housewife. The special table and vessels for the ritual service are preserved separately from those used daily, even in a normal house.

It is said that “different families have different rites” because the performance of a ritual service is a special family practice. But there are some standardized arrangements of the ritual table and process of ritual performance. For the ritual table, for example, everyone knows the words such as “red on the east and white on the west”, meaning that red-colored fruits are placed on the east side of the ritual table and the white on the west. Similar expressions say, “fish on the east and meat on the west”, and, “dry meat on the left and sweet drinking on the right”. Viewed from the performer’s side, the first line is for dishes of fruits, the next for vegetables, the next for different thick soups, then that for different kinds of meat and fishes, and the last for bowls of rice and soup. Spoons and chopsticks are placed on the left side of rice bowl because a dead spirit is considered to be left-handed. There are rules governing the height of fruit and meat offerings and the number of thick soups are kept in with the official rank of the ancestor and the status of the family.

In front of a large ceremonial table there is a small table on which incense is burned. On the floor is placed a small cup containing a small bundle of straw or pine needles put on sand or rice.

The direct lineal descendant, the master of ritual service, sits in front of the small table and burns the incense, which indicates the beginning of the service. He stands up a little behind the table, bowing deeply twice and then sits down again. He takes a glass of wine and pours the wine three times into the small bowls of sand or rice, which symbolize the meeting of heaven and earth or the descent of the ancestor spirit to the table. Everybody bows twice to the ancestor. The ritual master dedicates the first wine glass, after rotating it three times in the smoke of the incense. The dedication of the first wine glass is the most important right of the direct lineal descendent. A helper removes the cover of the rice bowl and puts the spoon and chopsticks on an empty bowl. All participants bow deeply twice. Next, a sentence is read in a loud voice paying respectful and affectionate tribute to the memory of the deceased ancestor.

The second glass of wine is dedicated by the wife of the ritual master or by the second son of the ancestor. The action of the second is just the same as the first. After the dedication of the third glass by a relative of the third category, the spoon is placed on the rice bowl. Then follows the ancestor’s mealtime. A folding screen can be set between the table and ritual performers, or they leave the room for a short while. Thereafter, the folding screen is removed or the participants return to the room. The wife brings a bowl of water which is put on the table in place of the soup. All the participants bow deeply twice and then the ritual master announces the end of the service. The participants take a little of the food from the table or a glass of wine, to share the meal with the deceased ancestor.

There are some noteworthy aspects to this ritual service. A peach cannot be used as a fruit on the ritual table; the spirit is considered left-handed; and the ancestor is served with wine whether he or she drank or not during life. The most important aspect of the ritual service is the sharing of food with the ancestor.

Another ritual service which is performed at home is that of annual festivals. In general, nowadays, it is held twice a year, on New Year’s Day and in mid August, by lunar calender. Some families add one other day, “cold food day”, in spring. If one more day, “beginning of winter”, is added, four such annual festivals can be held.

In general, the services of annual feasts are the same as for the commemoration service, but they differ slightly in the kinds of foods utilized. Seasonal special cooking instead of rice and soup is dedicated. Further the annual feast is held in the morning whereas the commemoration is performed at midnight.

The ritual service on commemoration day and the annual festivals are performed for all ancestors whose tablets are kept at home. There are different numbers of ancestors at home according to the status of the family head. There is no ritual service for ancestors in the newly established branch family. But in the house of direct lineal descendant there are generally ancestors of four generations. If he performs 4 couples of ancestors and 2 ritual services on annual festivals, there is a total of 10 ritual services per year at the house of a direct lineal descendant.

When the direct lineal descendant reaches the fifth generation, the ancestor tablet should be given to the branch lineal descendant, who is, theoretically, still in the fourth generation. But most ancestor tablets are kept by the direct lineal descendant and buried in the grave of the ancestor. This is called “mae-hwan” (lit. “returning by interment”). Thereafter the ritual service is held once in a year in the graveyard. This is the reason for the formation of the lineage organization ( mun-jung ).

In the ritual services of ancestor worship there are two kinds of ancestors; the ancestors who receive commemoration day service at home, and those who receive the ritual service at the grave. If the ritual service of ancestor worship is not performed the ancestor spirit becomes a wandering ghost, but has no power to punish the descendants directly. However, it is nevertheless believed that the ritual service for ancestors protects the offspring from the evil effects of malevolent ghosts and helps to ensure the material prosperity and health of the living family members.

Among the ancestors there is hierarchical order according to the generation principle during the ritual service. For example, during the performance of ritual service on a holiday the first glass of wine is dedicated to the great-grandfather among the four generations of ancestors. But a more recent ancestor is more intimately regarded than is a remoter one.

Ancestor worship reflects the concept of future life, as Janelli [1973] showed. He observed that a retired man is served three meals a day by his offspring, during mourning period he receives one meal a day, during four generations he is served four times a year, and after that he receives it one time a year. In this context death is considered only a stage in a continuity of life. That is why the ancestor worship is developed so fully in Korean society. The ancestor spirits live with their offspring in this world after death, but slowly fade away with the passage of time.

Ritual20,Funerary proceedings,"“ Mourning and Burial Rites . --These were collected and arranged by one of the ministers of the present dynasty Yi Youl Kok by name. They were put forth in the order given below, and the ceremonies are supposed to be observed in all houses where there has been a death. As a matter of fact, however, the poorer classes cannot afford all that the ceremonial demands, and a number of the minor items are omitted. The period of mourning, the dress of the mourner, and the sacrifices offered are all strictly carried out as below if possible. A man will sell his furniture or his house rather than neglect to offer sacrifices.”

Rules for wearing mourning of various grades . There are eight grades of mourning for adults, viz.:--
I. Cham Choi .

II. Chai Choi worn for three years.

III. "" "" "" "" one year.

IV. "" "" "" "" five months.

V. "" "" "" "" three months.

VI. Tai Kong

VII. Syo Kong .

VIII. Si Ma. ”


I. Mourning Clothes . Cham Choi . --This is the deepest class of mourning. In this the garments are made of very coarse hempen cloth and unhemmed. The upper garments are called Choi, and the under garments are called Chi Ma. Hanging down in front from the shoulder is a piece of cloth, which is supposed to catch the tears as they fall. Behind is a wide piece of cloth hanging down from the collar to which it is attached; this is called the Pou Pau. It has a figurative meaning, and that is that the mourner trails his sad heart after him in the dust. On either side also are pieces hanging down from the arm-pits. These are called Pyeng Yeng. These indicate the sad heart of a filial child which should be downcast. Again Choi means that the heart is rent and torn, and Pou Pau that he is over come with sadness. On the shoulder is a binding which is called Chyek, and which signifies that the filial son carries the thoughts of his parents always with him. On the left side covering the heart is also a piece of cloth which is fastened to the collar. It is worn for three years (in reality only twenty-seven months).

1. For one's father.

2. If a father has died before the paternal grandfather, when the latter dies, the first-born grandson wears it.

3. If father and grandfather die before the great-grandfather, when the latter dies the same rule is followed as in No. 2.

4. The father wears it for his first-born son. This is because of the break in the family line.

5. The wife wears if for her husband's father. As her husband wears it she must follow the example of her lord and master.

6. A wife wears it for her husband.

7. A concubine wears it for her lord.

8. A concubine wears if for her lord's father.”

“II. Chai Choi .--This differs very little from Cham choi , save that the garments are hemmed. It is also worn for three years.

1. For a mother.

2. A concubine's son for his own mother if there are no children by the lawful wife.

3. If the father is dead the first-born grandson wears if for his grandmother.

4. If the father and grandfather are both dead, the first-born grandson wears it for his great-grandmother.

5. For a step-mother.

6. A concubine's son, if his mother is dead, wears if for other concubines of his father. 343

7. For parents by adoption.

8. A woman wears if for her husband's mother.

9. A woman wears if for her husband's step-mother.

10. A mother for her first-born son (this is almost the only case in which a woman does not wear the same mourning as her husband).

11. A woman for her eldest stepson.

12. A concubine for her lord's mother.”

“III, IV, V. Chai Choi is also worn for one year, five months, and three months for more distant relatives according to kinship. The mourning garments are the same as when worn for three years but no staff is used.

VI. Tai Kong . --This is not deep mourning, and is only worn for nine months. The garments are like those of Chai Choi but of a finer texture.

1. For the sons of a father's brethren.

2. For grandchildren.

3. For son's wifes excepting the first-born.

4. For wives of brother's sons.

5. A woman for her husband's grand-parents or great-grandparents.

6. A woman for her husband's paternal uncles and their wives.

7. A woman for her husband's brothers' sons and their wives.

8. A woman for her husband's parents by birth. (If he has been adopted into another family.)

9. A woman for her first-born grandson.

VII. Syo Kong. --This is only worn for five months.

VIII. Si Ma for three months. The garments are in both cases like the preceding, but of still finer texture, and they are worn for still more distant relatives. Si Ma is also worn for intimate friends.”

“ Mourning for Children . --For children the mourning is always one degree less than for adults. Mourning for children is divided into three classes.

First class. When the child is from sixteen to nineteen years old.

Second class. When the child is from twelve to fifteen years old.

Third class. When the child is from eight to eleven years old.

Under eight years of age no mourning is worn. For an infant under three months there is not even wailing.

If a boy or a girl has been betrothed, no matter what the age is, mourning is worn the same as for an adult. The grades are:--

Tai Kong , worn nine months for first class; seven months for second class.

Syo Kong , worn five months for first, second, and third class.

Si Ma , worn three months for first, second and third class.”

“The grade and duration of mourning are determined by kinship.

Both a man who has been adopted into another family, and a woman who is married, wear for their parents by birth one degree of mourning less than they ordinarily would, and the same rule applies to the parents when their children die. If a wife, however, has been divorced she wears full mourning for her own parents. A divorced wife wears no mourning for her former husband's relatives.

The rules for mourning in the case of a concubine are the same as those of a legitimate wife. Besides the above there is another kind of mourning termed.”

“ Sim Sang . --This is best translated as secret mourning, or literally mourning in one's heart. The man or woman is a mourner, but no mourning apparel is worn. This is done for three years.

For example, if the mother dies during the father's lifetime, no mourning clothes are worn out of regard for the father. The same rule applies to a step-mother and in other similar cases. It is also followed for a teacher or friend for shorter periods.

In the case of high officials (who cannot be in office while they are in mourning) their period of mourning is sometimes lessened by royal decree. In this case one year's mourning is only worn for thirty days.

Nine months' mourning for twenty days.

Five months' mourning for fifteen days.

Three months' mourning for seven days.

Mourning for maternal grandparents, fifteen days.

Mourning for parents-in-law, twenty-three days.”

“When a person is at the point of death, he is removed to the lower part of the room, and the inmates of the household quietly sit around. New cotton is placed over the mouth and nostrils, in order to prevent the spirit from escaping. If the dying person is a man, all the male members of the household grasp his hand, and the entire family, male and female, wail together. If the dying person is a female, the female members of the household grasp her hand, while the entire family wails. The corpse is then covered with a blanket, the entire family still wailing loudly.

A member or servant of the family then takes the recently worn holiday clothes of the deceased and ascends to the house-top. He faces the north (because the north is the region of darkness, and the abode of the shades), and seizing the collar of the garment in his left hand, and the belt in his right, he shakes it and calls loudly the name of the deceased three times. If the deceased is an official, his surname and official title are called. If he is not an official, only his surname and clan title. He then descends, folds up the clothes and lays them on the corpse. The man's name is called and the clothes shaken, thinking that the spirit may be induced to return. A temporary tablet is then made which is put in the folded clothing. At the time when the corpse is interred, these two are buried together.”

“The chief mourner and his wife take the leading parts in all the ceremonies following. The chief mourner is always the first-born son, or if the first-born son is dead, his first-born son acts, no matter what his age may be.

One of the relatives acts as master of ceremonies, another acts as secretary (for writing notices of death, & c., and sending to friends of the chief mourner), and still another as master of sacrifices.

Immediately after a person's death the chief mourner changes his clothing and must not partake of solid food for some days. He unties his hair and wails. His sons also with their wives untie their hair. The immediate members of the family and servants do the same. None of them dare wear shoes, but go about in their socks only. However, adopted sons or married daughters need not go as far as this.”

“The coffin is then prepared and the following articles are needed.

Fir tree resin, ten ounces; yellow wax, three ounces; to fill in the chinks of the coffin.

Varnish to cover the coffin. --If the family are poor and cannot afford varnish, ink may be used.

Black silk and paper to cover over all the cracks in the coffin.

Green or red silk to put in the four corners.

A board on which is made a diagram of the seven principal stars in the constellation Ursus Major. This board is covered with black silk. (The spirit deity which inhabits the ‘seven stars,’ is supposed to confer longevity.)”

“In encoffining the body the following articles are needed:--A curtain and screen; a low bed or couch. If there is no bed one of the doors of another room, or the gate of the yard can be used; a mat; a pillow; a coverlet or blanket.

The curtains and screen are so placed as to exclude the least draught of air. Then the mat is spread out on the bed. On this the corpse is placed with his head to the south and covered. Preparations are then made for bathing the body, for which purpose the following articles are needed; two basins; perfumed water; two bathing towels for the head--one for the face and one for the hair. These are made of hempen cloth. Two bathing towels for the body--one for the upper, and one for the lower extremities. These are also made of hempen cloth. A comb and comb case; a hair ribbon of black silk; five purses, one for the nail parings of each hand and foot, and one for the hair which comes out in combing. (After the body has been bathed, the comb, towels, bathing water, and the pieces of wood or horn, which were placed between the teeth to prevent them from closing tightly, are buried.)

A belt. --If the man has been an official it is made of scarlet material. If he had not been an official it is made of indigo blue material. The material must be of silk and rather wide. For a woman it is made of scarlet silk.

Outer garments either the long sleeved holiday garments, or those garments which are worn by philosophers; a long wadded jacket; an undervest of silk with sleeves so long that they cover the hands; a suit of clothes of a single thickness; wadded trousers; wadded socks; head band; cap; pieces of silk to cover the face; pieces of cotton rolled up in the form of dates to stop up the ears; gloves made of red silk inside, and black silk outside; shoes made of black silk; rice, about a spoonful; pieces of Haliotis shell; three pearls; a spoon made of willow wood which is used for putting the rice into the mouth; a piece of hempen cloth two yards square to cover the face; a basin and towel used by the mourner to wash his hands.”

“In bathing the body the master of ceremonies will pour out the perfumed water into a basin, while the chief mourner retires outside the screen and wails. The master of ceremonies will then strip the body of its clothes. The hair will then be bathed and dried, and bound up into a top knot. The body will then be bathed and dried, and the nails pared. The body will then be covered by a blanket, while the master of ceremonies spreads out the clothing which is to be worn by the deceased. If the deceased had himself been a mourner, only white clothing is worn by him, and before burial no meats must be offered in sacrifice. This is because mourners must abstain from meat.”

“Materials needed for sacrifices to be now offered:-- a high desk on which the tablet is placed; dried meat; prepared rice (this is prepared in a special manner and sweetened); wine; wine cups; candles.

The above things are then arranged in proper order on the sacrificial table. The chief mourner then washes his hands and goes to the west of the sacrificial offerings and pours out wine. The chief mourner and the rest of the family will then wail. The chief mourner will then go to the north of the table holding the sacrifices and will be seated. The women of the household will sit to the west of the table. They must all be seated on very coarse straw mats. Those relatives, however, who do not wear Cham Choi or Chai Choi can sit on ordinary mats.”

“The chief mourner wailing loudly will bare his left shoulder. He will then wash his hands. The master of ceremonies will remove the pillow. The chief mourner will go toward the left around to the west side, and facing the east will uncover the face. He will then with the willow spoon place a little rice in the right side of the mouth. After this he will place a pearl in on the same side. The same process will then be gone through in the centre of the mouth. Afterwards again on the left side of the mouth. The chief mourner will again cover his shoulder and return to his straw mat. The master of ceremonies will then replace the pillow and entirely discard the cloth which covered the face. The head band of black silk will then be put on and the cap adjusted. The ears will now be stopped up and the face covered with another cloth. The shoes will now be put on followed by the remaining clothes, the belt and gloves in order. Then the body is covered by a coverlet. The three years' mourner must sleep beside the deceased. The one year mourner must sleep opposite the corpse. The other relatives can return to their homes.”

“For the sacrifices now offered are needed:--A high table for the tablet; bed and coverlet; clothes; table for the viands; brazier for incense; incense basin; food and wine; fruit; white grass cloth 3 or 4 yards; paper case for the tablet; flags made of red silk; face powder; pencil; glue made from deer horns; bamboo poles for flags.

All the above are gotten ready and the tablet placed on the desk. The bed is then spread out, and on this the clothes are put, and on top of these the tablet. In front of this the viands are arranged and incense burned and libations poured. (This must be done regularly just as if the man was alive and partook of the food. Basins with water and towels are placed every morning before the tablet.)

The flags are then fastened to the bamboo poles and set up on the right side.

If the deceased is an official his surname and title are written. If there is no title only the surname and clan. For a woman her husband's title is used, otherwise only her husband's surname.”

“The wrapping up of the corpse. White hempen cloth 20 yards; two coverlets. The old clothes of the deceased which are put into the coffin. Cotton; a piece of hempen cloth on which the body is laid as on a mat.

Libations of wine are first poured. The mourner can now tie up his hair which until now was hanging loose.

The master of ceremonies now wraps the corpse in the hempen cloth. The cloth is first wrapped transversely and then longitudinally. After this the upper clothes are put on. These must be put on upside down, or transversely, or any way excepting the right way. After this the mourner can put on his cap and belt.”

“The master of ceremonies now washes his hands and removes the corpse to a table or bed. The pillow is laid aside, and silken cloth is folded and wrapped around the head. The ends are folded and made to cover the shoulders. All the vacant space between the two legs is now filled with old clothes of the deceased. If there are not sufficient old clothes to fill up the vacant space cotton is used. The clothes which are now put on the top are all tied on the left side. (Ordinarily clothes are tied on the right side.) The ends must be carefully folded up. The coverlet is then wrapped around the corpse.

The face, however, is not yet covered, as the family may still wish to see their dead relative. The chief mourner and his wife then beat their heads on the ground and wail. The chief mourner must face the west, and his wife the east. If it is Cham Choi the chief mourner will again loosen his hair and bare his shoulder. But in any other degree of mourning this is not done.”

“After the operations of dressing have been completed, the relatives all take their proper places standing. The sacrificial meats and auxiliaries will now be brought in. The master of ceremonies will superintend. He will wash his hands and arrange the sacrificial offerings in proper order before the desk containing the tablet. Incense will be lit and libations poured. All the mourners (excepting the chief mourner) will prostrate themselves twice. The master of ceremonies will then cover the offerings with a cloth. The chief mourner and the members of his household, including servants and slaves, will then wail without ceasing.

The final preparations for coffining. The following are required:--Ashes made from rice husks, four or five quarts; thick white paper five or six sheets; mattress for putting inside the coffin; mat; pillow; white hempen cloth 20 yards; two coverlets. (Those which have been used before for covering the corpse may be used.) A suit of holiday clothes; oiled paper to wrap round the boards; fine cord 50 arms' length; thick cord 10 arms' lengths; three boards. (A small house may be temporarily built outside in which the coffin is placed until interment; or one of the rooms may be fitted up as a place in which to put the coffin.) Two low trestles on which the coffin is placed; a curtain; a covering for the coffin of silk or other material.”

“The final preparations for coffining are gone through on the day following the wrapping up of the corpse. The master of ceremonies spreads out the mattress, pillow and coverlet. (It should be noted that in these ceremonies all is done that would be done if the man was alive. The wash basin and towel, the comb and the bed all prepared.) The servants then bring in the coffin and place it in the middle of the room. The master of ceremonies will now spread out the ashes evenly on the floor of the coffin. (This is for the absorption of the juices of the body.) On the ashes are put the thick white paper and on this the 7 star board. On this the silk mattress is laid, and the pillow put in position. Then the wrappings for the body with the ends hanging over the side of the coffin, and after this the coverlet in which the body is wrapped. Finally, a suit of official robes are put in.

Then the master of ceremonies and the sons of the deceased will together raise the body and place it in the coffin. The body will now be wrapped up, beginning with the feet. After the feet, the head is wrapped up, then the coverings on the left side are folded in, and lastly the coverings on the right side. Then the purses with the nail parings will be put one in each corner of the coffin, and the purse with the loose hair will also be put into the coffin. If there are any vacant spaces remaining these are filled in with the clothes of the deceased. Lastly, the sild covering is placed over all.”

“The chief mourner and his wife will then wail loudly. The wife will then retire to her own apartments, and the servants will then put on the coffin lid and nail it down. The coffin will then be removed to the room which was occupied by the deceased when alive. Flags will be raised on each side of the room and sacrifices will again be offered. Then all will again wail.

The master of ceremonies will then wash his hands and pour out libations. Incense will also be burned. All will then wail, and with the exception of the chief mourner will prostrate themselves twice.

The relatives can now all return to their homes, and from this time the servants will cease mourning. Any hired mourners will cease also from this time.”

“The mourner will then get ready his own proper mourning clothes, hat and staff. staff for Cham choi of bamboo, for Chai choi of eleococcus wood.)

The day following this, all the five grades of mourners will put on their appropriate apparel, and entering the room where the coffin is placed, each will take his proper place. The chief mourner will enter before breakfast and wail. (During the times the deceased usually partook of food the mourner will enter and wail. This shall be done until burial takes place.) From this day on the chief mourner and his brethren can partake of gruel (before this they were only supposed to partake of congee or rice water).”

“Every morning before daybreak the chief mourner will enter the apartment where the coffin is placed and wail. At the time when the deceased usually arose, the master of ceremonies will take in a basin of water, towels and the materials for dressing the hair, which shall be offered to the spirit.

The master of ceremonies will then place the tablet on the desk and take off the coverings. Vegetables, fruit, dried and raw meats will then be offered. The master of ceremonies will then wash his hands and pour out the wine, during which time the chief mourner wails loudly.

During the time when food is offered, morning and evening after the libations are poured, the spoon will be placed in the bowl of rice on the right side (because the man is supposed to take the spoon in his right hand). The chopsticks will be placed in position. The chief mourner then prostrates himself twice and wails. He will then rise and leaning on his staff will wail. This ceremony is gone through regularly every morning and evening until interment.

At the time when the deceased usually retired, the chief mourner will again enter and wail. During the day the chief mourner must wail incessantly.”

“Before interment, sacrifices are offered to the spirits of the hill where the grave is to be, and there is needed seven stakes to mark boundaries; a superintendent of sacrifices; an attendant (these two are chosen from amongst the relatives of the deceased); two mats (one on which the table of offerings is placed, and one on which the relatives prostrate themselves); sacrificial wines and meats; incense and burner; a prayer table.

On the day appointed, the master of sacrifices will proceed to the place with the chief mourner to take up the sod. The chief mourner will be wailing all the while. The attendant and geomancer will then put in the stakes one at each corner of the grave, one at the head, one in the centre, and one at the foot. The master of sacrifices will then proceed with the attendant to the center stake and will spread out the offerings. They will face the south and pour out the libations. They will then face the hill (the attendant behind the master of sacrifices) and prostrate themselves twice. Then washing their hands, they will light the incense and pour out libations on the earth. They will again prostrate themselves twice and again pour out libations, this time to the spirits of the grave. The master of sacrifices will then go to the left, and facing the east will recite the following prayer: ‘--(year)--(month)--(day)--(cyclical day)--(name of master of sacrifices) begs the spirits of the hill that they may aid and assist--(name of deceased) who is to have his final resting-place here. Therefore pure wine and fruits are reverently offered.’ He will then prostrate himself twice and the offerings will be removed. The chief mourner will then announce to the spirits that preparations for burial will be made, and will prostrate himself twice, wailing all the while.”

“If the burial place is the ancestral burial ground, a few libations of wine are poured to the spirits of the other graves and offerings of fruit are made.

The grave is then dug. At the bottom of the grave is a smaller cavity. This is filled with lime and water. If the family can afford it oil is used instead of water. This makes a hard cement and is intended to keep out worms. The mixture consists of 2 parts unslaked lime with 1 part of yellow earth the whole mixed with sufficient water or oil.

For the procession to the grave there is needed: a hearse; four fans (on two of which clouds are painted and on two are painted a phoenix); one piece each of black and red silk as a present to the spirits of the hill; a blank tablet with writing materials; a small house and case for the tablet; a mat or cushion on which the tablet rests; 15 yards hempen cloth for the bottom of the grave beneath the coffin; pine boards to cover the coffin; a cloth towel 3 yards long which is carried on the end of a pole; four lanterns, two to be carried in front and two behind; a small sedan chair in which the spirit rides to the grave; sacrificial desk; table for offerings; a shade to screen off the sun's rays from the hearse; mat; a screen.”

“In the morning of the day before the interment, food is offered as usual, incense is rned, and libations poured. Then the attendant will place the tablet on the desk and uits will be again offered and libations poured; the master of sacrifices will then kneel[unknown] d announce to the spirit that on a ‘fortunate day is is proposed to remove the coffin.’[unknown] e chief mourner then wails loudly. The coffin is then taken to the ancestral tem[unavailable] to bid farewell to the spirits of the ancestors. (This was the ancient custom, but at resent the tablets and flags are taken instead of the coffin.) When the door of the ances[unknown] al temple is reached sacrifices are again offered while the chief mourner wails loudly.”

“On the evening before the interment, food is offered as usual. Afterwards the attendant washes his hands, and taking wine from the hands of the chief mourner, offers it up; then incense is lit, and it is announced to the spirit that, ‘the proprieties of the final and everlasting removal will admit of no delay, therefore it is proposed to remove the coffin to its carriage, thus carrying out the instructions left by the ancients.’ Then the chief mourner prostrates himself twi[unavailable]e and wails loudly.

The next day, before the coffin is placed on the hearse, the attendant removes all the sacrificial vessels, and facing the north says, ‘We now presume to announce that the coffin will be placed in the hearse, and we will depart.’ After the coffin is placed in the hearse, sacrifices are offered facing the south.

The attendant will then take the prayer-desk and tablet, and proceed to the street in front of the house, where sacrifices are again offered, and libations poured. Incense will also be lit, and the following announcement is made by the master of sacrifices: ‘The spirit in its car and the coffin in the hearse will now proceed to its peaceful home; we, thus completing the everlasting proprieties, and bidding it until Heaven ends, a last farewell.’ The attendant will then put the tablet in the small carriage reserved for it, and precede the hearse in going to the grave.”

“On reaching the place of burial, sacrifices are again offered in front of the coffin. The desk is placed in position. On the south side of the grave the attendant will spread out a mat. The coffin will be placed on this with its head to the north, and the chief mourner going to the east will bow down and wail.

The coffin will now be lowered into the grave carefully, quietly, and evenly. During this time the mourners must not wail. The coffin is then covered with a mattress, and over this the flags are spread out straight and evenly, and again on top of this the four fans. (At present the fans are sometimes dispensed with, drawings being made on the coffin lid instead.) In the grave are then placed the pieces of red and black silk which are a present to the spirits of the hills. Then all the mourners will prostrate themselves and while prostrate will wail. Pine wood boards are then placed on the coffin, and on the boards, paper. The grave is then filled in with a mixture of earth and lime, the whole being stamped in firmly. Then sacrifices are again offered, and the tablet is taken back to the house.”

“ The sacrifices to the spirits of the hill and grave. --A small space of ground is leveled and at the head is put a small tablet inscribed, ‘The spirits of the ground.’ The offerings are arranged and libations are poured. Then the master of sacrifices faces the tablet with the attendant behind him. They both prostrate themselves twice. Then the master of sacrifices washes his hands, lights the incense, and kneeling, pours out libations on the ground. The attendant again fills the cups and places them in front of the tablet. They then go to the left, and, facing the east, the master of sacrifices says: ‘--(year) --(month)--(day)-- (name of master of sacrifices), presumes to assist in making the spirits of the earth glorious-- (name of deceased) is being buried here. Will you aid and watch over this grave so that in the hereafter no difficulties will arise. We reverently offer wine and fruits and meats to you.’ They then again prostrate themselves twice.”

“ The permanent tablet. -- The tablet is made of chestnut wood, and covered over with a powder, which is obtained from the inside of the seeds of the mirabilis dichotoma , mixed with glue made from deer horns. There are really two tablets.

The master of sacrifices then says, ‘-- (year) -- (month -- (day) -- (cyclical name of day) the lonely one -- (name of chief mourner), wishes to reflect the brightness of the District Lord (the deceased) who has come from the shadow of the grave to the tablet, wilt thou now come from the old residence and thy spirit lean for dependence in the new tablet.’

The attendant then places the tablet on the desk and arranges the offerings. Writing materials are also placed on the desk. The master of sacrifices then washes his hands, and a good penman then writes on the back tablet first, ‘--official title -- (surname Kong ([unavailable] ) -- (personal name) --'s (name called by friends) tablet.’ (It must be remembered that a man's personal name is not called by anyone in the owner's presence, but he is always called by a substitute or nick-name. The tablet placed in front has then written on it the following:-- ‘The tablet of the Manifested Father and Lord of the village.’ Below and to one side is written ‘-- (name of chief mourner) a filial son offers sacrifices.’ When all is written, offerings are made. Then the new tablet is removed to the desk. The old tablet on its desk is then placed behind the new one, and the attendant burns incense and pours out libations. The chief mourner kneels opposite the tablets. The master of sacrifices kneels to the right and recites the above for the spirit to leave the old tablet for the new. The chief mourner then wails. During the entire time of mourning from this time forth there is a special room set apart for the residence of the tablet and desk and for the sacrifices. The chief mourner and his assistants can now return to their own rooms. The old tablet is then taken and buried in front of the grave.

“From this time a one year's mourner may eat meat and drink wine, but these are not allowed a three years' mourner.

Sacrifices after Interment.
First sacrifices on the day of burial.
Second sacrifices on the ‘Yih,’ ‘Ting,’ ‘Ki,’ ‘Sui,’ and ‘Kwei’ days, following the first sacrifices.
Third sacrifices on the ‘Kia,’ ‘Ping,’ ‘Wuh,’ ‘Keng,’ and ‘Jen’ days following the second sacrifices.
The cessation of wailing sacrifices on the ‘Kia,’ ‘Ping,’ ‘Wu,’ ‘Keng,’ and ‘Jen’ days following the third sacrifices.
The sacrifices offered to all the ancestors on the day following the cessation of wailing sacrifices.
The sacrifices of small luck on the first anniversary of the death.
The sacrifices of great luck on the second anniversary of the death.
The final mourning sacrifices, three months after the last.”

“ The first sacrifices . --A white earthenware or brassware basin of clean sand is obtained, in which a plant of Imperata Arundinacoea is planted. The master of sacrifices then recites the following ‘--(year) -- (month) -- (day) -- (cyclical name of day) the lonely one -- (name of chief mourner) presumes to make clear and manifest -- (name of deceased). The days and months do not tarry.’

The master of sacrifices will then open the case which contains the tablet and remove the tablet to the desk. Then the chief mourner who remains outside will lean on his staff and wail. Then all the relatives enter and take their proper places in front of the tablet, the chief mourner being nearest the tablet, and all the relatives arranged in the order of their nearness of relationship to the deceased. They all wail.

The chief mourner then ceases, wailing, washes his hands, kneels, burns incense and prostrates himself twice. The attendant then pours wine into the cup and hands it to the chief mourner, who with one cup wine pours thrice on the sand in the dish. (The spirit is supposed to know the wine by its odour and descend.) He then returns the wine cup to the attendant, and prostrating himself twice returns to his but outside and wails.

The sacrifices are then offered.”

“In the first libations the mourner will kneel opposite the censer. The attendant will then take empty cups and pour wine therein, and kneeling will hand it to the mourner, who will pour thrice on the sand, and will then return the cups to the attendant, who will refill them and place them before the tablet. The chief mourner will then retire a little back and the master of ceremonies will then kneel and recite the above prayer for the descent of the spirit. During this time the mourner ceases wailing. After all is finished he will wail and all present will prostrate themselves twice. The mourner will then retire to his hut, and leaning on his staff will wail.

In the second libation, the wife of the chief mourner or the nearest relative after the chief mourner will go through the same ceremonies excepting that as they have no hut to retire to, they go to their own rooms. The third libation is poured by either the son or nephew of the chief mourner, who goes through precisely the same ceremonies.”

“In the offerings of food, first a little wine is offered and the spoon and chopsticks placed in position, also a pipe and tobacco. Then all will leave the room, closing the doors and keeping as quiet as possible. They remain outside for a time which is sufficient for eating. Then the chief mourner enters and wails. The attendant will then remove the soup dish and place a few spoonfuls of rice in the congee. Then the dishes are all covered and the master of the ceremonies says: ‘The ceremonies have been completed.’ The tablet is then removed to its case. The mourner wails, prostrates himself, and announces his departure. The food is now removed. In all the other sacrifices the ceremonies are the same as the above.”

“ The Cessation of Wailing Sacrifices. --In these water is substituted for wine as a reminder of ancient times when there was no wine.

The Sacrifices of Small Luck. --Until this time the mourners' clothing has not been washed. For this sacrifice, clean clothing is put on, and the belt is changed for one of finer texture. After this sacrifice the morning and evening wailings cease, and wailing is only done at stated times. Until this time the chief mourner was supposed to abstain from fruit and vegetables, his diet only consisting of the meanest fare. But from now on he can partake of fruit or vegetables.

The Great Luck Sacrifices. --The chief mourner now discards his large mourner's hat, his white shoes, and his hempen belt and clothes. Instead, he wears an ordinary hat as other men do, only white instead of black, and plain white clothing. After the ceremonies are completed, the chief mourner takes the tablet and places it in the ancestral temple. On the way to the ancestral temple he wails without ceasing until he arrives opposite the door, when he ceases. The room which was formerly occupied by the tablet and in which sacrifices were offered, is now emptied of the mourning and sacrificial accessories, and these with the mourner's clothing are burned.”

“ The Final Mourning Sacrifices. --After this a black hat and black belt are worn instead of the white clothing. It is performed in an ante-chamber in the ancestral temple where the tablet has been temporarily removed. Until this time the chief mourner could not partake of either wine or meat. But after this sacrifice he can partake of any food he chooses.

In the ancestral temple, sacrifices are only offered to four generations of ancestors. On the day following the last sacrifices the announcement is made in the ancestral temple of the entrance of the new tablet.”

“As a new pair of tablets have been added, the oldest pair of tablets must be buried. Before steps are taken for doing this the following announcement is made--

‘To our ancestor of the fifth degree-- (name and title) we now announce with sorrow which overcomes us, that the time for mourning for our father is now completed, the proprieties demand that thy tablet be removed, and although we do it against our will, yet the proprieties demand that sacrifices be offered to four generations only, and therefore we will remove thy tablet and inter it. We being overcome with sorrow, offer wine fruits, and meats, and with a hundred prostrations bid thee farewell. Wilt thou deign to accept our offerings?’

On the addition of the new tablet the following announcement is made to the tablets in the ancestral temple--

‘-- (year) -- (month) -- (day) -- (name of sacrifices) although we have committed sins worthy of death, yet we have not died, but our father having died in our stead, we have completed the three years’ mourning. The proprieties dare not be altered, therefore we change the grades of the tablets. We offer wines and fruits, and meats. Will you deign to accept them?’

To the new tablet the following announcement is made: ‘We --(name, title, &c.) wishing to reflect our father's glory, and although we would mourn yet longer, the prpprieties place a 357 limit to the time of mourning, and in accordance with these proprieties, we are compelled to place the tablet in the ancestral temple. Therefore with reverence we offer wines and meats and fruits. Will you deign to accept them?’”

“ The removal of the body to another grave. --First a new site for a grave is chosen. Then a new coffin is made, and clothing and blankets prepared as in the first instance. Si Ma mourning is worn on this occasion. The spirits of the hill where the new grave is situated are then appeased by offerings, and the following announcement is made:

‘-- (year) -- (month) -- (day) -- (name of the person offering sacrifices) wishing to make glorious the shades of his ancestor -- (name of deceased), and the grave not being peaceful or fortunate, it is proposed to remove it to this place; will you spirits of this grave assist us, so as to avoid any difficulties in this great undertaking. We therefore respectfully offer you pure wine and fruits.’”

“The grave is then dug as in the first instance. The chief mourner then goes to the ancestral temple on the day before the removal of the grave, and offers sacrifices for the descent of the spirit as in the three sacrifices, and prostrating himself twice makes the following announcement:

‘-- (year) -- (month) -- (day) -- the filial son -- (name of mourner) announces that the grave of -- (name of deceased) not being peaceful, and fearing that calamities may befall the family on that account, proposes to remove the grave on-- (day) of -- (month). Thy spirit must not be disturbed or frightened by the noise and shaking. We therefore make this announcement.’

The chief mourner will then prostrate himself and retire. While the servants are digging for the new grave, he dons his mourning garments and wails.

At the old grave sacrifices are offered, and an announcement made to the spirits.”

“When the remains are dug up, sacrifices are again offered, and the following is recited:

‘-- (year) -- (month) -- (day) the ceremonies of interment were completed, but the grave has not been peaceful. We now propose to give the spirit peace by again performing the ceremonies. With prostrations we beg you not to be frightened.’

The remains are then dug up, and removed to a place set apart for their reception, and for the ceremonies attending the offering up of sacrifices. As the remains are removed from the grave, they are carefully cleansed and placed in the new coffin with the same ceremonies as at the first interment. Sacrifices are offered as well. The coffin is then removed to the new grave with the same ceremonies as before.”

“ Sacrifices to the spirits of the new grave . --The attendant places all the offerings in proper order in front of the grave, and after washing his hands, will kneel, light incense and prostrating himself twice, will invite the spirits to come and partake of the offerings. He will pour libations on the ground, and refilling the cups will say:

‘--(year) -- (month) -- (day) -- (name of person offering sacrifices) wishing to reflect the glory of the spirits and making the grave of -- (name of deceased) here, begs you to aid him, and through him aid us, causing all difficulties to disappear. We therefore offer wine and fruits. Will you deign to accept them?’

The attendant and master of sacrifices will then both prostrate themselves twice.

Scarifices will then be offered to the spirit of the deceased. The mourners will all go to the place set apart for offering sacrifices, and taking their proper places will wail. They will then kneel and the master of sacrifices will say:

‘--(year) -- (month) -- (day) the filial son -- (name of chief mourner) proposes to again perform the ceremonies of interment and begs the spirit not to be firghtened or startled. Since the first ceremonies have been performed he has had no peace, and therefore overcome with sorrow, he reverently offers up wine and several kinds of food.’”

“Then the first, second and third sacrifices are offered as before. The chief mourner then returns and makes the announcement in the ancestral temple that the ceremonies have been completed. The day after this he goes to the ancestral temple and opens the tablet cabinet, and then goes through the ceremony of inviting the spirit to descend. He then says:

‘-- (year) -- (month) -- (day) the filial son -- (name) makes his parents’ -- (name) glorious. They were originally interred in an unlucky place, and now in -- (year) -- (month) -- (day) in (name of place of burial) he has corrected this by re-interring them. The ceremonies now having been completed, he, offering wine and fruits, sincerely and reverently makes his announcement.’


After the sacrificial ceremonies are concluded the tablets are returned to their cases. After three months the mourning garments are discarded.”

“ Re-sodding the grave. --A fortunate day is chosen and the attendant will spread out a mat in front of the grave and arrange the offerings and sacrificial vessels. The master of sacrifices will then wash his hands, and kneeling will light the 359 incense and pour out the libations thrice on the ground, inviting the spirits to come and partake. He will then pour out wine into the cups and say:

‘--(year) -- (month) -- (day) the filial son -- (name of chief mourner) prostrates himself and says, that before, the grave was not properly completed and therefore the sodding has perished. It will now be repaired, and prostrate he begs that the honourable spirits will notbe startled and frightened. Therefore with wine and various kinds of food he reverently makes this announcement.’

Then he offers sacrifices to the spirits of the grave and says:

‘The grave of -- (name of deceased) having gone to ruin, we propose to repair it, and we beg of you that you will watch over it and remove in future any misfortunes which threaten it. Therefore we reverently offer unto you wine and fruits. Will you deign to accept them?’

After the grave has been repaired sacrifices are again offered and the master of sacrifices says:

‘--(year) -- (month) -- (day) the grave having fallen into decay we have repaired it. Prostrate we pray that the honourable spirits may now rest in peace for ever.’

Then if the family can afford it flat stones are placed in front of the grave, and when this is done sacrifices are again offered as before and the master of sacrifices says:

‘-- (year) -- (month) -- (day) the filial son -- (name) begs to announce that his poverty before not having permitted him to complete the ceremonies, he now prostrate says that he has prepared flat stones and grave stones in order to set a mark upon the grave, and he prays that the spirits may now rest in peace.’”

On the last day of the month, the ancestral temple will be thoroughly cleansed, and the head of the house will, early on the morning of the first day, arise and bathe and go to the ancestral temple. He will get out the dish of sand with the plant in it, and place it in position and also the censer and incense. He will then offer up fruit and wine. He will then open the tablet case and will bow low and return to his proper place. He will then pour out libations for the descent of the spirit as before. He will then light the incense kneeling, and afterwards prostrate himself twice. He will then pour wine into the cups kneeling, and again prostrating himself twice, will retire. All the above ceremony is for the descent of the spirit. Then follows the offerings to the spirits. The relatives present will all prostrate themselves twice, and the head of the family will take the bottle of wine and pour out a cup for each of the tablets. He will then prostrate himself twice and return to his proper place. When the offerings are set out and arranged, spoons and chopsticks are of course placed in position. The relatives all wait quietly a short time in order to allow the spirits to partake of the food. The head of the clan then prostrates himself twice and replaces the tablets. The sacrificial offerings are then removed.”

“ Holidays on which sacrifices are offered (in addition to those mentioned above). -- 5th day of 5th moon; 7th day of 7th moon; 15th day of 8th moon.

Confucian doctors are supposed to enter the ancestral temple every morning, prostrate twice, light incense, and then retire.

In the offerings of first-fruits, the fruit should not be eaten until after an offering has been made in the ancestral temple.

If anything special occurs, such as an appointment to office, or passing an examination, or removing to another place, or the birth of a son, but not of a daughter, it should always be first announced, and offerings should be made.”

“At the grave sacrifices are offered on New Year's Day; Vernal equinox; 5th day of the 5th moon; 15th day of 8th moon. In any of the sacrificial offerings peaches are not used. This is because peaches are the fruit of the gods.

The mourner's staff on which he leans must have six joints. -- All mourners from the Tai Kong upward must cease their occupations. They can study the classics if they so like, but must not study poetry. Any reference to music or enjoyment of any kind must be avoided. The mourner must not see his wife frequently, as if he does he will forget his sorrow. He must avoid seeing things which give pleasure, or gaming, or seeing useless friends. He must not speak in a loud voice, nor scold, quarrel, or fight. If anyone insults or even strikes him he must overlook the fact. If he has a warm room he should think of his parents in the cold grave. When he partakes of food he must think of his parents who are unable to do so. When he sees friends, he must think of his parents who are unable to see friends. In whatever he does, he must always think of his parents who are in the grave.”",,,,,,
Ritual21,Healing ritual,"A Shamanistic Performance

Vitashevsky gives a vivid description of a performance at which he was present. He came too late to see its initiation, called oloxxo oloror (on the seat he is seated) and, he understood, at this point the shaman’s voice and the drum beats should be weak and almost listless. When he entered the earth hut the shaman was sitting on a small bank in its eastern corner, so that he had to pass between him and the fireplace. The shaman wore his shamanistic coat and his assistant dried the hut master’s drum by the fire. The shaman asked for a tobacco pipe. He inhaled the smoke several times and asked for the drum and stick which were given to him. He rose, walked a few steps, and jerking his shoulders and head up and down, he tried to beat the drum, but rejected it because it was wet. He asked that his own drum be dried. This was done very quickly. Evidently his drum was already dry.

Now began the second or preliminary stage, called mäñniyär and sürgüyar when the shaman searched for the direction in which to locate the evil spirit that captured the sick man’s soul. And, indeed, at times he stopped beating and gazed into the distance. In the beginning of the act the shaman beat the drum slightly and sang in a low voice, but gradually his voice and the drum beatings rose to a climax and the shaman turned his face to the southern window of the hut. The act lasted from fifteen to twenty minutes. During the performance the shaman imitated the neighing of a horse and the cry of some bird.

The third act consisted in inhaling from the sick man the evil spirits causing the illness, and in dispatching them to the south. The shaman had to dispatch four evil spirits. First the shaman sat on the floor behind the fireplace, not far from the entrance, holding in his left hand a jalbyr (see above) which he stretched out in the direction of the patient. Gradually, still in a sitting position, he moved toward the sick man, singing louder and shaking his head more and more. At a distance of about a meter from the sick man he rose from the floor and sat on a bank prepared for him. He continued to cry out his incantations, touching the sick man with his jalbyr . This movement is called jalbiyal . Slowly the shaman rose from the bank and, dropping the jalbyr, bent over the sick man. In a powerful voice he commanded his spirits to fulfil his order and to pass from the patient. He pretended to swallow them in order to dispatch them to their dwelling places. To this end, he ran out to the yard and after dispatching the spirits to the “south” he fainted. He was taken up and carried into the hut, quite exhausted. Then the shaman started for the “upper” world and brought back one of the souls, the kut, of the sick man which had deserted him, having been frightened off by the evil spirits. The shaman looked around to see whether any evil spirit was left near the patient. Once more he pretended to start for the “upper” world and he fainted when he returned to this world. He was revived by his assistant and the shaman sang his last incantation. This was the final act of the performance.

Vitashevsky was unable to record the text of the performance for the following reasons: it was almost dark in the hut; in spite of his perfect knowledge of the Yakut language many expressions in the performance were incomprehensible to him; the use of a phonograph to record the text would be prohibited by the shaman or otherwise influence the performance. When Vitashevsky invited the shaman to his hut for an interview the latter declined the invitation, saying that a shamanistic performance was too serious a subject for futile curiosity. The shaman, learning of Vitashevsky’s presence during his performance, said that it would fail to benefit the sick man. Sieroszevski refers in his book on the Yakut 1 to a shamanistic incantation, but other students of the Yakut criticized the authenticity of his text. I was more successful with Yukaghir and Tungus shamans. For a remuneration they recited their incantations in my phonograph and also dictated to me in order that I might be able to compare the two versions. In my work on the Yukaghir 2 I gave the Yukaghir text of a shamanistic performance on the Yassachnaya River. But the shaman himself, whose mother was a Yakut woman, originally recited the text in Yakut, which appeared in the Russian edition of my Yukaghir texts published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1900 (p. 118).

Ritual22,"Ayy ysyaxa (kumiss spring festival in honor of the ""creators"")","The most important festival among the Yakut is connected with the preparation and use of kumiss, and is called ysyax, or kumiss festival. It has both a social and a religious significance. During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests.

Two kumiss festivals in honor of deities are arranged during the year by the owners of large droves of mares. One of them, in the spring, is consecrated to the Supreme Being and the head of the benevolent deities of the “creators” (ay y ), — to Lord Bright-Creator. The first milking of mares in the spring is also consecrated to the Supreme Being. The spring festival is called Ayy ysyaxa (“kumiss festival in honor of the ‘creators’ ”). Spring, as the period of the revival of nature, appears as the season of happiness and abundance. In the prayers addressed to the “creators,” they are implored to bestow their blessing upon the people.

The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them (see Plate XVII). The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. This is done so that the vessels, when softened by the liquid in them, shall not collapse. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn, to every deity; and formerly horses were often consecrated by being driven to the east.

The plate just referred to represents one act in a spring festival. 2 In front of the altar stands the steward, having on one side of him the owner of the drove, and on the other the latter’s wife. All three face to the east side of the sky, where the benevolent deities have their abode. On the right side of the altar stand nine innocent youths in a row, and on the left a row of nine pure maidens, with goblets filled with kumiss consecrated to the benevolent deities. The splendid festival attire worn on this occasion 3 by a Yakut girl is shown in Plate XX, which represents both back and front views. The trimming consists of valuable fur, silver pendants, and other decorations.

The steward addresses a prayer to the “creators,” begging for blessings,—increase of horses and cattle, a good harvest of hay, good health for the people and animals, and an abundance of food. Then he takes the kumiss-festival ladle ( [unknown]s[unknown]ax xam[unknown]yaha ), and makes a libation, in the direction of the dawn, to the benevolent deities (see Plate XVII). Then, while making a libation to the ground, he addresses the local deity, “the owner of the place” ( än doidu iccitä ), asking him not to harm the inhabitants of the spot and the members of the clan. After that, the steward, with the help of the sacrificial ladle, proceeds to divine. He throws the ladle towards the sky: and if it falls with the front part upwards, it portends the granting by the deities of future abundance; and all the people utter the joyful cry Uru!

Then the boys and girls give the goblets with the sacrificial kumiss, according to the directions of the steward, to the elder and honored members of the clan, both male and female. These, after placing themselves,—the men on the right and the women on the left of the altar,—drink off the kumiss from the goblets, and pass them on to the less important and the younger people. Behind every honored or aged member of the clan, sit or stand his domestics, less esteemed relatives, young men, and laborers. He looks after the welfare of each of these. When the goblet is emptied, it is given back to the steward or the host to be filled.

At the same time, not far from the altar, other stewards are preparing tables, or simply boards on the ground, on which are placed piles of horse and cow flesh, and dishes of melted butter. Every chief of a family or clan receives a large portion of meat and butter, which he divides among his people.

The whole day passes with songs, round dances, games, races and other contests, and shamanistic performances. The poetical choral songs of the young men and girls, in praise of the spring and love, are most interesting. TROSTCHANSKY relates, also, that during the kumiss festival the change of winter to spring is personated in a contest between two men. One of them, dressed in white, represents spring, and is called “son of ‘creator’ ” ( ay[unknown] uola ). The other, clad in black, represents winter, and is called “son of evil spirit” ( abas[unknown] uola ).

Ritual23,"Ritual cleaning of the grove, Baha festival","The festival commences with the villagers washing and the priest, the godet or messenger and a few others going down to the grove in the morning to get it ready for the rites. They put up two sheds of sal branches and thatching grass - one at the three trees for Maran Buru, Jaher Era and the Five-Six and the other at the mahua tree for Gosae Era. The sheds sometimes have great straw tassels and at Dhamna a straw monkey dangled from a branch. The priest then bathes and goes round cow-dunging a little patch at the tree of every bonga. The party then returns to the village; and either puts some thatching grass on the manjhithan or gives it a new roof. The priest now breaks his fast and presents those who have made the sheds with food and rice-beer.

In the afternoon, he gets together all his gear - a mat, a small open bowl of water, a new broom, three new winnowing fans, bangles, necklaces, a bow wrapped in cloth, an arrow, a new basket, a battle axe, two buffalo horns, a new earthen pot and a skein of thread. He purifies them with water and places them in the courtyard.

The village meanwhile goes out on the Baha hunt. All the men and boys take bows, arrows and axes and the crowd makes a long round of the fields. The hunt ends at evening and the men then assemble at the priest’s house.

When I saw the festival in Karhabel in March 1943, the priest put out the gear in the courtyard and squatted down beside it. The godet faced him. Some girls went dancing out of the house and after a few circles in the village street began to break away. A faltering gasping blare was sounded on a buffalo horn. The priest’s wife handed him the three new winnowing fans and in the gathering darkness a chorus of a dozen men started up the Baha songs.

Under the rafters
Who is sitting
Who has taken his seat?
The priest is sitting
Under the rafters .
Who will cut
The wood for Maran Buru?
Who will thatch
The shed for Jaher?
The priest will cut
The wood for Maran Buru
The priest will thatch
The shed for Jaher .
What has the priest brought?
What things has he set down? He has brought
A bowl of oil
He has put down
A box of scarlet powder
He has brought
A winnowing fan of bamboo
He has set down
A basket of bamboo .
Ju Gosae
We have washed
And cleaned our heads
In whose courtyard do you sit today?
In whose courtyard do you sit erect?
In the priest’s courtyard I am sitting
By the small path I sit erect
In the priest’s courtyard
Is liquor made from flowers .
Chita, why are you late?
For whom do you delay?
Ja Gosae
For whom do you delay?
My father’s kinsmen are away hunting
My brothers beat the jungle
Chita, because of this you dallied
For this you made delay .

As the songs went on the priest sat gravely holding the fans while from time to time a drum-beat sounded.

After an hour’s singing, three mediums - the men who were to be seized with Maran Buru, the Five-Six and the Lady of the Grove - went out and washed. Again the drum-beat sounded and they came back and sat before the basket. Again the horn blared and the priest brought out some sundried rice and placed it on the fan. Then with slow and solemn fervour, the songs began again.

On the top of a pipal
The barbet calls On the branch of a banyan
The woodpecker sings
The year has turned
The year has come again
The woodpecker calls
Turning it has turned
The barbet sings
Coming it has come
The woodpecker calls
The weevils have gone
Away with the river
The insects have gone
Into the sea .

In the shade of a pipal
At the foot of a banyan
A barbet sings

The woodpecker is singing
The Five chose

The Six have made the dance start

Suddenly the three began to shake their heads in a wild frenzy. First one and then another gave a piercing howl, their arms shaking and jerking. The priest said, ‘Who are you?’ and the men answered, ‘Maran Buru’, ‘The Five-Six’, ‘Jaher Era’. A moment later, ‘Jaher Era’ had seized the basket and with trembling hands had put on the necklace and bangles and snatched the broom. ‘The Five-Six’ seized the bow and arrow. ‘Maran Buru’ took the axe and the three men in all the frenzy of possession went stumbling out of the house and over the fields to the grove. As they hurried through the gloom under the starlight, ‘The Five-Six’ leading and ‘Jaher Era’ twirling the broom, they let out grisly shrieks. When they reached the grove, they went from tree to tree, shrieking and sweeping every shed and patch. When all the stones were swept and visited, they hastened back to the village.

When the party returns, the priest washes the feet of ‘Jaher Era’ and ‘The Five-Six’ and puts the broom back in the basket. Then each of the mediums washes the priest, pouring water first on the priest’s head and then on his own. Finally the bow and arrow are put in the basket and the three mediums squat in a row. The priest now issues them with fans and rice. The three jerk their heads and the rice trickles through their hands. They toss it six times over their hands and the priest says ‘Gosae, today the places in the grove are newly cleaned. The priest has bathed. Tomorrow we shall worship in the Flower’s name. Bring no ill meanwhile. Give no hurt. Make everything go well. If in the cleaning anything is amiss, condone it.’ The mediums reply, ‘No ill will come.’ Then the priest says, ‘Go back to the forest. The horse and the umbrella are weary. Seek for your pipal and your dimbu leaves.’

When the bongas have ‘left’, rice-beer is drunk, dancing starts and songs are sung throughout the night. These songs have a variety of themes. Some are celebrations of the hot season and the flowering forest.

Ritual23,"Ritual cleaning of the grove, Baha festival","Festivals

THE two great village festivals take place in the spring and after the harvest. The name of the former, Baha, means “Flower festival”. It is held after the full moon in the month of Ph[unknown]algun (February-March). The hot season is about to begin, sap is rising in the trees, and the sarjom is resplendent with blossom and tender green leaves. Until the festival has taken place the women do not gather the matkom blossoms which provide them with both food and drink. It is held on different days in different villages so that the celebrations can be accompanied by a round of visits to relatives. The opening day of all festivals is a day of purification, known as “bathing day”. On this day at the time of the Spring festival two temporary sheds are put up in the sacred grove and the young men carry out a hunt in the woods near the village. The priest completes his preparations and bathes certain articles in the waters of the village tank. At sunset three hens are taken to his house by the villagers, who remain there to dance. Three of the young men become spirit-possessed. One impersonates the “Five”, another the Old Lady of the Sacred Grove, and the third takes the part of Mara[unknown]n Buru; they seize the implements which the priest has purified earlier in the day and make play with them. The priest receives them with respect; he washes their legs and, addressing the spirits, he asks for good fortune during the coming year. When this is over the young men are recalled to their senses by a series of sharp taps on their backs. Dancing is continued throughout the night in the village street just outside the priest’s house.

In the early afternoon of the following day the priest is accompanied by the villagers in a singing procession to the sacred grove. On arrival there the same young men are again possessed and run away across the fields, being chased and brought back by the rest of the young men. The priest now assumes an attitude of great humility towards them. He receives them with a cloth tied round his neck in token of the submission of the village to the spirits. The hens are sacrificed and cooked in a hash with rice. The priest and his wife partake of one and the men of the village consume the rest of the food, after which everyone returns home except the priest. He has to remain in the grove until the young men return to escort him. He is then taken to every house in turn and received with great honour. His feet are washed in each house and he receives presents of grain and beer. The subsequent merrymaking dies down during the night. The celebration is completed on the following day, when the co-priest offers drops of his own blood to the boundary spirits.

The following account of the Spring festival held in Barikul in 1939 was recorded by Babulal at the time, and it conveys, as no outside account could, the atmosphere of the festival. He begins:

“ March 17. Today is the bathing day for the Flower festival. Early in the morning the bailiff called everyone to make the booths ready in the sacred grove. The women were busy boiling their clothes. One young man from every house took part in the thatching of the booths; some brought sarjom branches from the jungle, and others made small wooden seats for the spirits. The priest washed all the things for the spirits’ house—the bangles, the necklace, a bow and arrow, an axe, also basket, broom, bells and horns—and he brought back to his house an earthen pot of water for luck. The place of sacrifice was smeared with cowdung, and oil and vermilion were placed there in readiness. When the young men had finished the thatching they bathed, and then said to the bailiff: ‘We go now to Sonadungri for the flower hunt; see that the drums beat and the horns sound at the foot of the banyan tree, for when we hear them we shall start. Do not delay, for we want to begin.’ The bailiff completed his bath quickly, and taking four youths with the drums and the horns to the banyan tree by the stone fence he did as he had been requested. And so the youths went out hunting. They caught fourteen hares, thirteen jungle fowl, four partridges and ten squirrels. These they brought home hanging from a pole which was slung from the shoulders of two men. When they arrived back at the side of the large tank, the spoils were divided, and some we gave to the men of neighbouring villages who had joined in the hunt. The flesh was roasted and divided; some was given to the killers, some to the dogs, some to the villagers, and a special portion to the widows.

In the evening the bailiff called everyone to gather for the ‘spirit possession’. We took three new winnowing fans and all collected at the priest’s house. Three men were possessed, and each of them took hold of a winnowing fan. They were seated facing the east, and the priest put sun-dried rice on to the winnowing fan of Mara[unknown]n Buru . Immediately to his left sat M[unknown]ańjhi ha[unknown]ram, 1 and on the left of M[unknown]ańjhi ha[unknown]ram there sat the Old Lady of the Grove, and to them also rice was given. The spirits spoke and shook the rice in the winnowing fans. Then they began to shake their heads from side to side, and called out, ‘His-s[unknown]ahãk!’ At this everyone called out, ‘Greetings, Lords!’ for the spirits had come. The Old Lady of the Grove placed the necklace round her neck, put on the bangles, seized the broom and put the washed basket on her head, and then ran away to the grove. Mara[unknown]n Buru and M[unknown]ańjhi ha[unknown]ram went after her with the bow and arrows and the axe, and in the darkness the Old Lady lost her necklace and the bangles. When they all ran back to the priest’s house and the loss was discovered we told her that she must find them again. So she went once more to the grove and brought them back. After this we said to all of them: ‘The horses are weary; let the spirit riders descend!’ The priest then applied vermilion on their cheeks, their chests and their backs, and they came to their senses. So it ended. Next the villagers began to dance, and the first song was this:

High up in the pipal tree
Sings the crimson-breasted barbet;
It wanders through the country,
It flies over the land.

Then they began the late evening dance and many other dances, such as the road dance, and they sang:

Down in the valley blooms the ha[unknown]t tree, sister;
Come, let us make flower chains, sister;
Come, let us wear the flowers, dangling.

The priest spent the night sleeping on a bed of leaves, while everyone else, old and young, men and women, danced the night through. Next morning the priest told the bailiff quickly to collect the hens; he himself bathed and went to the grove, taking with him sarjom and matkom flowers, sun-dried rice, flour, oil and vermilion, all in a new winnowing fan. He also carried a brown hen and on his open upturned palm a small brass water-pot, while his wife carried the earthen pot of water brought for good fortune. Youths and maidens conducted him to the grove, dancing as they went, and there he began to make the sacrifice. The youths and the maidens danced in the grove, the young men singing only the Flower dance songs, and while the dancing went on the priest proceeded with his work. With the flour he made the circles and the squares. A hen was offered in each of the circles; the brown hen was slain in the Moslem fashion, while the other two had their necks cut. Again each of the spirits took possession of a man, and they sucked the blood of the slain birds. One circle was for Mara[unknown]n Buru, one for the Old Lady of the Grove, and one for M[unknown]ańjhi ha[unknown]ram . In the squares the priest sacrificed to the village spirits, and as we had brought many hens it was not possible to offer them all, so some were killed by knocking their heads on the ground. When it was all over, the priest cooked the heads of the first three hens with flour, making cakes of them, and then ate them and drank beer. This is called ‘lifting the head’. Then the folk in the village who offer to the ‘Five’ took flowers from the trees of the grove, returned to their own houses and made mounds of the flowers. Near these mounds they offered either hens or goats. (Some of those who worship the ‘Five’ invite all their relatives at this time and make the sacrifice in the grove.) Meanwhile the priest drank beer and cooked a hash of rice with the brown hen.

Late in the afternoon the young men went to receive the priest back into the village. They went dancing to the grove and danced round the priest. Again the spirits took possession of the three young men, who danced with the others. The Old Lady again wore the bangles and the necklace and carried the basket on her head; likewise Mara[unknown]n Buru took the bow and arrows and M[unknown]ańjhi ha[unknown]ram held the axe. Just before sunset the men came to their senses, the priest gathered up all the things, and his wife carried the lucky water-pot. As before, the youths and maidens placed the priest in their midst and again the spirits came and danced with the others. Then in every house, from one end of the village street to the other, they washed the feet of the priest. He put sarjom flowers into the hair of the girls who washed his feet, and all the people sprinkled water on to each other. On that day we are free to sprinkle water on anyone else. When we reached the priest’s house he poured out two pots of beer and we all drank. Again the dancing began and went on till a late hour.

March 18. Yesterday was the full Flower festival day; today is the ‘stale’ day of the feast. Yesterday everyone was drunk, and again today they began to drink early. There were many visitors in the village, for we had invited daughters, sisters and sons-in-law to be with us. We had to feed them well, and we were busy with all the preparations. One prepared rice, another flour, while the men killed cocks or goats or pigs, for yesterday they had no time to feast well. Even so, in some of the houses a few people became drunk before they had time to eat. Those unfortunates had no meat either yesterday or today. Most of the time went in feasting, though there was some dancing in the village street, and the dancers sang:

Let us gather, O elder sister, the matkom ;
Let us wear the sarjom flowers, elder sister, in our hair;
Let us drink, O elder sister, the juice of the matkom 

Most of the singing was done by a small band of old men and women who went into each of the houses and were given beer and matkom flowers by the people of the house. In our part of the village there was a fierce quarrel. Some of the men who went to stop the trouble were themselves beaten and returned very angry to their homes. Before midnight everyone was fast asleep, for all had been drinking heavily. I thought to myself, if anyone came here tonight with evil intent he could steal anything he wanted with the greatest ease; and, in fact, that is what happened. During the night someone stole from the headman’s house five goats, male and female.”

Having given his account of the festival, Babulal then proceeds with the following account of the myth which carries back the origin of the observance to the period of the wanderings:

“It is said that at one time our ancestors were moving from one place to another for fear of Mirja Turuk. During that period they lost their ‘religion’. When it was realized, one man from each of the twelve clans went out in search of it. Now the names of those who went out on this quest, taking with them an uncastrated goat, a Li[unknown]t[unknown]a 3 pig and some rice in a basket, were as follows: Ap’ńambondak’, Hutumńambańjak’, Narkakin ce[unknown]de—these were two—Ote and Bole, and some others. They assembled in the Somoe valley in the forest of Siń, and there they remained for twelve years. The feathery grass of that place all died, but none of them wished to go on farther to look for their ‘religion’. All of them held back; they said one to another: ‘You go first.’ In the end, Ote and Bole said in desperation: ‘All right, we shall lead the way.’ Going farther, they entered the Man forest. The other ten followed them, but when they came into the forest they could not find Ote and Bole. They searched the whole forest through without success. Some of them at length found some footprints, whereupon they sang this song:

Look here, look at this,
The footprints of the nilgae ;
Look here, look at this,
The footprints of the wild buffalo.
In what forest have they entered,
The footprints of the nilgae?
To what forest do they lead,
The footprints of the wild buffalo?
Into the forest of Man have they entered,
The footprints of the nilgae ;
To the forest of Siń have they led,
The footprints of the wild buffalo.

However, they could not find Ote and Bole; they searched everywhere, but they saw no tracks but the tracks of the nilgae and the wild buffalo. Nowadays the Santals say that the Ote and Bole who were then lost have become the ancestors of the ‘sahibs’. One reason why we say this is that often when we are beginning to dance and at the commencement of songs someone calls out these words: ‘Look, friends, the white hare has run away.’ This saying is the signal to begin the dance. The word ‘sahib’ is amongst us for a long time; in many ways our customs are the same.”

This rather obscure piece of reasoning is in fact widely current among the Santals, at any rate among those who are unfamiliar with the origin of the word “sahib” and its currency in India during Moslem times. “White hare” is a term often applied to Englishmen. On one occasion I emerged rather suddenly from the waiting-room at a wayside station on to the platform near to where a group of Santal women were unloading a railway wagon. Unaware that I might understand their conversation, one of the women remarked, “The white hare has just come out of its hole!” greatly to the amusement of her companions. Babulal relates at this point how the brothers were met in the forest by Mara[unknown]n Buru and led by him to the foot of various trees. Babulal places the story in Moslem times. He makes the following remarks about Mara[unknown]n Buru and his actions: “ Mara[unknown]n Buru deceived them so that when they wanted to offer sacrifices to [unknown]Th[unknown]akur they should do it in his name, afterwards to the Old Lady of the Grove, and then to the ‘Five and Six’. In former days he used to be called Li[unknown]t[unknown]a go[unknown]det’, Li[unknown]t[unknown]a the bailiff. Mara[unknown]n Buru became the guardian of the ancestors. He used to take them out hunting and taught them how to kill iguanas, water-snakes, squirrels, mongoose and hares. On such days as they caught nothing in the chase he used to show them the dead cattle at the end of the village street, and would say to them: ‘It is quite all right for us to eat these too; these are white deer.’ And so we began to eat all these things.”

He offers some more information about the Flower festival in his narrative: “In the prayer at the time of the Flower sacrifice we must use these words in addressing the spirits: ‘If you are not pleased with the offering we shall dishonour your mother.’ We consider that the spirits will listen to us if we use these words. We also say that if we urinate in a standing position the Flower spirits will be pleased. For this reason, if anyone sees us urinating in a standing position and scolds us for it we reply: ‘We are making offerings to the Flower spirits!’ The Flower festival is for flowers and fruits what the offering of new rice is for rice. Until the priest has placed flowers in the hair of the women and eaten some of the matkom, no one will wear flowers or eat the matkom . From the new year until after the festival the priest has to live very carefully. He eats nothing in other people’s houses, because others may have been on a visit to villages where the festival has already taken place and then he might eat something that is forbidden. One of the songs that is sung when the priest is being escorted to the grove and again back to his house refers to the fact that the Dol Jatra festival of the Hindus has already taken place.

‘The Dol is over now, maidens, the Pata comes next;
You must buy shields, maidens, for yourselves.
In the maidens’ pubic region is the black bee’s honeycomb;
You must buy shields, maidens, for yourselves.”’",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual24,Naming ceremony,"An essential part of the ceremonies is the naming of the child, whereby it acquires a definite status in the village and among the kinsfolk. In the area round Sarenga the naming is sometimes accomplished on a day different from that on which the shaving and bathing take place, and it is the naming ceremony that emphasizes the social obligations of the household. The villagers may bathe on the fifth day and gather at the house for the naming on the seventh day. The midwife receives her payment at the gathering, and she is paid in cloth and rice, receiving also a bangle for cutting the cord. She receives twice as much rice for a boy as for a girl. The name is chosen by the parents of the child and it is announced to the villagers by the midwife. Holding the child in her arms, she says to them if the child is a boy: “From today call him so-and-so when he goes hunting.” If the child is a girl she says: “From today call her so-and-so when you call her to draw water.” The first-born boy is named after his father’s father and the second boy is named after his mother’s father. The first girl receives the name of her father’s mother and the second girl that of her mother’s mother. When these names have been used, children are given the names of uncles and aunts, with a preference on the whole for the father’s family. Before the naming the guests ask: “Of what country is this child?” When the name chosen comes from the father’s family, the question is answered by giving the name of the father’s village, the mother’s village being given when the chosen name comes from her relations. If a child cries excessively it may be put down to the fact that it is unhappy over its name. Babulal of Barikul wrote: “Sometimes among us the children sleep happily right from birth and at other times they cry like crows and kites! In that case we call an ojha to tell us the reason and we say to him: ‘See what this child is up to; why does he cry?’ The ojha asks for oil, reads the omens and then says: ‘Such and such a dead relative is claiming that the child be named after him.’ This usually happens when we want to name the child after someone on the mother’s side. The dead ancestors on the father’s side do not like to have it so.” The above passage occurs in a part of his diary where Babulal was reporting the birth of twins, for whose naming there are special rules. Twins are known as bo[unknown]nga children, and their advent is not regarded as a misfortune. He continued his narrative: “Today the babies did not cry at all, for they were to have bo[unknown]nga names.” One explanation is that Mara[unknown]n Buru had twelve sisters who were twins, and I have been told that the children of Cando were twins. The pairs of names that are given to twins are drawn from Hindu mythology and they are, for girls, Cit[unknown]a and K[unknown]apu[unknown]r, D[unknown]a[unknown]rgi and Po[unknown]rgi, Hisi and Dhumni; boy twins are named Ram and Lokhon, Loba and Kisur, Cand and Bh[unknown]aira, Sidho and K[unknown]anhu. Most Santals when asked have denied categorically that dissimilar twins are posible. The only case met with in eleven years were twins born at the Mission Hospital in Sarenga, and it proved impossible to follow up their subsequent history.

The name given at the ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar ceremony is known as the bhitri ńutum, which means literally the “inner” or “private” name. Everyone knows what his own inner name is, but it is little used by others. In addition to his private name each person receives at least one nickname, which is called the “upper” or “outer” name. This is necessary in part because of the prohibitions attaching to the use of names by certain categories of relations. If a boy has been named after one of his grandfathers, then all those who are prohibited by relationship from pronouncing the grandfather’s name, e.g. the grandmother, are equally prohibited from applying that name to anyone else. Even those who could pronounce the name do not do so while the grandfather is alive, in order to avoid confusion. The nicknames given in early childhood do not remain fixed but are replaced by others as the boy grows up. Some result from the same kind of easy intimacy and teasing affection with which we are familiar in English society and are bestowed by those who stand in a “joking” relationship with the boy. A new element has been introduced through the naturalization of many Hindu names, particularly among those Santals who have received some education. In many cases Bengali names that bear some resemblance to the form of the private name come into use. Thus Podo has become Padma Lochan and Kala has become Kalachand. Ernest Soren was known throughout the countryside by the name that he received at his baptism. At the time of his ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar he was given the name of Singrai, this being the name of his paternal grandfather’s elder brother. From the same time he was addressed as Jhongol, thus receiving not only the private name but the outer name of the same relative, who was not then alive. Before he could walk he was usually addressed as [unknown]Then[unknown]ta, a name that signifies a restless bundle of mischief. Later when he was growing up he was known by his contemporaries as [unknown]Dang[unknown]ra Sorkar, or Sorkar for short. The name Sorkar is often applied to those who are going to school, but he was known as the “bullock” Sorkar because he did not conceal his fondness for beef, whereas educated Santals are generally supposed to conform to Hindu custom and shun it. Names of relatives are bestowed without regard to whether the relatives concerned are living or dead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual25,Caco char (causal initiation/purification ceremony),"The village community takes no formal notice of the growing child after the performance of the janam ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar until he is ready for the ceremony of initiation, or caco ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar . Caco is a word that means a toddler, one who is learning to walk. The ceremony, however, is not performed until the child is growing up. It is somewhat misleading to describe the ceremony as one of initiation, for in comparison with the elaborate ritual with which initiation is accomplished in many parts of the world it is a pale and colourless proceeding. In the Bankura area the performance of the rite is of an extremely casual nature. It is nevertheless the equivalent for Santals of initiation ceremonies in other societies, and it retains its importance not because of the intrinsic character of the ritual but because of certain consequences that follow from its non-observance. Unless the caco ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar has been performed, no Santal boy or girl may be married, nor cremated after death. It may be that the custom has been drastically modified because of the expense involved, as the whole village should be feasted. It is now customary for families to wait until the ceremony can be performed for several children at the same time, and it is therefore delayed until the impending marriage of the eldest child makes it inevitable. In the village of Barikul, Babulal recorded a case in which the father and the mother had been living together for some years without having themselves gone through any marriage ceremonial. For both of them it had been a second marriage, and as they were extremely poor their plea to set up house together had been allowed and the marriage celebration that had been postponed was indefinitely suspended. The time came when they wished to arrange a marriage for their eldest son and they found themselves involved in a difficulty. Until the formal celebration of their own marriage had taken place their son could not marry because in its absence they could not carry out the caco ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar of their boy. The problem was solved by going through one of the permitted forms of marriage themselves, after which on the same day they performed the initiation of their three sons. They were scolded by the villagers who gathered for the occasion, but again pleaded their poverty.

The whole of the population of the village is invited for the ceremony, and each person must at the very least be given two cups of beer for each child on whose behalf the ceremony is being held. The feast for the whole village is not practicable except for a very few, and it is regarded as sufficient if the village officials are presented with a meal of rice and meat or chicken curry. If possible, the midwife who presided at the birth of the children bathes them in the courtyard by pouring water over them; and if she cannot, this is done by one of the old women present. Water is also sprinkled over the assembled guests. The jogm[unknown]ańjhi recites the myth of Santal origins; beginning from the account of the creation of the world and the founding of the clans, he brings the story up to date by leading to the birth of the children in the particular family with which the villagers are at that moment concerned. Then there follows a dance in the courtyard, and songs are sung in honour of the family. The event is neither preceded nor followed by any period of instruction. Such materials as exist for comparing the institution in different parts of the Santal country suggest that possibly its observance is of greater importance in the north, particularly in the Santal Parganas. Bodding has described the ceremony, basing his account on the published Santali account of the traditions. Recently a long and full account of the ceremonial has been published in Santali, and this account comes from the same area but does not include a description of an actual observance. On the other hand, Mr. C. L. Mukherjea’s account of Santal culture to the extreme south in the state of Mayurbhani omits all reference to the caco ch[unknown]a[unknown]ti[unknown]ar, which suggests that it is at the very least an inconspicuous element in the life of the area.

The universal custom among Santals of cicatrization of the boys and tattooing among girls may have been connected originally with initiation, though there is no evidence of any such connection in the past and it certainly does not exist at the present time. Boys make a number of self-inflicted burns on their left forearm. The resultant circular scars are usually five in number, but the only rule is that the number of scars must be an odd number, for the odd numbers signify life while even numbers mean death. There may be only one scar and there may be as many as seven. There is no ceremonial to accompany the practice, and boys burn themselves as soon as they are old enough to understand the shame of the cowardice implied by the non-possession of the scars. They usually do it when they are out in the fields together herding the village cattle. A fire is lit and a small piece of rag is rolled and set alight. Each boy then presses the burning[unknown]rag on to the skin of his left forearm as often as he wishes to do so, and the marks remain for life. The operation is known as sik[unknown]a . Santals believe that they will be known by these marks in the after-life and if they do not show them to the guardians of the next world they will be eaten by worms as “large as a foot-pedal rice husker”. The same explanation is given for the custom of tattooing the girls. Apart from this motive there is no evidence for a magico-religious basis of the practice. The term for tattooing is khoda, and girls must in all cases be tattooed before their marriage. The whole operation may not be completed at once, but may be spread over two or three cold seasons during which the tattooers carry on their work. In this area the work is done by women of one of the blacksmith castes who come from districts to the west. During the cold weather they go from one village to another, and they are, of course, paid for their work. The operation is performed with a long needle, and the dye consists of lampblack which is mixed with human milk—if possible with the milk of the tattooer. There is no relation between the designs and the clan to which the recipient belongs. Marks are tattooed on the temples, also on the side of the nose, on the cheeks and on the chin. Designs to look like necklaces are common, and sometimes there is a decorative belt round the waist. Arms are decorated as with bangles and armlets, and there may be a design on the back of the hand. The same is true of both legs and ankles. In fact, the decoration motif appears to be uppermost and was well expressed by an old woman who said: “When I die I shall lose all my ornaments; but these at least I shall be able to take with me.”",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual25,Caco char (causal initiation/purification ceremony),"Caco-Chatiar

The second critical period in the life of the Santal is sought to be guarded by a purificatory ritual called Caco-chatiar. This ceremony may be observed any time before marriage and is in effect, the admission of the male-child to all the privileges of the community life of the tribe. It is relevant to add that marriage is not permitted to any one who has not gone through the ceremony and should one die (without going through the ritual) his dead-body cannot be cremated nor are his bones thrown into the river, the most important step in a Santal funeral. It is, however, frequently seen that the father of several children performs the Caco-chatiar ceremony of all of them together.

As an initial step, Jang hà[unknown]n[unknown]dia, is prepared in the early morning. The villagers procure oil and turmeric. The Headman and Paranik drink rice-beer ( hà[unknown]n[unknown]dia ) and send for the villagers. The women then rub oil and turmeric on the bodies of the Nacke (village-priest) and their assistants and this is done to all in a customary order of precedence from the village-officials down to the villagers. Rice-beer is served. The Santals dance and sing.

Then comes the turn of an old man of the village, a Guru, the repository of Santal lores to recite the tribal story of the creation of the world and the wanderings of the Santal (already narrated in the 1st. Chapter, Santal Genesis and Migration) ancestors till they came to their present habitat.

It is then emphasised that all the impurities of the male-child have been purged away and by participating in the drinking bout of hà[unknown]n[unknown]dia, they have initiated him into the full rights and responsibilities of adult manhood. The ceremony concludes with the appeal to the Mo n re n ho[unknown]r, “We were black like crows, now we are white as white paddy-birds, you five men are our witnesses” (Campbell).",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual26,Dihri,"Dihri Hunting: The Dihri hunting, which is the most important hunting of the Santals which takes place once a year in the month of Falgun (February and March). Dihri, their hunting priest carries a big branch of a Sal tree with leaves and goes to the market, where people seeing him understand the purpose of his coming. As each leaf represents a day so they count them all and go out for hunting after just the number of days as indicated by the leaves of the branch. In this hunting expedition people of distant villages take part. The Dihri is responsible for the hunt, i.e. (all goes well and no mishap occurs). By divination he finds out as to who are threatened by any danger during the hunt, and advises them to turn back but they generally make him sacrifice fowls for them to Sin Bonga to avert the impending calamity. He performs some ceremony and offers sacrifices to bongas of the forest where the hunt is to be held, to ensure success and safety in the following way:

The Dihri enters the forest and being naked, pricks his whole body except the joints, with the thorn of a bush. He then draws a small circle on the ground with powdered rice and puts some adwa rice mixed with the blood which comes out from his body and makes a vermilion mark inside the circle. The Dihri then gives a little rice to all the forest bongas . Others who are following him, then enter the forest with bows and arrows.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual27,Telnahan,"Five days after the death, the ceremony of tel nahan (oiling and washing) is performed. The village men gather at the dead man’s house, wrap up a little grain, rice, and three pieces of country bread, collect from the house sufficient rice for a village meal and then assemble where the pot of the departed was buried. The man who mounted the pyre then disinters the pot with the ‘flowers of bone’, takes out the culm and pours the bones into the hands of the chief mourner. The latter wraps them in their original cloth and a little fire is made at the place where the pot was buried. As the flames leap up, the men say ‘The hut of the old woman is ablaze’ and the party move down to the end of the village. Here they meet the women. Some ebony sticks are tied together and stood up like a tripod. The pot is set down on the top and the man who mounted the pyre goes round it three times, strikes the pot with a fourth stick and smashes it to pieces. This dislodges whichever enemy has killed the dead one and who until now has dogged his soul. Then the chief mourner holds out the bones in his hand and the women rinse his clenched fingers with turmeric, milk and water. He then knots the bones into his waist and the men go on to a piece of water beyond the frontiers of the village.

At this water the leader purifies a piece of ground, squats by the water, sets out five leaves and on each of them puts some grain and a piece of country bread. He then offers to Maran Buru, Porodhol, Pilcu Haram, Pilcu Budhi and to the dead, throwing into the water each leaf-plate in turn and addressing them ‘O Pilcu Haram, Pilcu Budhi, today we have brought the fallen one from the village. We are bringing him back to the shadow of his house. Do not let him linger outside. Do not lodge him under the eaves. Take him by the hand and guide him to his rest.’ ‘O fallen one, today we are bringing you to the shadow of your house. Do not dwell outside it. Do not linger under the eaves.’

The men then bathe and rub themselves with oil and after that, they buy some fowls or a pig with money given by the chief mourner. These must be bought outside the village boundaries and are eaten with the rice before the party returns. By consuming this feast, ‘in the presence of the bones,’ the mourners associate themselves with the dead and coax him to return. While the men are away, the women also bathe. After sundown, the men return to the village and assemble at the dead man’s house. Here the feet of the chief mourner together with those of his two companions are washed by the nearest female relatives and the ‘flowers of bone’ are consigned to a new receptacle. This is either the hollow handle of a new broom or a small but new earthen pot. The vessel of the departed is then taken inside a room and put up in the rafters beyond the reach of smoke.

If the dead person has been buried, and there are no ‘flowers of bone’ the villagers begin the day by going to the grave. The chief mourner collects a symbol for the bones by taking up a handful of earth from near the body. He then goes down to a place near water. There he burns the earth and puts it in a new earthen pot. The villagers return and the pot is put down on a tripod of ebony sticks at the end of the village. The women then gather, the pot is smashed as if it were a pot with actual ‘flowers of bone’ and the burnt earth is held in the hand and rinsed with turmeric, milk and water. After that the burnt earth is used as a proxy for the bones and the ritual is the same as in cremation.

The villagers now gather in the courtyard and the leading mourner assumes the role of the dead man while two villagers take the parts of Porodhol (the general ancestors) and Maran Buru. The actor for the dead demands water from all the dead man’s kinsmen and the inmates of his house and when he is offered it, he demands water from all the villagers. ‘Maran Buru’ and ‘Porodhol’ are also given bowls of water which they drink. The three are then given bowls of rice-beer and the leader asks the dead man how he died. ‘I went of my own will,’ he says. ‘Porodhol’ is also asked and he replies, ‘I was inside. I do not know.’

After that, the dead is asked if the future holds any danger. If there is danger he replies, ‘Consult the ojhas and jan gurus. They will give medicines. They will prescribe the sacrifices. All will be well.’

The people then drink rice-beer and go to their homes. The dead person is now, as it were, in transit. He has lost the enemy that killed him but he has not as yet been admitted to the ancestors. He is still at one with the ‘flowers of bone’. They are his temporary abode and he must now dwell for some time in his house until his kinsmen can arrange for his final passage.

With the ablutions of the people, the village bongas cease to be unclean and sacrifices can again be made to them. The house of the dead one remains ‘in the shadow’ but his kinsmen, outside the immediate family, are at liberty to perform weddings and make sacrifices.

While these ceremonies are proceeding and sometimes even on the day of death itself, the house of the dead person is visited by a jadupatua, a humble member of a Hindu painter caste. This individual combines the roles of itinerant minstrel and funerary beggar. He brings a few scrolls of paintings depicting the Santal myth of creation, the Baha festival, life in Death’s kingdom and sometimes the goddess Kali and the Krishna cycle. He squats in the courtyard, unrolls his pictures, entones a recitative and finally produces a sketch in which the dead person is shown with blank and sightless eyes. In the corner of the drawing is a picture of a cow, a fowl, a bowl or a brass plate according as the jadupatua assesses the wealth of the family. At the end he exacts the animal or utensils as his tribute for restoring sight to the dead and only when it is given does he put the eyeballs in the sketch and leave the house.

The jadupatua’s tribute is paid either from the dead person’s own moveables or if he has left none, from the property of the joint household, his guardian or his heir.

Some weeks after the oil and washing ceremony, the chief mourner fixes a day for consigning the ‘flowers of bone’ to water. The villagers assemble at the house, drink rice-beer and the dead man, Maran Buru and Porodhol are again evoked and questioned. ‘Today, we are taking you to the river. May no ache of belly or head rack us; keep us from all harm in the way’, and the dead man replies, ‘I shall keep all harm away. Go and come like the wind.’ The leader then takes out the ‘flowers of bone’ in their little cloth and women pour turmeric, milk and water over his clenched hand. The ears of a fowl are chopped off and the blood stains some rice. If a date for the feast has been settled a cow is reserved for sacrifice and the blood is got by cutting a slit in the ear. The blood-smeared rice is then put in a leaf packet while in another leaf, a copper pice and some sindur are tied together. The leading mourner now puts on a new dhoti, and knots the ‘flowers of bone’ into his waist.

The party sets out. The man who mounted the pyre carries the pot or drags the broom, sweeping the earth as he goes. At the village end, the leader squats on the ground and the man who mounted the pyre offers a fowl, tears off its head, and throws the head and carcase away. The pot is then smashed or the broom thrown away.

If the former custom of taking the bones to the Damodar river is followed, the leader takes one or two villagers with him and goes on to the river. If however this is not done (and it is nowadays no longer usual to make such a long journey) the villagers go in a body to a river or stream. If the departed was the owner of a tank they go there but if there is no river close at hand, they scoop a hole and fill it with water. The chief mourner goes to the west, taking the bones with him and never looking back. At the water he ‘buys the ghat’ with a pice. Then he mixes the bones with the blood-besmeared rice and entering the stream consigns them to the water.

After the bones are immersed, offerings are made to Maran Buru, Prodhol, Pilcu Haram, Pilcu Budhi and to the dead himself. ‘O fallen one, today we have washed ourselves in the great river. Do not linger outside the house. Do not dwell in the eaves. When we return we will arrange your last feast.’ The new cloth is then discarded and abandoned. The offerings are eaten and the villagers go back.

On the way they buy fowls or a pig from a village not their own and after eating a meal with rice, they wait till sundown and then return. After that, the chief mourner gives them rice-beer and they go to their houses.

With this ceremony, the dead one is released from his temporary shell - the ‘bones of flower’ - and is now an acknowledged ancestor, a family bonga. But he is not yet fully of the dead, neither has he entered the realm of Jom Raja, King of the Dead. He must now dally in the family’s bhitar or private shrine and await the feast when his kinsmen will take their last farewell and send him happy and honoured, to his long home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual27,Telnahan,"Telnahan or chotokaman (Preliminary purification)

The Santal observes ceremonial pollution for a period till he is in a position to procure the requisites of purification. This affects the particular clan to which the deceased belonged. Thus we gathered at Mayurbhanj that when a Nij Ha n sdak’ dies, all persons belonging to the same totem are affected, and they desist from eating fish, meat and oil, nor do they borrow fire from another man’s house for nine days, till the asidha (ceremonial pollution) continues.

On the expiry of the period, the Headman arrives at the house in mourning with the village elders and the other invited relatives. A Santal barber then shaves the members of the family, whereupon, they bathe after rubbing their bodies with oil and oil-cake. Now, a ceremony follows when three tooth-sticks, four fingers in length, oil, oil-cake, na[unknown]rkan hasa (a kind of earth to wash the hair) are arranged on three Sal -leaves and offered to Mara[unknown]n Buru (the chief presiding deity), the deceased and the dead ancestors, with prayers so that Ma[unknown]ra[unknown]n Buru may admit the released spirit after purifying it with all these materials.

Now, all men have a ceremonial bath closely followed by the women. A [unknown]Tika Murmu now addresses the gathering, “They were so long under ashida . Now they are purified. We can now take them back.” Now all shout h[unknown]oribol as a sign of approval. Two men now again fall into a trance (jhupar) and impersonate Mara[unknown]n Buru and the dead man. They are liberally plied with a supply of rice-beer, along with the “Mò n [unknown]rè n hò[unknown]r” (village elders). At night, fowls are offered by the tribe (Simkutam) and the inmates of the house worship them ( Mara[unknown]n Buru and the decreased) with a hotchpotch, called Giritora . The ceremonies now conclude with a tribal feast and drink.

Thereafter, some rice and vegetables are kept on leaf-plates and later, deposited in a basket along with a water-pot, as a meal spread for the spirit of the deceased. Next, it is hung from a rafter of the deceased’s house. The following morning, the basket is closely inspected; and, if any food-particles can be seen, it is believed that the decreased has eaten the food and has washed his hands with the water in the pot.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ritual28,Jiling Dahar,"Jiling Dahar (going to the river Damodar with the bones)

Now the day arrives for carrying the bones of the dead to be consigned to the holy waters of Damodar. The elders with the Headman begin to pour in the deceased person’s house. Some prepare sacks for carrying food-stuff and the bone, while two others fall in a trance (jhupar) impersonating again the dead man and Mara[unknown]n Buru, when their wishes are consulted as to the person who will carry the bones. On the reply of the person impersonating the deceased, the man is shown his luggage. Now three fowls are sacrificed in honour of Mara[unknown]n Buru, the ancestor-spirits and the dead man, the heart being reserved for the Chief Presiding Deity (Mara[unknown]n Buru) and the remnants of the sun-dried rice that accompanied the offerings, are carefully preserved to be carried along to Damodar.

Next, the bones previously buried are carried to the cross-road, washed with water and hà[unknown]n[unknown]dia ràsi (the best part of rice-beer), being rubbed within the folds of a yellow-coloured cloth. The women offer presents of money to the bone, and it is placed inside the sack prepared for the purpose. The empty pot (which contained the bone so long), is now placed on three twigs of Kendu tree (called so in Oriya) while the carrier walks round it thrice and then facing cast breaks it amidst cries of H[unknown]oribol by the village-elders. Thereafter, he leaves for his destination being escorted by two men to the Gadi (halting place for men going towards Damodar).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual29,Bhandan or Final Purification,"This last feast which is known as bhandan cannot be performed earlier than nine days after the return from the river but is permissible at any later date. It is celebrated for all except small children and if the initiation ceremony of caco chatiar has not been performed this is included in it as part of the ritual.

The village men first bathe and shave and assemble in the house of the dead. They are given rice-beer and a meal. Then the chief mourner again sustains the role of the dead man, his companion is possessed by Porodhol and a third enacts Maran Buru. The dead man is re-identified. ‘It is I,’ he says. Then he demands water from all his immediate relations and after water is given he again declares the cause of his death. Finally rice is offered to him and the family say, ‘Keep us in peace. Do not trouble us. Do not take anything away.’ The three men then emerge from their roles and are given rice-beer.

The jogmanjhi now erects a sal branch in the courtyard and the chief mourner sacrifices a fowl by clubbing it on the head. The cow with the slit ear is then led in, tied to the branch and after dedication, it is felled by the jogmanjhi with the butt-end of an axe. After that the near kinsmen offer fowls, pigs or goats.

In cutting up the cow, the side on which it falls is carefully observed. The fore-leg of this side together with the head is allotted to the villagers, the neck is given to the barber and out of the rest three divisions are made. The first is cooked with rice and is eaten by all, i.e. the villagers and members of the house. The second is divided among the villagers who take the pieces to their homes. The third is kept by the dead man’s family. The man who does the bhandan gets the hide.

A little later some cooked rice is brought out and sitting before the branch the chief mourner offers it first to the dead and then to the grandparents. ‘O dead man, today we have given you rice. Take and eat it gladly. Look to your children. Keep them from harm. Go your way gladly. Keep all sorrow or ill far from the house.’ Rice-beer is then brought and offered in the same way.

After this the flesh is brought out and the chief mourner again sits before the branch. He faces east holding a dismembered leg of the cow and the man then recites the traditions of the ancestors. This recital often lasts the greater part of the night and ends, ‘We have cleaned the head that was full of ashes and the mouth that oozed blood. he who was black as a crow is white as a swan.’ With this recital the chief mourner is purified. The villagers drink more rice-beer. Then they dress the flesh and cook it with rice. The villagers’ share is taken outside and eaten in the road while the family consume their portion in the house. These later provisions are mandatory for the village share is known as the ‘feast of the street’.

When the bhandan is over, the impurity that has hitherto dogged the household ends and the family can again sacrifice to bongas, drink rice-beer, use vermilion and celebrate weddings. It is therefore of great importance that once a man has died his bhandan should be done with reasonable speed. If, for any reason, a family cannot do the ceremony quickly, a substitute bhandan is performed in its place. On the day of return from the river, a fowl is offered by the chief mourner. It is cooked with rice and offerings are made to the departed and the grandparents. The dead man is asked to accept the food and so make way for weddings and the placation of the bongas. After this the chief mourner is declared finally pure. The people are given rice-beer and go to their homes. Some months or even years later, a full bhandan is performed so that the spirit of the dead may be finally appeased.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual30,Marriage Ceremony,"Marriage

THE choice of a bride is limited firstly by the strict observance of tribal endogamy. No Santal who forms an alliance with a non-Santal can hope to be reinstated in society. The only cases that occur are found when individual Santals are away from their village community; Santal women working in “the east” do sometimes become the concubines of men of other races, but I have heard of only one man who had taken to wife a woman of another caste. He was a fugitive from the police who had been away from his village for some years, and he was living with a woman of Ha[unknown]ri caste. The choice is further limited by the rules governing clan exogamy and also by the laws that regulate “avoidance” between certain relations by marriage. A man may marry the sister of his elder brother’s wife with whom he is on terms of familiarity. On the other hand, he may not marry the sister of his younger brother’s wife. All these restrictions are accepted without question; they are part and parcel of the religious and magical framework within which life must be lived.

Then there are many practical considerations that enter into the forming of any alliance between two families. Parents on both sides of the marriage make careful inquiries about each other’s families. The location of the bride’s home is of some importance. It is not advisable for a youth to marry a girl from his own village. “A hen and a bride from the same village run to their homes”, says the proverb. Just as it is foolish to expect a hen from another house in the village to become domesticated in new quarters, one cannot expect a bride to settle down happily when her own parents are so near at hand. On the other hand, if the bride’s home is too far away, the burden and expense of mutual visits become considerable, and so it is best to seek a bride whose home is within a day’s easy walk from her future husband’s home. Inquiries are made about financial stability and health. Particular attention is paid to signs of leprosy, which is widespread, and also tuberculosis. The qualities most admired in brides are a capacity for hard work and good health, cheerfulness and a steady disposition. In spite of the prevalence of pre-puberty marriage in India, it is extremely rare among Santals. In the only case that has come to my notice, an old man of sixty-five, whose only son had died, arranged a marriage for his granddaughter in order that she might be settled in life before he passed away. The girl was seven years of age and she was married to a boy of fourteen. Only a token bride price was received. Girls are usually married when they are about sixteen, while young men are generally between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. There is no test of a prospective bride’s virginity. The fact that sexual experience of a kind is common before marriage is known to all, though it is not openly or actively encouraged, and a girl who is thought to be a wanton may have to wait for marriage through one of the more irregular channels that are open to her.

The initiative is taken by the parents of the bridegroom. Parents of marriageable girls are not always passive spectators, but any inquiries instituted by them are likely to be tactful and indirect. When the parents of a young man have made tentative inquiries and wish to begin negotiations they engage the services of a friend as a “go-between”, known as a raebaric’, to visit the home of the prospective bride. He addresses the parents of the girl in some such roundabout manner as the following: “Have you found a place yet for your new cooking pot? I have some friends who are unable to cook their herbs and so they have asked me to find a new cooking pot for them.” If the report of this first visit is satisfactory it is followed by an exchange of ceremonial visits. First a party from the bridegroom’s village journey to the bride’s home. The go-between is accompanied by the young man’s parents and some of their friends, a party of five or seven persons in all. Omens by the way are noted, and they are not all left to chance. Before the party enter the bride’s village the raebaric’ goes ahead and tells the people to do nothing that will upset the auspicious nature of the occasion. When leaving their own village or on entering the girl’s village, should they see fire, an axe, a woman with a load of wood on her head, a snake or a jackal crossing the path from left to right, they return home and the whole matter is dropped. If, however, they see a full water pot, a cow, a new brass plate, a panniered bullock, the pugmarks of a leopard or a jackal crossing the path from right to left, the omens are good. If all goes well, details of the bride price are fixed, a time is arranged when the bride’s relations will pay their return visit and all is sealed by the proferring and acceptance of tobacco and beer.

On their way home from the bride’s house the members of the party sing.

Behind this song there lies a story. It happened once that a party were visiting the home of a prospective bridegroom. They were well pleased by the condition of the house and went away satisfied with their welcome. During the whole time of their visit the young man whose home they had gone to see was seated on the veranda. His legs covered by straw, he busied himself plaiting straw rope. The next time they saw him they found that he was lame and they had been tricked. The warning serves a useful purpose, for cases where defects have been concealed are not unknown.

The party sing also about the bridegroom.

During the month of March 1939 Babulal recorded: “Eleven people from our village, men and women together, went today to Ambritpal to see a bridegroom. When they came to our village there were seven of them. As we were going to see the bridegroom our party was larger by four; it is our custom that more should go to see the bridegroom than come to see the bride. The party returned in the evening, singing songs as they came, for they had been drinking. The girl’s relations asked them: ‘Well, and how was the bridegroom and what did you think of the house? Were you pleased?’ They replied: ‘We are satisfied. The lad looks well enough and the house was in good condition, only we saw no “elephants’ eggs”.’ One of the men said: ‘I sat so that I could see right into the inner chamber, but I could see nothing there.’ A fortnight later a similar party went from Barikul and returned at an earlier hour. A number of people said: ‘Why have they come back so soon? It looks as though they were not satisfied about the bridegroom. If they had been they would not have returned before sunset.’ Others, however, said: ‘No, they must have been pleased because they have been drinking!’ ”

Tradition enjoins that a further set of ceremonial visits follows these first visits in order to ratify the “engagement”, but when the families are already well acquainted both time and expense are frequently saved by going through with the engagement on the first ceremonial visit. The ceremony is known as horok’ cikhna, the “putting on of a sign” in token of the agreement. When the bridegroom’s party arrive at the home of the prospective bride they are welcomed as honoured guests. String beds are placed in the courtyard for them to sit on, their feet are washed and massaged with oil and they are served with beer. This over, they are taken into the house and given parched rice with molasses to eat. Their hands are then washed by their hosts and they are served with more beer before emerging from the house. Then the guests adjourn to bathe, and on their return they are seated on mats in the courtyard to eat a meal. This meal consists of rice and curry. Unless food consists of rice and curry it is never considered to be a full meal. While the menfolk eat, the women prepare themselves by dressing their hair; they put vermilion in their hair parting and also on both sides of the forehead, the marks going up from the outer end of the eyebrows in the shape of horns. When all have eaten and washed, the guests sit down once more and the bride-to-be is brought out by a married woman to pay her respects to the visitors. When she makes a low obeisance before the bridegroom’s father he invests her with the “sign”. This is either a necklace, a piece of cloth or a pair of bangles. When she bows before him she places at his feet a small brass vessel full of water, and in it he drops two rupees.

In the conversation that follows, all outstanding details of the wedding arrangements are completed. First there has to be agreement about the bride price. This is known by two different terms, both of which are of Indo-Aryan origin. The first term, gono[unknown]n, is from a root meaning to count or calculate, and the second, pon, is from a root meaning earnest-money or a pledge. The amount is variable, and this leads to some bargaining. Thirty years ago seven rupees used to be considered a high figure, whereas now the sum varies from eleven to twenty-one rupees. The jogm[unknown]ańjhi of the bridegroom’s village asks the bride’s father to declare his wishes. He does so, not in words, but by placing the correct number of cowrie shells in leaf cups, whereupon the cups are passed over to the visitors. When a small bride price is agreed upon, the bridegroom’s father understands that he cannot expect any gifts at the time of the marriage and he will have to bear the expenses of his own party for new clothes. Ordinarily, however, the bride’s parents present the cloth to be worn by the bridegroom during the marriage ceremony. In addition, his family are entitled to receive the present of a cow or a goat, according to circumstances. The bride’s family expects, in addition to the bride price, to receive a cloth for the bride’s mother, one for her father’s eldest sister and one each for her two grandmothers.

Some agreement must also be reached about the time of the marriage. This must not take place in the month in which either the bridegroom or bride was born. Formerly, I was told, there was no other prohibition regarding the month. Nowadays, however, the general practice of Hindus in Northern India is followed. Astrologers are not consulted, but marriages may not take place during the rains, and the most popular months are during the spring when the harvest has been gathered in and food is abundant. When the time is approaching, the actual date of the wedding is arranged by the go-between, and the gir[unknown]a is used to mark off the days remaining.

The whole community in both villages is vitally concerned in the due celebration of the wedding, and this fact is emphasized by the rôle of the village officials. The jogm[unknown]ańjhi of the bride’s village acts as the master of ceremonies from the time when the marriage booths have to be erected until the end. The headman of the bridegroom’s village does not take part in the preliminary visits by virtue of his office, but when the two families immediately involved are satisfied that they wish to proceed, both headmen are called in. They have to be present when the engagement is confirmed, and they are consulted about suitable dates. The final “contract” at the climax of the wedding celebrations is entered into by the people of the two villages, and it is made by the respective headmen. The village priest also plays a part, for the community involved in the marriage includes the spirits, who are guardians of the welfare of the tribe, and the ancestors, guardians of family and clan. Their blessing has to be sought. In an interesting passage Dr. Verrier Elwin says of the marriage ceremonial of the tribes of the Maikal hills: “There is little religion in it.” On any definition of religion it would be difficult to maintain this thesis with regard to Santal marriage. The whole passage is quoted here, for the rest of what is said does apply in most of its detail to the Santal form of marriage: “We have already spoken of this ceremony as a work of art. There is little religion in it, but it has great social and symbolic value. It is hard to conceive of a better way of impressing on a man and woman their social and sexual union. The tying together of the clothes, the exchange of rings, the first meals together, the ceremonies by the river that symbolize mutual aid in domestic, sexual and food-obtaining activities, are of great significance. They are all the more important because some of them are things that a boy and girl would never do publicly together.” Among the Santals many of the symbolic acts cannot be truly interpreted apart from their relation to the unseen world. The invocations used in addressing the spirits at the time of marriage come as near to true prayer as any used at other times. Before the wedding party leaves the bridegroom’s village for the home of the bride, the bridegroom’s father provides a hen for the village priest, who offers it in the sacred grove. He prays: “We offer to you a hen because of the marriage booth. Accept it, enjoy it and grow big. Now we are about to go as a marriage party to such and such a village. Guard us so that on the way through the forest there may be no sudden fright, no tripping, no tumbling, no spells, no enchantments. Clear the way for us to right and to left, O father spirits. There we shall eat and drink. May we suffer no stomach pains, no head pains. Guard us also so that there be no quarrels, no bickerings, no divisions, no disturbances, no ruin, no spoiling between relations.”

Before the marriage, booths are erected in the courtyards of both homes, and all the villagers assist in the work. Straw ropes are strung from side to side in the village street with mango leaves inserted through the strands, and the courtyards are decorated in the same manner. The posts of the booths are made with branches of the matkom tree. In the floor a hole is dug in which some fresh turmeric mixed with sun-dried rice, five cowrie shells and three leaves of dhubi 3 grass are buried. These are covered in and then the whole floor is plastered with cowdung The young men who build the booth are feasted and provided with beer. On the day before setting out for the bride’s village the bridegroom’s party go to the village bathing place for the “water marriage”. One of the young men digs a small hole at the water side into which the water can seep and three arrows are planted round the hole. Vermilion is placed on the arrows, while at their base are placed some cowrie shells and a hen’s egg. One of the women shoots at the water with an arrow, while another strikes it with a “sword”, generally a stick. Then libations of beer are poured out to Mara[unknown]n Buru and the ancestors before all present partake. Finally, water is drawn in pots and taken to the home. Again when they reach the courtyard another hole is dug, the arrows are placed round it and the water is poured into the hole. The “anointing girls” are tied to the arrows by a thread fastened to their left wrists, and they have to husk a grain of rice in their fingers without breaking it while the bridegroom is shaved and bathed preparatory to being anointed. The anointing ceremony is carried out in the evening by unmarried girls who anoint the assembled company with a mixture of oil and turmeric. The village priest and then his wife are first anointed, after which the remainder of the officials, then the villagers, then the father and mother of the bridegroom, and lastly the bridegroom himself.

A similar ceremony is carried out in the home of the bride, beginning with the “water marriage”. The bride is led out in procession from the house to the courtyard holding the hand of her hili, or elder brother’s wife, and accompanied by two unmarried girls, the “anointing girls”. In her right hand the hili holds a brass pot full of water which she sprinkles to right and to left. The other girls bear plates in their hands on which there are several leaf cups. One contains a small lamp that has been lit, and others contain turmeric and sun-dried rice and sprigs of dhubi grass. The women in the courtyard sing.

The procession moves round the booth three times, after which the bride is seated under its roof. The anointing follows, and the bride is anointed after the dhubi grass has been placed on her head. When the ceremony is over the bride is led back into the house and the older folk dance and sing:

If the distance between the two villages be great, the party of the bridegroom will have arrived on the outskirts of the bride’s village on that evening and are accommodated in a special shelter for the night. They do not enter the village, but at the first sign of approaching morning the go-between comes from the bridegroom’s camp, bringing with him a small quantity of the oil and turmeric left over from the bridegroom’s anointing, and with this the bride is once more anointed.

Meanwhile the bridegroom’s party make ready to approach the bride’s house. The jogm[unknown]ańjhi and go[unknown]det’ of the village meet them at the end of the village street, where they are asked to wait awhile. Mats are placed for them to sit on and they are given tobacco to smoke. The bridegroom’s party always enter a village from the west end and leave from the east end. The officials who greet the party are accompanied by a band of young folk from the village who sing and dance and who in the course of their songs make insulting remarks about the bridegroom and the village from which he comes. These insults are expected and have to be accepted in good part. When they at length set out for the bride’s house, the bridegroom is carried by a woman who lifts him and carries him on her hip as she would a child. On first arriving at the bride’s home, some of her friends pretend that the bridegroom is not properly groomed, so they proceed to shave him again with a leaf for a mirror and a rough piece of wood for a razor. When he greets his future father-in-law he places a necklace round his neck while his father-in-law winds a turban cloth round his head, after which they sprinkle water over each other with a spray of mango leaves. They exchange pan and embrace each other. When the bride is brought out of the house she is carried in the same way as the bridegroom, and first of all they sprinkle sun-dried rice over each other (this is called “sowing” the rice), and follow it by sprinkling water with the sprays of mango leaves. The bride is seated in a basket and made to face the west, while the bridegroom faces towards the east. Then he takes from a small wooden box that is wrapped in his waistband the vermilion which he proceeds to place on the bride’s head, and as he does so the assembled company make the air resound with shouts of “ Horibol ”. This is sheer Hinduism, for it is the invocation of Hari, one of the names of Vishnu the Saviour. The bridegroom helps the bride down from the basket, places an iron bangle on her wrist and iron betel nut crackers in her hand. Then they are led inside the house, where they are set down and fed on a dish of black beans and rice. The bridegroom has to make a show of refusing to eat until the bride’s father presents him with a rupee.

The party outside begin to drink beer that is variously named by the different groups. The bride’s fellow villagers drink beer “in honour of the guests”, while the bridegroom’s fellow villagers drink “in honour of the new relations”; the young people are permitted to drink “dew beer” that will help them to avoid the chill they might otherwise contract by dancing and drumming through the whole night. While a feast of goat’s meat curry and rice is being prepared the guests sit around and talk and sing. The headmen of the two villages, however, have some work to complete. The presents from the bridegroom’s family are handed over by their headman to the bride’s headman. These are for the most part clothing. The bo[unknown]nga it[unknown]at’ is a cloth of twelve cubits for the sister of the bride’s father. It[unknown]at’ is a word that ordinarily means food left over on the plate of one who has eaten; perhaps it is applied to these presents in the sense that they are left over when the bride price has been given and received. The bride’s mother receives a cloth of eleven cubits. The grandmothers receive cloths of ten cubits known as the he[unknown]re it[unknown]at’, or husks. The bride’s father may receive a cow, and her maternal uncle is given a money fee, it is said, instead of a cow. The amount given is small, usually a few annas. The headmen themselves receive a half-rupee each, the jogm[unknown]ańjhi receives a loin-cloth and the go[unknown]det’ one anna, while the anointing maidens receive a half-anna each. In this way the special duties and responsibilities of various parties to the wedding are acknowledged. The bride’s maternal grandmother is made to “pay” for her cloth. She does so by presenting five small measures of rice, five sticks of turmeric and five rolled cheroots to the bridegroom’s headman, all being wrapped in a bundle together. The bride price that is paid at this time is also paid through the headmen. Many of the presents and fees are known by hidden names. The bride price is called the “milk tree”, a term that is also used sometimes for a mother; the fee received by the headmen is known as the “tree of the sacred grove”; the cloth for the bride’s mother is called “hot water”. 1

When the feasting is over the bridegroom’s party gets ready to leave and the members are escorted to the end of the village street. There once more they sit down and a final beer-drinking takes place. This is drunk only by the headmen of the two villages. Water from a brass pot is spilt on the ground and the headman of the bride’s village delivers a marriage sermon. Here and there the words of the sermon may vary slightly, but the form is fairly well established. The bridegroom is addressed: “Well now then, from today we have tied a wooden cow bell round your neck. When you go out to hunt and when you go to collect fruits in the forest you may eat a half of whatever you find, but you must bring a half of it home.” The bride is told: “Well now, until today you have been able to go about just as you wanted to, but from today we have tied a wooden cow bell round your neck; you can no longer go about to markets and festivals as you please.” The headman of the bridegroom’s village is told: “O father headman, from today our two villages have become as one. When the girl has any illness or when she dies, it is for you to see to it. Up till now you have not been responsible, but from today we shall require of you blood of the head, blood of the ear. If any mishap befalls and you cannot spare a man to send the news, then you must send word by a dog. Formerly you were strangers and you used to pass by our village. Now if any of your people is passing this way going to hunt or going to market and he is thirsty, he must stop and ask for a drink.” The headman of the bridegroom’s village makes a suitable reply acknowledging the new ties that bind them together.

The comparative freedom of association between youths and girls in markets, fairs and other gatherings of Santals gives rise to situations that cannot be dealt with as normal marriages, and so other forms are recognized. When an unmarried girl becomes pregnant, providing there are no barriers to the marriage on account of clan and family relationships, she is encouraged to go to the home of the youth involved in the case. Bride price is paid, but the ceremony of putting vermilion on her head has to be postponed until after the birth of her child. Sometimes the village has to take cognizance of a situation arising out of the disagreement of the parents of either a girl or a boy to a marriage which they both desire. It may be that the boy and girl have run away together. Then the village officials call a council to regularize the situation. The father of the bride can claim only half the usual amount of bride price and the only cloths provided by the bridegroom’s father are for the bride’s mother and maternal grandmother. The third cloth is not given, I was told, “because it has been eaten by white ants”, i.e. when the young couple lay out on the ground of the forest together. There are two ways open to a youth to force the issue on unwilling parents or an unwilling bride. Marriage by capture is still recognized as valid, provided that the girl expresses her willingness to stay with her captor. In such cases all the usual presents have to be given and a double bride price must be paid. The second method open to an impatient bridegroom is to waylay the girl of his choice and forcibly place the vermilion on her head. This is usually accomplished with the aid of his friends and often with the secret connivance of the girl concerned. Marriage by this means has to be recognized, but the fellow villagers of the outraged girl’s parents do not accept the situation without protest. They march to the young man’s village and if on their arrival they receive a friendly welcome and are asked to be reasonable they sit down to talk and make arrangements, which include an enhanced bride price by way of compensation to the girl’s parents. If, on the other hand, they are received sullenly and the young man hides from them they become angry and do all the damage they can to his home, from pulling down the roof to killing any animals that may belong to his family.

Occasionally it happens that a girl takes matters into her own hands and forces her way into the home of the young man whom she wants to marry her. This, according to Santals, is only a ruse, for no girl would go to such a length unless she had very good reason to suppose that she would be welcomed. When this has happened marriage does not necessarily follow, but the girl must not be turned out and sent back to her own home until a council representing the two villages has met and sanctioned such a course. If marriage is decided upon, the girl’s father has to forego the bride price. Another type of concession is made when the parents of the bride are considered to be too poor to pay all the expenses of the full ceremony. The wedding then takes place in the home of the bridegroom and it is known as a [unknown]tunki dipil bapla. [unknown]Tunki is the name of a small basket in which the presents, including a cloth for the bride, are carried on the head—the meaning of dipil —to her home. These things with the bride price are taken to the bride’s home, but the party return on the same day to the home of the bridegroom, taking with them the bride and her relations, and there the main ceremony is performed.

Ritual31,Burial,"Death and Burial

THE Serbian peasant will speak quite simply and naturally about his own death, and even make due material preparations for it. The coffin, or at least the materials for it, will often be laid up ready for many years before it is required; and a sum of money saved up and set apart for the funeral expenses.

When it is felt that the time has come, the priest is sent for and the sick person is anointed. When the patient is suffering from some complaint which is known to be fatal but which does not prevent him as yet from leaving the house, the Anointing may take place in church after the Liturgy. But as a rule, of course, the ceremony is performed in the sick-room in the presence of the patient’s relatives and friends. The room is often full of people, and even strangers may be there from a sense of Christian duty. Every person holds a lighted taper. A dish is provided which contains grains of wheat as a symbol of death and resurrection. A wine-glass stands in the middle of it, and seven little pointed sticks, each with cotton-wool wrapped round the upper end, are stuck into the pile of wheat grains round the wine-glass. Into the latter the priest pours a little oil mingled with wine.

The Confession and Communion (from the Reserved Sacrament) of the sick are simply very greatly shortened forms for the ministration of those sacraments; and there is another service of commendation of the soul which the priest says when he is called to the bedside of one in extremis .

Reference was made in a previous chapter to the grasp which the Serbian has upon the fact of the need and power of forgiveness, and this is well exemplified when he comes to die. He will call not only the members of his family, but also his friends and neighbours, and ask their forgiveness for any wrong he may have done them. There is a stereotyped form in which the response is made. “May it be forgiven thee in this world and in that other.”

Even if the dying person is unconscious or otherwise incapable of asking forgiveness, his friends will come, and of their own accord approach him and say these words of forgiveness over him.

When all is over the priest comes to say words of consolation to the bereaved, a crucifix and candles are brought and a service said for the departed soul. And the coffin is censed and blessed before the body is placed in it.

The funeral usually takes place on the day following the death. It always strikes the Serbians as strange that in England several days should be allowed to elapse between death and burial. So long as the body remains in the house none of the bereaved will eat or drink anything, nor will any sweeping or cleaning be done in the house. But after the body is taken away, the house is swept thoroughly throughout, and the brush used for the purpose is thrown away and never used again.

The clergy precede the coffin when it is carried to church with cross, lights, incense, and singing. The mourners follow, everyone is bareheaded, and however far it may be, everyone goes on foot. At church the coffin is placed upon a stand before the Royal Gates, in the centre of the ikonostas, and the burial service is read. Three lighted candles are placed on the coffin in positions corresponding to the head and shoulders of the deceased, and all the mourners hold lighted candles also. The service is of some length and contains psalms, hymns, litanies, and prayers for the repose of the soul. The beatitudes are also read with a short prayer after each, and there is an Epistle (I Thess. iv. 13-18) and a Gospel (St. John v. 24-31). After the reading of the latter, the candles are extinguished.

A Serbian village churchyard presents a strange appearance to English eyes. As well as gravestones there are erected a number of large wooden posts with great wooden triangles attached to the top of them. Both the tops of the post itself and the triangle bear many wooden crosses of different sizes, and hung upon the whole erection are often ribbons, scarves, etc. The triangles are said to be of pagan origin. The ribbons, etc., are gifts for the dead, and the Serbian peasant believes that these things are in some way received by the departed. There they remain until they are destroyed or scattered by the weather. No one ever touches them, even when, as is sometimes the case, they are of considerable value. It would be a great sacrilege to remove them.

Either in church or at the grave, speeches are made, very often by lay friends of the deceased. If the latter was a person of some social importance, there are several speeches, others being made at the “stations” between the church and the graveyard.

These stations consist of short prayers and litanies. In towns the body is preceded by boys carrying fans and candles, and behind is a choir singing “Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal,” etc. This anthem is always sung: if there is no choir, the priest himself sings it.

At the grave the prayers are read, and the priest again blesses the body, and pours over the coffin a little mingled oil and wine in the form of a cross. The coffin is placed in the grave, the nearest relative throws in a copper coin, and others throw a handful of earth, again pronouncing words of forgiveness. They also address the deceased, imploring him to carry loving messages from them to others who have died before when he meets them in the spirit world.

It is believed that the departed soul remains for some time near the scenes of his earthly life. Thus, in the room in which he died some bread and wine are left for him during the night which follows the death. The soul visits the Holy Mountain (Athos) and then Jerusalem, and from the latter place, on the fortieth day after death, takes final leave of this world.",1,1,1,0,0,0
Ritual32,"Funeral, banquet for the soul","A striking Serbian custom connected with death and burial is the series of commemorations of the departed at a common meal.

The first of these takes place on the day of burial. The next on the first Sunday following, the third is on the fortieth day, the fourth and fifth respectively at the half-year and the anniversary of the death. These are called “banquets for the soul.” They are preceded, of course, by a service in church, and outside the church refreshments are provided for all who come to the service.

The mourners then return home, where a friend of the family occupies the head of the table, and he calls upon the assembly to pray for the repose of their deceased friend’s soul, and for the living. He then offers an extempore prayer to this effect, and recalling the virtues of the deceased one. The company is then censed, and everyone partakes of a dish of boiled wheat which has been blessed by the priest with prayer and some wine poured over it. They also drink a little wine or brandy, served by the male members of the family. Then the actual meal begins. As a rule each guest brings some part of the food and drink with him, and the contribution of each guest is announced from the head of the table, God’s blessing being invoked upon the giver. Wailing on the part of the women is a regular feature of these “banquets for the soul.”

They are not usually held in the towns. But on the same five occasions in the year the town dwellers take all kinds of food and drink to the graves of their dead and there distribute them to beggars who crowd the graveyards in expectation of these gifts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual33,"""Buying back from the grave"" ritual","An extraordinary practice exists of “buying back from the grave.” If two members of a family happen to have been born in the same month of the year and one of them dies, it is believed that the other will die also within the year unless he is “bought back from the grave.” The living and the dead are chained together by the leg, and in that position the living one cries to a friend, “I pray thee in the name of God and St. John be my brother (or sister) and redeem the slave from the grave.” The friend replies that he will do so and unfastens the chain. The unchained person is then considered safe, and he and the one who “bought him back” are looked upon as brothers or sisters for the rest of their lives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual34,Slava ceremony,"The Slava

THE Slava is exclusively a Serbian custom. It is not found even among the Croats and Bulgars. There is a proverb which runs, “Where there is Slava, there is the Serb” (Gde je slava, tu je Srbin). Indeed, so distinctively Serbian is this custom that its observance is accepted by many as evidence of Serbian nationality among the disputed population of Macedonia.

Its significance is partly social, partly religious; and as a whole it is evidently a Christianized form of some ancient ceremony of pagan worship. Its Christian aspect finds its chief expression in reverence for and “glorification” (“slava” means “glory”) of the patron saint. In Serbia each family, not each individual person separately, has its patron saint, and every year, on that saint’s day, the family meets together to celebrate the slava. Or if that is impossible, each member of the family celebrates it, wherever he may be. Thus the family slava descends from generation to generation, and immense importance is attached to its observance.

It is a calamity if the slava should fail to be kept up owing to lack of descendants of the family. When a woman marries she adopts, naturally, the slava of her husband’s family.

The preparations for the slava begin some days before that of the actual ceremony. The priest goes to the house, blesses water, and with it sprinkles the house and its inmates. A more or less rigorous fast is observed sometimes for as long as a week. The house is scrupulously cleaned throughout, and the women and girls of the household are busy preparing sufficient food and drink and making the special dishes required for a slava. These consist of the “Kolatch” and the “Kolyivo” (or “Zhito”). The kolatch is a round flat cake something more than a foot in diameter and about three inches thick. It is stamped on its upper surface with a cross and sacred initials and monogram.

The kolyivo or zhito consists of well-boiled wheat grains [unavailable] up very fine with nuts and sugar. Here we have a Christian substitute for the old pagan sacrifice. The word kolyivo means something slain with a knife (for sacrifice), but the name has survived the change brought about by the Christian teaching that God does not require animal sacrifice, though He accepts the offering of the fruits of the earth to symbolize the oblation of the offerer’s self. That the wheat was originally an offering for the dead is indicated by the fact that at the slavas of St. Elias and St. Michael, who did not [unavailable] death, it is omitted from the composition of the zhito.

At last on the eve of the celebration all is ready, and a messenger is sent to summon the guests, for the Serb is nothing if not hospitable and sociable, and he delights to see as many of his friends as possible at his slava. Indeed, on the actual day of the slava, his house will be open to all, even to strangers. We are told that Turks, of all people, would sometimes be present at the slava of Kralyevitch Marko.

This message to the guests at the eleventh hour reminds one of the oriental custom of issuing a formal invitation some time before the occasion, and then summoning those who accepted by the message “all things are now ready,” as we read in the Gospel parable.

The guests are summoned in a stereotyped phrase of invitation, and accept (whether they really intend to come or not) similarly in a recognized formula. There is a good deal of this kind of formality. When the guest comes to the house, he will call to the head of the household, “Art thou willing to receive guests?” and the master of the house will hasten out to him replying, “By all means, and may I have many more like thee,” and so on.

The assembled visitors all wash their hands—as the Serbian peasant invariably does before taking food—and the slava ceremony begins. A wax candle is blessed with the sign of the cross, lighted, and placed in the middle of the table, stuck probably in the dish of zhito. Then the censer is brought in, and first the ikon and then each of the assembled company is censed, and finally the hostess censes the whole house. The master of the house, entitled for the occasion the “Svetchar,” invites the gathering to pray. If there is a priest present, of course he will bid them pray, and extempore prayers, often of great power and beauty, will be offered. The svetchar will end with a formal prayer for the occasion; it is addressed to God the Father and invokes the intercession of St. George, of the patron saint whose festival is being celebrated, and of the Apostles and Evangelists. Then they sit down to supper.

After the first meat has been partaken of, wine is served, and during supper seven toasts are drunk. The toasts proceed according to traditional formula, though the ritual varies somewhat in different parts of Serbia. In some places the principal guest proposes the first toast, in others it is proposed by the svetchar. The first toast is drunk “to the glory of God,” the second “to the better hour,” i.e. to the present hour which is “better” than good. The third is to the glory of the Trinity; and so forth.

The next morning, the day of the saint whose slava is being celebrated, the ceremonies are continued, first at church and afterwards at home. The kolyivo, the kolatch, some wine and the wax candle, are all taken to church and left in front of the altar during the Liturgy. After the service the priest reverses the cake, signs it with the cross, and sprinkles wine upon both it and the kolyivo in the same form. He then cuts the cake across the middle half-way through from the bottom upwards. Assisted by the svetchar, he holds the cake aloft, turning it slowly round and round during the saying or singing of certain prayers. Then the division of the cake is completed by breaking, and the two halies bent back upon each other. Holding the divided cake in this position the priest and the svetchar kiss it alternately three times, and after each time the cake is turned in their hands while the priest says, “Christ is in the midst of us,” and the assistant responds, “Now and for ever.”

If, as not infrequently happens, the nearest church is a long way away, the svetchar and his guests may perform all this part of the ceremony at home by themselves.

Part of the slava cake is placed upon the table for the midday meal which begins about noon. For this occasion there will be even more guests than came the evening before: and another series of toasts, both stereotyped and impromptu, will be gone through.

The whole of the day and perhaps of the day following also will be devoted to feasting and merrymaking. In olden times guests would stay on in the house prolonging the slava day after day until an empty wine barrel was rolled out into the courtyard, or an empty wine-skin flattened and folded was placed upon the table! This was a recognized signal which indicated that the host had no more hospitality to offer.

When the last of the guests has taken his leave, the candle is ceremonially extinguished with a few drops of wine, and the slava is over.

The slava is celebrated by other social units as well as by the family. Thus every regiment in the army has nowa-days its patron saint whose slava it observes annually. The trade guilds do the same, and the schools; the latter all have St. Sava as their patron, and of course every church has its slava. Similarly, every village has its own patron saint, and the observance of the slava of the whole village is known as the Zavetina.

On the outskirts of a Serbian village will be found a number of trees bearing a cross cut deep into the bark. These trees are considered sacred and must not be damaged in any way. Should they be of a fruit-bearing kind, the fruit is never gathered. Every year at the zavetina the trees are visited in solemn procession, and the crosses upon them are renewed. The procession is headed by a man carrying a large wooden cross. He is followed by the priest in full vestments bearing the Book of the Gospels, and behind the priest is a long double line of peasants with ikons which they carry against their breasts as we are accustomed to see the ministers carry the books at High Mass. The procession starts from the church, if there is one, otherwise from some agreed meeting-place. All this, however, happens only in the early summer. If the festival of the patron saint of the village falls between St. Peter’s Day and the following Easter, the zavetina is like an ordinary slava. One of the more well-to-do inhabitants provides the kolatch and the kolyivo, and generally acts as svetchar, while many of the others who come to join in the celebration bring contributions of wine and food to the banquet.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual35,Blessing of the Water,"Some Other Seasons

CHRISTMAS and Epiphany were originally one festival, the purpose of which was to commemorate the Birth of Christ. But different reckonings existed as to the date upon which this event took place and therefore of the day upon which it was to be commemorated. In the West, December the 25th was fixed upon, while in the East a different calculation arrived at January 6th, and out of this diversity grew two distinct festivals. After a while the East borrowed the Western feast of December 25th in addition to their own, and then the West took over January 6th from the East also. Thus we have in both East and West the two festivals as we know them, December 25th to commemorate the Birth of Christ, and January 6th upon which the commemorative emphasis varied. In the West it was concerned with the visit of the Wise Men and its spiritual significance, to which was added later the Baptism of Christ and the marriage at Cana—a threefold commemoration which we find now in our own Prayer Book. In the East, however, the emphasis of the Epiphany Festival was, and still is, upon the Baptism of Christ.

Hence on January 6th the beautiful ceremony of the “Blessing of the Water” takes place. Clergy and people go in procession to the nearest river, which of course is at this time of the year covered with ice. A fair-sized hole has been cut through the ice to the open water and a wooden platform erected to accommodate the principal persons present. A table has been prepared, and on it a cross and the image of a dove, all, both the table and its furnishings, being constructed of ice.

Here a service is held and the waters are blessed by the priest, who dips into it a silver cross. At the same time a number—perhaps a dozen—huge wooden bowls are filled with water, and this water is similarly blessed. From these bowls the people fill their bottles with the holy water, and this water, they say, keeps fresh for very long periods, long after other water becomes stagnant and stale.

The blessing of the water is always attended by large and [unavailable] crowds, and some of those present may be even so far carried away as to jump into the newly blessed river, clothed as they are and paying no heed to the temperature of the water.

It is a popular belief among the peasantry that at midnight of the Epiphany the heavens open for a moment or two for the “appearance of God”—which is the name of the festival in Serbian (Bogo Ya[unknown]olyenye). He who is fortunate enough to catch this moment will have granted any wish he may make at the time.",1,777,0,0,1,0
Ritual36,Death ritual (first formal offerings),"Minor Death Rituals

The first formal offerings for the dead coincide with the conclusion of their journey across the face of the earth, three or four days after death. The women of the household, sometimes with the help of their close female relatives, prepare boiled meat (usually goat, mutton, or chicken), beans, and other dishes like mustard greens and parched maize kernels, the latter ground either wet to produce kiorí (in Spanish esquiate ) or dry for kobísi (in Spanish pinole ). They also make small thick tortillas called “offering tortillas” ( rimé nutewá ), which are only about three inches in diameter and are prepared especially for the dead.  

On the appropriate day they place this food in containers outside the house next to a small cross, along with those possessions of the deceased that were not buried and other things that they want the dead person to have, like money. Usually only the members of the deceased’s household take part in this event, but at its end they pass the food through a juniper or cedar smudge and then distribute it among all the individuals who assisted in the burial except the deceased’s parents, children, siblings, and spouse.

The living are supposed to give a dead person food and other items three times (four for deceased females) in the three (four) years after this initial ritual and before they complete their obligations in one final fiesta. There is, however, considerable regional variation among the Rarámuri in the scheduling of these rituals (Lumholtz 1894: 444; Lumholtz 1902, I: 384 ff.; Bennett and Zingg 1935: 236 ff.). People may also put out offerings for the deceased at other times, whenever they have a fiesta or are troubled by the appearance of the dead in their dreams.

Bennett and Zingg (1935: 240-50) and Kennedy (1970b: 41; 1978: 152, 174) report that people who maintain a special joking relationship with a person during life are responsible for major portions of these death fiestas. Bennett and Zingg mention only the deceased’s siblings-in-law in this regard, while Kennedy includes both siblings-in-law and grandparents and grandchildren. He writes, “The general feeling seems to be that the joking relatives are the only ones who are not endangered by the power of the souls of the dead” (1970b: 41). In Rejogochi joking relations exist among these categories of kinsmen, but they have no unique duties to perform in death rituals. Instead the immediate family prepares the food and organizes the offerings and other events, although other relatives and friends may choose to give things to the dead. These rituals are community events and often occur in conjunction with the performance of other rituals or work projects. In addition to the food they prepare, the members of the sponsoring household brew maize beer to offer to the dead and to repay their guests for the assistance they provide in the completion of these tasks.

These small death rituals often are held for the benefit not only of the most recently deceased but of all close relatives who have died within the previous few years. Each dead person is represented in the rituals by a small wooden cross, called “cross of the dead” ( kúrasi anayáwari ). These crosses are placed together inside or adjacent to the homes where the rituals take place or, if a larger ceremony is being performed, on the dance patio near the crosses and offerings for God. Necklaces bearing crucifixes or carved crosses sometimes are hung from them. The dead are said to arrive at these crosses in the company of other relatives from the afterlife, who share the food and beer with them and help carry the goods back to their homes.

The offerings are arranged in front of these crosses, often on top of a blanket or plank but sometimes directly on the ground. A goat or sheep usually is slaughtered and its meat, after boiling for hours, is mashed with beans and mounded on top of the offering tortillas, which are then placed in baskets. These tortillas are supposed to be offered in multiples of three or four, depending on the gender of the deceased, but the number often varies because the Rarámuri are not particularly concerned with such details. With these tortillas are one or more bowls of meat stew, containers of liquid maize dishes ( kiorí and kobísi ), and, in season, ears of green maize. Sometimes cups of heavily sugared coffee also are included. The clothing and tools left behind by the deceased are placed next to these food offerings, together with other items the living want them to have. Containers of the ritual liquids so prominent in curing rituals—agave water and maize beer—also are present, as is a lighted candle if available.

A man who can communicate with the dead officiates at the formal presentation of the goods. He kneels before the crosses, sometimes touching the small crosses hanging from them, and crosses himself. He then takes in turn (although not necessarily in this order) the agave water, the beer, and the liquid foods and sprinkles them over the crosses, crossing himself after each offering. The agave water is applied to the crosses to cure the dead and to protect the living from them. The beer also cures the dead and is given, along with the liquid foods, for the dead to consume. Next he stands and offers each basket of food, the clothing, and the tools to the dead by lifting them toward heaven. He begins facing the crosses, then turns in the opposite direction, continuing in this way around the crosses, lifting the objects, crossing himself, and turning counterclockwise at each of the four sides. He concludes at the front facing the crosses and replaces the offerings in their original locations. Kneeling again, he sometimes drinks a bit of beer, then crosses himself, and stands.

Music is usually a part of this ritual. Almost always someone will play a violin and a few people may dance the shuffling steps of the paskóla . If the death ritual is part of a more complex ceremony, a chanter ( wikaráame ) or matachine dancers will perform. People say that the music and dances are beautiful and are intended to entertain the dead and make them content; they assume that the dead themselves often join in.

At the conclusion of the offerings, the other people present kneel in turn before the crosses, dripping agave water and beer over them and sipping bits of these liquids. In so doing, they simultaneously make offerings of these liquids to the dead, cure the dead, and protect themselves from them. Then the person in charge returns to the crosses, kneels, crosses himself, and makes a speech to the dead. He repeats the now familiar admonitions that the dead should be contented in their new existence and, because their needs have been provided for, should leave the living in peace. He ends by crossing himself and then hands the containers of food to a few of the people standing or sitting nearby to eat then. As in the previous rituals, close family members never eat this food.

After a period of general drinking, the person officiating distributes the remaining offerings among some of the people present and, carrying the small crosses ahead of him, leads them in a procession for a short distance toward the cemetery. The purpose of these processions is to escort the dead away from the domain of the living and toward their resting place in the cemetery and their final destination in heaven. Usually the participants first complete a circuit of the house and then wind their way around the homestead, to the accompaniment of musicians and sometimes dancers. Periodically they lift the items they are carrying heavenward and complete a tight counterclockwise turn to offer these goods to the dead. About thirty meters or so from the house, the leader stops, plants the crosses in the ground, and again offers the food and goods to the dead. He speaks a few words in parting to the dead and then tosses the crosses in the air toward the cemetery to send the dead on their way. The other members of the procession then drop what they are carrying to the ground, often collapsing themselves to signify that they too have died. Sometimes people will exaggerate their falls—for example, by turning somersaults—and everyone in the procession laughs. The processions, like the rituals of which they are a part, are not intended to be solemn.

After a few seconds the participants rise and gather around a bucket of maize beer that was carried in the procession, exchanging dippers among themselves until the supply is exhausted. Then they collect the items and return them to their owners, who use them as if they had never been offered to the dead. The rest of the fiesta is devoted to drinking and involves no special activities directed toward the deceased.

The general tone of these rituals is no different from that of other drinking get-togethers. People chat, dance, make jokes, and sometimes, when they are drunk, quarrel and fight. At the same time, the rituals provide the individuals closest to the deceased an opportunity to accept their grief and to enact their separation from the dead person in a context where they have the support of the larger community.

Occasionally the family members of the deceased express their emotions overtly during these rituals. I recall in particular a death ritual held in Rejogochi in September of 1978. The ritual was sponsored for two members of the Rejogochi community: a girl about five years old and her classificatory grandfather, who was about seventy years old. Both had died several months before in the Jesuit clinic in Creel—the man from a lingering illness apparently due to his advanced age, the girl from meningitis—and both had been buried in Creel. Because of the danger of contagion, the girl had been buried immediately, before her parents had time to get to Creel to view the body. They were not entirely convinced that she had died and had heard rumors that she had been taken to a Jesuit school in the mission center of Sisoguichi. In fact, one man from the Basíhuare area said he had seen her there.

The girl’s parents and the man’s widow jointly organized the ritual. Their emotional states during its performance were quite similar and perhaps best described as volatile. For most of the time they acted like the other people present, but sometimes they would begin to weep. After crying briefly, they would abruptly stop to start talking and joking with the people around them, shifting with little transition from subdued weeping to boisterous laughter. At these times, other people would bring them beer to drink and encourage them to have strength and not to become dishertened.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Ritual37,"Final death ceremony (""When we write with ashes"")","""When We Write with Ashes""

The final death fiesta is more elaborate than any of the previous ones and ideally should be given at least three years (four years for females) after death but not before the other, smaller fiestas have been performed. Although the smaller death rituals can be held at any time of the year, the final death rituals, like those for bakánawi and peyote, are never staged during the maize growing season. The only explanation the Rarámuri offer for this restriction is that holding these ceremonies before the maize is mature would anger God who would destroy their crops. Because of the expense, poorer households often delay sponsoring these fiestas for many years, despite the risks from the dead.

The dead present the greatest danger to the living in this interim period. They are said to remain near their living relatives until the completion of this ritual and will punish them by making them ill or taking the souls of their children if they feel forgotten. To avoid sad memories, people dispose of the possessions of the deceased during this time, selling them or giving or throwing them away. They also distribute the dead person’s land, animals, and stores of maize among his or her children or grandchildren or, if none of these heirs survive, to his or her siblings and other collateral relations. A spouse inherits only if the deceased has no other relatives in the community. This distribution is supervised by the president of the section, the local representative of the national government, who is supposed to resolve conflicts over the inheritance.

The final death ritual includes all of the features found in the three (or four) rituals that precede it along with several unique elements. The purpose of all these rituals is to protect the living from the dead and to provide the dead with the food and other items they require. Unlike the simpler rituals, however, the final fiesta is intended to fulfill conclusively the obligations of the living to the dead and to effect a complete separation of the dead from the living. In it, elements from various domains—social, political, religious, and economic—are combined to create a representation of Rarámuri life, which is adapted on each occasion to reflect the gender or personal interests of the deceased. These rituals thereby provide the dead (and thus the living) with an image of their life and society and a final opportunity to participate in it before they are sent away to the afterlife.

The Rarámuri call these elaborate fiestas napisó osiwáchi (when we write with ashes) because near the end of the ritual everyone present gathers to cross their foreheads with ashes for protection from the dead. They also scatter ashes around the homestead to prevent the dead from returning to harm them or their animals. In addition, during these rituals and on other occasions, they draw lines or crosses with ashes on the outside of their beer ollas, often sprinkling ashes on the ground around the ollas. These measures are intended to keep the dead from breaking the ollas or drinking the beer (that is, its invisible parallel aspect, which is associated with its aroma and sometimes its potency). If people drink beer contaminated by the dead, they will fall ill, typically with upset stomachs, unless they have taken the precaution of sipping agave water or sprinkling it into the beer.

Ashes produced from the bark of a local juniper ( awarí ) are preferred for these purposes because they are of a lighter color than those derived from other materials. When I asked why the color of the ashes is significant, people responded only that whiter ashes were more attractive, and when I inquired why ashes in general are employed to protect the living from the dead, they replied simply that the dead are afraid of ashes. It is possible that ashes were selected to perform this role because they represent the ultimate remains of organic (that is, animate) things and thus maintain a structural correspondence with the dead. However, the ritual application of ashes in the napisó fiesta also bears a number of similarities to the Catholic ritual of Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent, in which crosses are drawn on the foreheads of the members of the congregation. These correspondences suggest that the Rarámuri derived this component of the napisó ritual and possibly the symbolic association between ashes and the dead as well directly from Catholic missionaries.

That the Rarámuri were exposed to the Ash Wednesday ritual and its significance early in the colonial period is documented in a 1676 account of the religious instruction provided to converts in two missions located in the eastern portions of Rarámuri territory:

On Ash Wednesday, all the people from each of these two missions assembled where the priests lectured them, explaining what Easter was and the obligations they had as Christians.
Because they are such barbarous people, they seemed to have concluded that putting ashes on them was something related to their drinking bouts. They are accustomed to paint themselves with earth in the manner of ashes, and perhaps because they usually paint some figures, they concluded that painting crosses on their faces was done for them to become intoxicated, for it is a sign of a fiesta to paint oneself with dirt. All of this appears to impede the fruit of penitence that is hoped from so sacred a ceremony. . . .
The word of God overcame all of these challenges because it was explained to them with much distinction the significance of ashes. They were told as on other occasions of the body and the soul, that as they worked for the good of the body, suffering and wanting many things, so should they work for their souls, suffering and wanting for their sins. That the sign of the cross which was painted on their foreheads that day signified all that Our Lord suffered for us, even to dying on the cross. And with the ashes it is signified that our bodies will return to ashes and that all the desires of this life will be extinguished (Tardá and Guadalaxara 1676: 378v).

I attended three napisó rituals in the Rejogochi area, one in November of 1977 and two in March of 1978. All three performances included the same basic components, but rather than present a generalized summary of them, I will recount the events of the one staged on March 7, 1978, for which I have the most detailed description and explanation.

The ritual was sponsored for a man named San Pedro who died in his early thirties about four years before, apparently from the tuberculosis that is endemic among the Rarámuri. Although the Rarámuri encourage surviving spouses to remarry as soon as possible after a death, San Pedro’s widow, Dolores, resisted attempts to provide her with a new husband. After San Pedro’s death, she moved back to her natal rancho of Waéachi a few kilometers away, and returned to Rejogochi for the napisó ritual.

The ritual was held at San Pedro’s former home and was organized primarily by his mother and stepfather, with the assistance of San Pedro’s mother’s sister, who was married to one of Dolores’s cousins. San Pedro’s sister and her husband and San Pedro’s half-siblings with their spouses also helped. Together they supplied two goats, one sheep, four chickens, and the maize from which about four hundred liters of beer and large quantities of tortillas, tamales, and other maize dishes were prepared. Dolores in turn provided a cow that had belonged to San Pedro, which she had kept especially to be killed on this occasion.

Major preparations for the fiesta got under way on March 6. In the morning four of Dolores’s male relatives arrived from Waéachi to deliver the cow to be sacrificed and to help the men of San Pedro’s family slaughter it. After it was butchered, Lorenzo, who was both Dolores’s cousin and the late San Pedro’s uncle by marriage, distributed choice cuts among the men who were helping. The men also cleared a patio and erected a wooden cross about four feet tall in front of which they killed the goats and sheep and later offered food to God. The meat and blood was turned over to the women, who spent most of the day cooking the blood, grinding maize, making tortillas and tamales, and seeing that the beer was fermenting properly.

That night, a metal oil drum, cut in half, was filled with meat and water and set to simmer. About the same time, a chanter ( wikaráame ) began shaking a gourd rattle and intoning the lines of the tutubúri ritual, moving back and forth across the patio in front of two crosses where the goats and sheep had been sacrificed. He continued all night long, stopping only briefly at intervals to rest, in preparation for the offering of food to God the next day.

Soon after dawn, San Pedro’s family dispatched Mariano Sikóchi, a man about forty-five years old who could communicate with the dead, to the cemetery in Basíhuare where San Pedro was buried. His errand was to invite San Pedro and other deceased relatives of the people sponsoring the ritual to come to the fiesta. They gave him the names of nine people—four males and five females, and mostly children—so he could invite them specifically, but they assumed that the souls of other dead people would arrive as well. They gave him a small wooden cross to carry before him as he walked and a gallon jug of beer and some ground parched maize to share with the dead. A younger man, Mauricio González, went along to help him carry the beer on the twenty kilometer roundtrip.

By midmorning most people had arrived at the fiesta, over a hundred people in all. The women joined in preparing food while the men completed or watched the ritual performances. These ritual activities took place on two separate dance patios. On the first, prepared the day before, white muslin cloths were draped over two crosses, and a necklace made of Job’s-tears seeds and bearing a small wooden cross was hung over the cloth on the taller of the two. These crosses, oriented toward the rising sun, were designated as God’s; the chanter, whose function was to elicit God’s goodwill, performed around them. A third cross, like the other two around four feet tall and similarly oriented, had been erected about two meters from them to the north. This was designated as the cross of the matachine dancers, and five small wooden crosses, representing the dead, stood around its base. A bench for the violinists and guitarist who would accompany the matachines was set up along the back edge of the patio in front of this cross.

A second patio was prepared about ten yards southeast of the main patio. Instead of crosses its central feature was a platform formed of planks resting about five feet above the ground on the near horizontal branches of two otherwise trimmed pine saplings. This raised platform, around which the major offerings for the dead were to be placed, is called nutegátili (offering place) and is built only for napisó rituals. I originally assumed that the offerings are elevated much higher in this ritual than in others because the purpose is to provision the dead for a journey to heaven. However, the Rarámuri I questioned never offered this interpretation, stating only that this sort of platform has always been used in these rituals.

The chanter continued his performance with short breaks until around 11:00 A.M. when containers of meat stew and ground parched maize mixed with water were placed in front of the crosses for God and the dead. A plastic bucket of maize beer stood next to the crosses for the dead. About this time, a man emerged from the trees above the house, where he had changed into his matachine costume. This elaborate costume consisted of a number of components, most of which are not used in everyday dress: a “crown” constructed of a metal box made from four mirrors with crepe paper streamers hanging down the back and a kerchief attached to the sides that concealed the dancer’s chin; a white headband; a cape formed of two brightly colored strips of cloth attached at the shoulders to the dancer’s long-sleeved shirt; white muslin pants extending just below the knees; a triangular “apron” consisting of a kerchief placed on top of a slightly larger piece of white muslin and held in place by a woven wool belt; knee socks; and work boots, each carrying a string of metal bells. The dancer also carried as part of his costume a wand made of a bent sapling decorated with red and blue crepe paper and a rattle made of wood shavings glued together around a wooden handle topped by a small wooden cross. While dancing he shook the rattle in his right hand while holding the wand in his left. He was joined by another dancer who did not wear a costume but had a rattle of the same type and some corn husks instead of the wand. The musicians who would accompany them assembled along the back of the patio and began tuning their instruments.

The matachines then started to perform in front of their cross in preparation for the offering of food to God. Because the fiesta was sponsored for a man, they danced in sets of three pieces each before taking a break; had the principal deceased been female, each set would have included four pieces. The chanter resumed his own dance beside them, and another man began playing a flute to an entirely different tune next to the matachines’ musicians. The juxtaposition of tutubúri and matachine is typical during such fiestas, but flutes and their companion instruments, large snared drums, are used only during the Easter season. Drums and flutes accompany the dances of the Pharisees and Soldiers, the two groups responsible for the organization of the Easter activities, but representatives of these groups did not perform until later in the day.

Three men approached the crosses of God, and all the other men stood and removed their hats. The three lifted the containers of food up toward heaven in offering to God and then placed them at the opposite edge of the patio. San Pedro’s stepfather called the men to eat, beginning with the performers and those who had helped prepare the fiesta and then the others.

When all had eaten, food and beer were offered to the dead. Lirio, a Rejogochi man who had been asked by San Pedro’s family to lead the death ritual, knelt in front of the crosses of the dead, crossed himself, spoke a few words in a very low voice, and sprinkled small amounts of the food and beer over the crosses. Then he tossed beer to the four directions and ate some of the food, next calling the matachine group to eat. All the men gathered at the crosses to exchange gourd dippers of beer while the chanter and matachines resumed their dances. A woman left the other women to dance beside the chanter for a few pieces.  

About 2:00 P.M., Mariano and Mauricio came from the cemetery, Mariano in front carrying the small cross, Mauricio behind him with the empty beer jug, both men quite drunk. They went directly to the patio and walked clockwise twice around both sets of crosses. Mariano then placed the small cross among the others, and he and Mauricio completed three more clockwise circuits of the crosses before joining the other men in drinking.

Because people in Rejogochi usually circle the crosses counterclockwise, I later asked Mariano and others why he had moved clockwise here. Mariano explained that in his home pueblo of Samachique, many such movements are reversed in death rituals. Bennett and Zingg (1935: 251), who worked in Samachique around 1930, observed reversals in death rituals there, attributing them to the belief that the world of the dead is a reversal of that of the living. Natives of Rejogochi, however, rejected this explanation, characterizing Mariano’s actions as drunken mistakes.

With the appearance of Mariano and Mauricio, the level of activity increased dramatically, for the dead were said to have arrived with them. The women completed the final food preparations for the major offerings to God and the dead. The food was placed in front of God’s crosses and on the raised platform below rather than at the small crosses on the patio. By this time, other items to be given to the dead had been arranged on and around the platform. These goods are supposed to include all that the dead require to establish themselves in the afterlife. On this occasion they consisted of clothing, wool, cloth, blankets, some coins, necklaces, a hoe, a metal plow point, a chisel, an oxen yoke, an axe, a few ears of maize in a sack, and two wooden balls and two sets of sticks and hoops for men’s and women’s footraces. Two ollas of maize beer stood in the center underneath the platform with a candle next to each.

The Pharisees and Soldiers began dancing on the patio in front of the matachine cross, alternating with the matachines. Two men and two women retrieved the racing balls and sticks-and-hoops from underneath the raised platform and simulated racing by walking around the platform and the crosses on the patio before heading up the valley at full pace. Although such races were staged during all three napisó rituals I attended, I was told that they were held on this occasion because San Pedro had been an accomplished racer and that he and other of the dead ran along with the living during them.

As the racers were leaving, a man appeared at the patio from the nearby creek carrying a can of the Pharisees’ white paint, a mixture of clay and water, with which he coated the legs, arms, and faces of several of the men, including the four who had been appointed as the leading Pharisees for the year. Moreno picked up the small crosses from the patio and led the matachines, Pharisees, Soldiers, and musicians, all performing, first to the platform, where he stuck the crosses into the ground underneath, and then inside the house where the application of ashes would later take place. The chanter resumed his dance on the patio as the racers passed on their way down the valley.

Soon after the racers completed their brief contest and returned their equipment to the platform, final food offerings to God were made. The two doctors who were directing the ritual—Lirio and Mariano—formed a line with their wives across the back of the patio, facing the matachine cross, while the matachines danced. The chanter stood a few feet below them in front of the crosses of God, shaking his rattle. Five men approached these crosses and circled them counterclockwise, with one of the men tossing out agave water to the four directions to protect the living from the dead. Lirio, together with his wife Rosario, Mariano, and Mariano’s wife María Elena led the matachines around the patio and down by the platform where the Pharisees and Soldiers were dancing. Then the group moved on to the house.

Back at the patio, the five men offered the food to God while the chanter performed, and then each sipped some of the agave water before passing it on to the other men present. They drank this to avoid sickness that would result from consuming food and beer possibly contaminated by the dead. This food was then divided among the chanter and other performers and what remained was returned to the women for general distribution.

At the conclusion of these offerings, the focus of the ritual shifted from God to the dead. Drinking had begun from ollas inside the house where people were assembling for the ritual application of ashes. Three walls of this house were made of pine logs interlocked as for a log cabin, while the fourth, on the north side, was formed by hand-hewn pine planks leaned against the roof. Some of these planks had been removed from either end of this wall to create two entrances, one on the east for women, one on the west for men. Lirio and Mariano sat opposite the men’s entrance, their wives, Rosario and María Elena, opposite the women’s. Next to each pair was arranged the articles to be used in the ritual: an olla of beer; a gourd dipper; a bucket containing three (for males) or four (for females) dippersful of beer for each of the dead for whom the fiesta had been sponsored; a small wooden cross with a lighted candle next to it; a can of water with a pine needle brush in it; and a dish of ashes. To protect the beer from contamination by the dead, Lirio and Rosario drew crosses with ashes on the sides of the ollas next to them, eight crosses on the men’s olla, seven on the women’s. Then Lirio, Mariano, Rosario, and María Elena individually traced the outline of a cross on their foreheads and splashed water with the pine needle brushes on their partner’s head, back, and chest.

The other people present began lining up for the ritual, the men entering the house through the western opening, the women through the eastern. They knelt in turn, crossed themselves, and made crosses on their foreheads with the ashes. Lirio (for the males) or Rosario (for the females) then struck them lightly at the appropriate spots of their bodies with the pine needle brushes dipped in water, and Mariano (males) or María Elena (females) drew out some beer from the ollas for them to drink. The ashes and water were intended to repel the dead, and the beer was drunk to fortify the living against the dangers of contact with the dead. After drinking the beer, they crossed themselves again, and left. Some people took a pinch of ashes with them to scatter outside the house to prevent the dead from entering. Throughout this period, the matachines performed at the platform and inside the house while a drum and two flutes played outside.

When everyone had completed this ritual, they continued drinking inside the house. Then Mariano emerged from the men’s entrance with a dish of ashes and María Elena from the women’s with a can of water and a pine needle brush. Walking in opposite directions, they scattered ashes and water around the house to create a barrier against the dead and then reentered through the same openings from which they had exited. About the same time, the matachines moved to the raised platform to dance and preparations were begun for the procession that would conclude the ceremony.

San Pedro’s stepfather and stepbrother entered the house and emerged a minute or so later, carrying a white sheet between them. The two small crosses that had been used in the ashes ritual rested inside. Following them were Mariano with a dish of ashes, María Elena with a can of water and pine needle brush, and another couple carrying the buckets of maize beer that had been set apart for the dead during the ritual application of ashes. They all moved to the platform, where Lirio and Rosario stood, the latter with a basket of meat and tortillas she had taken from the platform. They lowered the sheet to the ground in front of the platform and placed the small crosses and candles there with the other crosses. Lirio took bits of meat and tortillas from the basket held by his wife and dropped them over the crosses inside the sheet. He then dipped out small amounts of maize beer from one of the buckets and the two ollas under the platform and sprinkled it over the crosses. Then the sheet was carried counterclockwise around to the back of the platform, where Lirio repeated the offerings.

The procession next moved up to the other patio. San Pedro’s 1 and stepbrother led the way with the sheet while his mother and widow walked to either side. Lirio followed the sheet, singing and talking to the crosses—that is, to the dead—telling them to return contentedly to their homes, that they would receive nothing else from the living, and to leave the living in peace. Rosario followed Lirio with the basket of food and was in turn followed by Mariano and María Elena with the ashes and water, then by the couple bearing the buckets of 2, the matachines, the Pharisees and Soldiers, and the musicians. The two pairs of racers circled the procession in opposite directions, as if they were competing.

When they arrived at the patio, the members of the procession halted first in front of the crosses designated as God’s and again behind them, where Lirio sprinkled bits of food and drops of beer over the crosses inside the sheet. Then they returned to the raised platform where Lirio handed the items remaining there to other people, who joined the procession. San Pedro’s stepfather removed the metal plow point and chisel from the platform and stored them inside his house so that they would not be lost. His wife took his place carrying the sheet.

To separate the dead from the domain of the living, the procession moved down the hill away from the house in the direction of the cemetery. At the bottom, they laid the sheet on the ground, Lirio spoke a few words of parting to the dead, and ordered the sheet to be lifted and the crosses tossed into the air to send the dead on their way. At the same time, people dropped the items to the ground, a few fell to the ground themselves, and Mariano exclaimed, “The dead are going home.” Then everyone assembled around the buckets of beer to drink.

By now the sun had set and a fire had been lit next to the platform. A few drops of rain began to fall, unusual for this time of year. When they finished the beer from the buckets, the members of the procession hurriedly gathered the items they had carried and returned to the platform to continue drinking with the 1 for the rest of the night.

Ritual38,Curing ritual including yumari dance,"Curing Rituals

Among the gentiles all major rituals are carried out at the level of the rancho; there is no central location which serves as a community center for ceremonial or other group activities. This contrasts strikingly with the bautizados, who gather in their pueblo centers, each of which is oriented around an old Jesuit church. The bautizados not only hold their political meetings in these community centers, but also have fairly elaborate ceremonial complexes centering around the Spanish-introduced fiesta periods of Christmas and Easter. The gentiles, having overtly rejected Catholicism, lack the matachíne and pascola dancers which are major features of bautizado ceremonials. On the other hand, the bautizados still retain the equivalent aboriginal rituals which constitute a compartmentalized system for them which is parallel to their own more colorful Catholic-derived practices.

As stated earlier, the rituals of the gentiles center around the concept of curing. Everything of importance, from crops to animals and people, must be cured annually to prevent harm from befalling it. As people or animals who are sick must be so treated, fields which are not yielding properly must also be cured as an alleviative measure. This does not mean that practical means of agriculture and health are not also carried out to the extent they are known and believed in. It only means that ritual is an integral part of practical affairs. Just as a man plants seeds and hoes the corn, he also performs the appropriate rituals to protect his crops as part of the cultural repertoire of normal activities.

Curing rituals are usually performed on a specially cleared spot which is found nearby any Tarahumara dwelling. This place is called a dance patio by former students of this group, and awírachi by the Tarahumara. It may be round or squared off, and is generally between 15 or 20 feet to 30 or 40 feet across, depending upon the amount of space available. Actually, an awírachi is simply a cleared area which is fairly level. The awírachi is the place upon which the animal whose flesh is to be served later at the feast is sacrificed. On the awírachi ritual dancing is performed and ceremonies initiated. Thus, it is a sacred place during the time it is being used; at other times it is treated like any other part of the living area.

At the eastern edge of this dance patio a ceremonial table or wooden altar is set up. The alters or tables always face westward and vary somewhat in appearance, though they are usually from four to six feet long and about two feet across. Such altars are generally two and one half to three feet high, and may be fixed in one place by having their four legs set into the ground. Affixed to the east side of the altar are three crosses rising another three feet or so above the table. During ceremonials the crosses are draped with white muslin cloth which is tied about eight inches from the top. Often these figures are also decorated with strings of beads. When thus draped and blown by the wind, the crosses give the appearance of human figures. Lumholtz (1902:172-174) claimed that the crosses represented the Father Sun, Mother, and Morning Star, the three major aboriginal deities, but in Inápuchi these concepts were not known. My informants said that the crosses are erected because Onorúame ordered it that way for his dances.

The altar serves as a table of offerings to Onorúame. For all important ceremonies it is stocked with baskets and bowls of pinole, tortillas and tamales, and flavored boiled meat from the animal. Everything prepared for the occasion, and which is to be later eaten during the feast (the tónari ), has to put here for several hours so that Onorúame may partake of the essence or smell of it before it is consumed by people. Behind the table, on the east side, are placed the jars of tesgúino which will be drunk.

Underneath the table to one side is placed a broken piece of pottery on which a few peach pits or other bits of refuse are placed, and beside this, stuck into the ground, are one or more tiny crosses (from eight inches to one foot high). This worthless offering is for Diablo (or sometimes it is said, for the fox spirit), to keep him from getting up and interfering with the sacrificial food for onorúame. This offering is also said to prevent sickness. When the regular tónari food is removed from the large altar after the ceremony, a hole is quickly dug, and with a short incantation the worthless Diablo food is buried. Under the sacrificial table are also placed the “medicines” which have been collected for various curing purposes, and which will be taken out and used during this ceremony.

When everything has been arranged for a curing ritual, the most important sacred activity which then must be enacted is the dancing. In the Inápuchi-Aboreáchi area the most important sacred dance is called the yúmari, a serious form of ritual work performed by the sawéames . Later in the ceremony before the feasting begins the tempo becomes quicker, and young men and women participate in dancing. This is called the tutubúri .

The sawéames are nearly always among the older men in the area, though I have seen a younger man dancing yúmari for a small field-curing ritual to which few people came. My informants described the requisites as upright character and lack of “shame” (which means one who is not afraid or “ashamed” to stand up and speak in the presence of a group).

Yúmari is usually danced for many hours by two or three sawéames . They begin by having a ceremonial rattle presented to them by an owerúame as they stand on one side of the dance patio. They are dressed in clean muslin clothing and have a blanket draped over their left shoulder, leaving free the arm with the rattle. One of the sawéames makes a short speech and they start chanting in rhythm with their rattles. After a few moments of this they solemnly cross the patio, their steps in time with the chant. On reaching a position in front of the ceremonial table the sawéames face west, humming, and again chant and dance in place for several minutes before again crossing to the other side of this patio. All of my informants claimed that the occasional words interspersed within the monotone humming have no meaning. They were given by Onorúame for this dance.

The sawéames often dance alone for hours through the night, taking only brief rests. Occasionally they may only dance for two or three hours while a feast is being prepared. In the bautizado areas colorful matachíne dancers move to the music of violins and guitars on one side of the dance patio, while the yúmari or tutubúri dancers move on the other. In the gentile area there are no matachínes . The rattle is the only instrument used during the yúmari here, though the violin is played for the parade of the young men through the new corn during field-curing ceremonies. The yúmari is an arduous and serious form of ceremonial labor, and it is believed that the dancers need help from time to time. Thus, all men have an obligation to line up and dance back and forth across the dance patio several times with the sawéames at some point during the proceedings.

The other dance, the tutubúri is similar in many ways to the yúmari, but it is much more animated and involves more people. This is danced for a half hour or so prior to concluding the dancing part of a fiesta. The joyful tutubúri is a dance in which the women participate. The men’s part in it is much the same as in the yúmari, since they simply line up beside the sawéames and follow them as they cross the dance patio. The pace of the tutubúri is quicker and the mood is one of laughing and joking. For their part in it the women join hands and form a line on the opposite side of the patio from the men. They are generally barefoot and they take short quick hopping steps to the time of the sawéame’s rattle. Instead of facing the men and dancing toward them, their line moves back and forth in front of them from north to south. Then when the men move to the opposite side of the awírachi, the line of women dances around the patio in a counterclockwise line, so that it again can be in front of the line of men, who are now facing in the opposite direction. In Inápuchi, occasionally three or four women dance the tutubúri in a whirling circle in the center of the patio, laughing all the while, as the men look on smiling (see plate # 26).

Other “medicines” used in curing rituals are certain fairly common substances in the environment which boys are sent out to collect before important ceremonial events. Sometimes they must make trips of a day or two down in the barranca to assure that all the required materials are present. Many of the “medicines” may be used individually by an owerúame in ministering to a sick person, but a whole series of them is collected in bowls for large scale ceremonies to “cure” the fields and animals.

Among the medicines identified by informants are parts of two varieties of maguey, chilipiquíns, ashes, red clay, powdered stone containing salty mineral, esquiáte, the bark of the ash tree, and a number of plants, including chuchupáte, which is otherwise used to stupefy fish. A similar list is reported in Bennett and Zingg.

All of these “medicines” were said to work together for the prevention of sickness to people or harm to the crops, although they are not all used in every ceremony. They are all relatively ordinary substances, but several of them have stimulus qualities which create a physical effect, for example, the intoxicating power of tesgúino, the burning sensation of the chilipiquín, the saltiness of the goyáka, the numbing effect of the chuchupáte, and the redness of the clay. The reasons for the inclusion of ordinary foods such as méki and esquiáte are not so clear, especially since other common foods like pinole or beans are not included.

Curing ceremonies feature a general pattern of symbolic gestures. The principal movements, usually performed by an owerúame and then sometimes repeated by the others, are the gestures and offerings to the four directions (sometimes, as in tesgüino dedication, followed by a gesture upwards to the sky), the counterclockwise circles made by lines of men, and the counterclockwise turnings of the body in patterns of three or four. The other standardized ritual movement is the marking of crosses in the air with smoke, tesgüino, or “medicines.”

The cross may have been a pre-Spanish Indian symbol since the form was widely used in pre-Columbian Mexico; if it was present, Catholic influence strengthened and perpetuated its ceremonial importance. As a form it permeates Tarahumara ritual, and even in the most remote areas a few men own rather elaborate crucifixes which have been purchased at mestizo stores. Wooden crosses of all sizes are used in many ceremonials, and sometimes large log crosses are laid in the fields to prevent hail. Tiny crosses are set in the fields to prevent Diablo from harming the crops.

Sympathetic magic is clearly part of the religious thinking here. For rain-calling ceremonies, several minnows in half gourds of water are set on or near the ceremonial table, and several worms are put there for the rituals petitioning the worms not to eat the corn. Being struck by lightning is a real hazard in the sierra and the owerúame annually defends against it by a dramatic ritual. Lining the people up, he takes long burning sticks of pitch pine to make flaming crosses in the air above the head of each, and then outlines each person with fire.",0,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual39,Peyote ceremony,"Shamans and the Peyote Fiesta

The peyote shamans are the most powerful of all. Although they can cure fields and people and conduct ceremonies like other shamans, their specialty is the peyote cure. It is a cure which is accompanied by a large fiesta. In times of poor crops and little corn, very few of these are given, and so the shamans may be forced to practice more simple cures. In normal times, however, a good peyotero can devote full time to his specialty. The shaman Habrán was continually being called to all parts of the sierra to work his peyote cures. Many people would even come to consult him about minor ailments because his wisdom was respected so highly.

To give a peyote fiesta, in the cure of some sick person, tesgüino is made, a cow sacrificed, and lots of food prepared. As in other native fiestas, the dutubúri is danced on a patio that has three crosses. Matachines may also be danced in front of a special cross. At some distance to one side, there is a special patio for the peyote dance ( híkuli nawikébo ). Two crosses are placed here, one beside the jar containing the peyote, and one for God. Peyote is not dedicated to the four directions but is merely put in front of the two crosses for a time. At this patio for peyote, there is a hole into which one must spit and throw old cigarette butts. One must remove his hat and cross himself on approaching the patio . And one must ask permission to leave it. A quarter of beef is placed here, with all vitals included. The peyotero takes this beef in the end, in payment for his services. A big fire, around which the peyote dancers move, burns all night on the patio .

After dusk, the dancing ceases and everyone present eats a bit of peyote (it is dry and served ground up and mixed with water). Then they drink a little tesgüino . All night long they are drunk from the effects of the peyote, although they do not eat it again. If any remains, the special dancers finish it in the morning.

After the eating of the peyote, the shaman rasps with his notched stick for awhile. A circle or hole marked with a cross is made, into which peyote is placed and covered with a bowl, calabash, or small olla. The end of the notched stick is then placed on the overturned container and scraped with another stick. The container gives resonance to the rasping. The rasping sticks are made from wood which grows in the peyote country. On the trips to obtain peyote, one of these sticks is made and brought back. It is considered dangerous to bring back more than one at a time. Only shamans keep them in their possession, since the layman would be in danger of death should he keep one.

The shaman has two assistants who help him pass out the peyote and who lead the dancers to the peyote patio for the dance. About ten people dance, male and female. The assistants lead the women to the patio, and the men follow. They dance around the fire to the tune of the violin and guitar. The shaman himself dances at times, and at other times provides rasping music—although some shamans are content to let the stringed instruments serve as the only music. The dance around the fire is enlivened by slapping the mouth with the hand and shouting. The dutubúri and the matachines are the danced at the same time.

In the morning the dancing ceases. Food is served, and the tesgüino is dedicated. All the people eat before the shaman eats. Now the time has come to start the curing of the sick person. This may be done in various ways. The most common is that of marking crosses on the body with a crucifix dipped in tesgüino, while the shaman rasps and sings. At the end of the ceremony, the rasping stick is scraped over the head of the sick person or over the heads of all those to be cured, three times. Curative properties are attributed to the peyote as well as to the rasping stick. The patient has been served peyote along with the others. It is thought that during the night of dancing the peyote speaks words of encouragement and sings songs to him. To complete the curing, the shaman faces the sun and makes movements above and below the notched stick with the other stick. He repeats this three times. Everyone present drinks a bit of mixture (mescal in water; cf. p. 164) as a general protective measure. Then they all wash their faces and hands.

Medicinal Properties

Peyote is considered a cure for many diseases and is believed to have medicinal properties. It is applied externally as an ointment (ground on a metate or chewed) for bruises, snake bites, rheumatism, and other afflictions. Peyote is the ultimate cure when all others have failed. The sickness which results from touching or breaking the plant dekúba can only be cured with peyote. Other diseases, too, will yield to peyote while remaining adamant to other cures.

Thus, the use of peyote resembles an elaborate curing ceremony rather than a cult. There is nothing to suggest a society centered around peyote-eating, in spite of the fact that it is not universally used. The group of peyote-eaters does not involve any exclusiveness, requirements, or ritual pertaining to individuals. The peyote ceremonies are not given for the pleasure of eating the plant, but to cure some disease. The peyoteros are shamans who possess knowledge of other cures, but believe and practice the peyote cure as well. In accordance with its medicinal properties is the belief that after four years it serves no longer and must be hidden away or returned to its original home.

That peyote is considered the most powerful of plants is clearly evident. Lumholtz (see p. 360) identifies it as one of the gods. The treatment of peyote is elaborate in Tarahumara culture, but not exclusive, for other plants are also treated with special respect, even though it is on a smaller scale (see p. 347). Although the peyote fiesta has a somewhat distinctive appearance, it is like all other important cures which involve a special ceremony (cf. chap. xix).",0,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual40,Church Fiesta of Guadalupe,"Guadalupe Fiesta

The following paragraphs describe the fiesta of Guadalupe as it was performed in Samachique in 1930. In the main, it is a typical fiesta, not only for Samachique but for the sierra as a whole.

During the four or five days which preceded the twelfth of December, the people began to come into the pueblo of Samachique. They occupied the stone houses clustered in the hills near the church. All day long, there was activity—the women grinding corn for tesgüino, pinoli, and tortillas; the men chopping wood; the children watching the herds. The gobernador moved here and there, conferring with the other officials.

On the eleventh, the fiesteros arrived with hoes and cleared off the churchyard, taking special care to smooth the dance space for the matachines . All the Indians who visited the church were remarkably clean. They had their hair nicely combed, and their shirts and breechcloths washed. Some had their legs painted in stripes and had dabs of white paint on their faces.

At the house of each fiestero, a patio was made. The Indians scraped the ground with a hoe, forming a circular space about 14 feet in diameter. At the east side of this patio a cross was erected and a box or crate placed in front of it for a table. A rosary was hung from the cross.

All the fiesteros brought the cow to the patio . Its feet were tied together, and it was thrown on its side on the patio . A rope was looped under the tail and around the nose. The head was drawn way back. The cross, the four directions, and the four sides of the cow were smoked with incense. A line of smoke was made above the animal. (Sometimes the rattle is used in the same manner also.) The fiestero whose animal is being killed does the smoking.

The ground was now scraped out beneath the forelegs of the animal, and a wooden bowl placed there to catch the blood. While several men held the animal, an old man who had had experience in the manner (though not a doctor) pierced the jugular vein with a knife. As the wooden bowl filled with blood, a girl dipped it into an olla. The old man was now handed a wooden spoon. He tossed three small dippers of blood toward the cross, three away from it, three to the left, three to the right, and then one toward heaven above. The blood was taken by the women to be cooked.

The cow was now dragged off the patio, and the skinning began. The left foreleg was removed and then the tenderloin along the vertebrae. The tip of the tail was preserved to make string. The belly was slit and the guts dragged out onto a pile of cedar boughs. Then, piece by piece, the carving continued. The liver of the cow was then cut up into small parts and a piece given by the fiestero to every man present. The stomach and the intestines were likewise distributed.

When the blood had been cooked dry, a small girl brought out a bowlful of it and walked across the patio . She made a circuit around behind the cross and placed the bowl on the right side of the platform. She returned to the house and brought out a bowl of esquiate, which she deposited next to the blood in the same procedure. Then one fiestero walked to the patio, made the sign of the cross, took both bowls of food from the platform, and dedicated them by raising them three times in each direction. Then he took the bowls into the houses, and one by one the watchers and helpers went in to be served. The meat was guarded in the house until after the first night of the fiesta . Then it was cooked and distributed.

In Samachique pueblo on Friday, December 12, 1930, the ceremony of the Guadalupe fiesta began at 5:30 P.M. The people gathered at the church, and the matachines started to dance. They continued dancing for almost two hours. About 7:30 P.M. the maestro set off a skyrocket and rang the church bells loudly. Everyone came to the church and entered the building, with the exception of the matachines, chapeones, and musicians.

Inside the church, four women put scarfs over their heads and took lighted candles; another woman took the large picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe; another took a bowl of incense; a man took the large wooden cross.

The matachines and chapeones lined up in double formation, and the musicians began to play. The dancers did a few simple steps up to the church door. Then they turned around; and, as they moved off, the whole procession in the church followed them, headed by the maestro, the cross-bearer, and the women with the picture, incense, and candles.

A fire had been built on the wall behind the big cross in the churchyard. The dancers went up to the cross, then faced around and danced in front of it (marking time, rattling, and shouting). All the people followed. Then the dancers led the procession to the other side of the cross and shouted again. This was repeated on the four sides. Then the picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe was shown to the four directions, while everyone shouted. (Skyrockets lighted up the sky—we had furnished them.)

The procession now went to the church door, but only the dancers and the musicians went inside. After they had made a circle around the inside of the church, all the people entered and lined up on the sides. The candle-bearers placed their candles on the altar and removed their veils. The picture of the Virgin and the big cross were replaced. The maestro made a speech of some duration.

A regular church service began with prayers, chants, and songs. The two maestros and a woman singer conducted this. At the end of the service the people went outside, and the children gathered around the church door to be taught the prayer and manner of crossing themselves. The gobernador then made a sermon. A half-hour interval followed.

At 10:00 P.M. the matachines started their dance again, and continued it outside in the yard for an hour. Then they entered the church and continued dancing for two hours and a half more (fourteen numbers).

At 1:30 A.M., Saturday (December 13, 1930) the matachines, having finished dancing in the church, went to the altar and crossed themselves. Next they formed two parallel lines with the chapeones and the musicians behind them. Everyone turned around in his place, first to the left and then to the right. Next the whole line ran around in a circle and ended by facing the altar again and shouting. The circular course was repeated and ended by facing the door and shouting. Then another half-circle formed to face the altar. Each time they moved out a little way, until finally all were outside the church door. Then they ran up to the cross in the churchyard (unaccompanied by the spectators). The dancers now faced the cross, and the musicians took a position facing the dancers, on the opposite side of the cross. They shouted, turned around, and shouted again. They then ran a circular course to the right side of the cross and repeated the performance. Thus, to the four sides of the cross they paid homage, and returned to the church door again. Next they ran to their dance patio and, after two complete circles, fell into the regular matachines dance. After this long period of dancing, there was a period of rest.

At 3:30 A.M. esquiate and boiled meat were brought and placed before the chapeones . The matachines promptly started another hour of dancing. Then two chapeones took a bowl of each of the foods and walked to the center of the dance space. While everyone stood bareheaded, facing the east, they dedicated the food by raising it with outstretched arms—three times to the east, west, north, and south. The dedication consisted of tossing a bit of it three times in each direction with a dipper. Next the Indians started to serve. There were two seats made with stones. When invited to sit down, a man would come and eat there. The first man to be served raised the dipper of esquiate once in all directions, but the others merely raised the dipper above the head. Dancers, musicians, chapeones, and others were served in this order with the food brought by the fiesteros .

At 7:15 A.M., as day dawned, the dancers continued once again.

At 9:00 A.M., within the church, a service was held to inaugurate the new fiesteros and maromos appointed for the coming year. The old and the new fiesteros gathered in the church with the officials and the maestros . (The new fiesteros and maromos are appointed by the old.) The old fiesteros furnished tesgüino, which was dedicated by tossing a bit of it three times in the four directions and then served to all present. The old fiesteros placed their blankets for the new men to kneel on, and hung their rosaries on them. The retiring members knelt behind the new members. A long prayer and song service followed. The new men were given candles. The maestro then took the candles, made crosses around their heads, crossed himself, and extinguished the candles. He gave a speech and a final prayer.

At 12:00 noon the women and the men formed in the church as they had done the evening before (with the Virgin’s picture, the cross, incense, candles, and veils). Outside, the dancers and musicians also lined up as before. The eight officials walked four abreast behind the dancers. The music started, and the matachines performed a dance which consisted of those in front running forward a few steps, then turning and running to the back of the column. Then the whole procession went on as it had the night before, with the addition of a flag-bearer who waved vigorously at every pause of the procession. The dancers led the way to the church and danced inside. The prayer service was conducted. The exit from the church was led by the matachines, who danced around the cross in the yard just as they had done in the midnight ceremony.

The gobernador made a sermon, after which all assembled for a law trial.

At 2:00 P.M. the people went to the house of the fiesteros to get food. In general, the dancers were served first, then officials, musicians, chapeones, and, finally, the ordinary guests. Each and everyone (either the men or their wives) brought a container. When one was called forward to receive his bowl of stew, he poured the stew into his own container and carefully returned the bowl to the fiestero . There was some distinction made in the number of tortillas given a person. The majority received three; special people, five; and lesser folk, but two. The gobernador and officials, who marched from house to house in a body, made a ceremonial circuit around the cross on the patio, crossing themselves on each side of it and making a complete turn as they changed positions. All the houses of the three fiesteros and the two maromos were visited. At the time, no one ate.

At 5:30 P.M. the matachines again started to dance at the church. Soon afterward tesgüino was brought by the fiesteros . When the dancing ceased, two chapeones took calabashes full of tesgüino and advanced to the dance place with small dippers, which they filled and tossed in each direction and upward. The gobernador was served first. He raised his dipper in the air before drinking. Then all the others were served.

At 7:30 P.M. it was time to start for the house of the first fiestero because the tesgüino was to be served at their respective houses. The musicians started to play, and the dancers formed a double column followed by the chapeones and the officials. They inscribed a circle around the churchyard and then started up the hill to the first house. The line broke on the ascent but formed again at the top. About 50 yards from the house they stopped and the fiestero came out to meet them with a pitch-pine torch. The matachines danced, while the fiestero crossed himself. The procession now advanced to the house; and the dancers, after three circles around the cross, danced on the patio . The officials crossed themselves in their circuit around the four sides of the cross and then hung their canes and the mayor’s whip on it. The tesgüino was dedicated next. The matachines danced three numbers more and then hung their coronas, fans, and rattles on the altar. The drinking then began. No one was neglected.

Thus the party continued until dawn. When the liquor was consumed at one house, the procession moved on to the next. The numbers dwindled toward the last, since many remained at a house to continue drinking and others were not able to continue. As dawn broke, the festivities ceased. Even though the day was now Sunday, there was no service or activity.

The story of the Virgin of Guadalupe and her origin is not known to the Tarahumaras. The twelfth of December is considered one of the largest of their social occasions. There is much feasting and drinking. There are special officers and functionaries who conduct the ceremony. There are dancers and musicians to enliven the scene. It is a gay and sociable occasion.

However, the fiesta is not treated too lightly. The dancing and the ritual are seriously followed. The endurance requirements of the dancers are rigorous. The matachines are danced for two nights and a day, and the dance itself is strenuous. Obviously, it soon ceases to be a pleasure and becomes a ceremonial duty. During the long night most of the spectators disappear, but the dancers never cease their activity. The dancers do not laugh. Even the chapeones see nothing humorous in their falsetto shouting. Two of the chapeones had bull bladders blown up, and they used them to whack dogs that strayed into the churchyard. The bladders made a loud noise and the dogs ran away howling, but no one laughed. During the first night, when there were no liquid stimulants, many of the younger men dropped off to sleep and the women went back home. The active performers and the old men of the community kept the ceremony going. The fiesta is conducted exclusively by the Indians themselves. The padres seldom attend, and the Mexicans are only there to observe. The Tarahumaras have considerable interest as well as pride in the fiestas . This is shown by the large attendance and the zeal of participation in the processions.

Before the fiesta starts, the people move into the little houses in the valley. For a few days they lead a community life. The activities of making tesgüino and of grinding corn for food lend an air of excitement to things. The day before the fiesta, the cattle are sacrificed with considerable ceremony. Then for a long night the matachines are danced, and accompanied by one or two processions. A rather simple variety of activities is extended by repetition. The next day the food is distributed at the house of the fiesteros . Every man is called by name and walks before his fellows to receive food. The matachines are continued at intervals during the day. Then, finally, a long night of drinking and merrymaking sets in. It is the most elaborate affair in the Tarahumara’s life.

Ritual41,Holy Week Fiesta,"Holy Week

Before the fiesta started, arches were made of curved slender tree trunks and covered with pine branches. Twelve of these were placed around the church door, one next to the cross in the churchyard, one at each entrance to the churchyard, three on each side of the church, two behind the church. They marked the path for the processions around the church. At one side of each of these arches a small cross was placed and an artificial flower made of spreading sotoli leaves, with other green leaves as a background.

Music was furnished by drums and reed whistles (cf. Part I, p. 67). The drums were square or round, and generally about 12 inches in diameter and 3 inches thick, although some were 10 inches thick.

Spears made of bayonets or metal spear points on poles were carried. Flat, wooden, lath swords painted in orange and white were used in quantities.

The Judas’ and the Pharisees painted their legs in solid white or in stripes. They painted their faces also. They wore crowns like those of the matachines, only decorated with turkey or chicken feathers. (In other pueblos they use regular straw hats covered with turkey feathers.) Six small boys were painted from head to foot in stripes of red, white, and black. The dancer of the pascol wore clothes of cotton cloth, belts, and ankle rattles. He painted his face, head, and hands.

Four men carried four small crosses and small painted poles adorned with a grass cross. Two grass dummies represented Judas.

Thursday was the first day of the fiesta; and the arches, mentioned before, were erected in the morning. Food was placed before the saints in the church. In the afternoon, the dancers lined up in the churchyard and, to the tune of flute and drum, went running in two circles, one inside the other. Then, with the officials walking in the center, they marched to the comunidad and returned, stopping at intervals to run in circles. When they again reached the church, they lined up outside while the other people went inside to pray. After this, the children were taught the crossing prayer, and the church bells and whirl rattle were sounded.

Now a man walked three times around the churchyard, whirling the rattle. Then a guard for the saints was stationed in the church. Four men stood facing the altar. The two in front held spears. A drummer and a flute-player furnished continuous music. From time to time the head of the fiesta changed the guards. This watch was kept up until the next morning.

About nine in the evening, a procession came from the church to make a circuit around the building and through the arches. The procession consisted of:

A man with the whirl rattle.
A man with a large cross.
Two men carrying the image of a saint.
Four men with small painted crosses and painted poles.
Four maestros .
A woman with a flag.
A woman carrying the image of a saint.
A woman with incense.

Other women followed behind, and the men flanked the sides. The fariseos walked in a line on each side of the procession, carrying their swords and spears. As the procession moved forward, the drums were beat, the flutes blown, the rattles whirled, and the prayers chanted. The leaders passed by an arch, then stopped, and turned to face the four maestros who knelt directly under it. The women remained behind the maestro . While the maestros prayed in unison, the women with the incense smoked the image carried by the men and the one carried by the women. Thus they passed under all the arches in the circuit, until they again reached the church, where everyone entered and engaged in prayer service.

On Thursday this procession was followed by teaching the children to cross themselves. The gobernador gave a sermon through the long night, the four guards kept watch to the tune of a whistle and a drum. The official in charge kept prodding the sleepy ones to tell them that their time had come to join the watch.

Friday, in the early morning, the watch in the church ceased with a procession of the men, around the arches and under them. The absence of the women deprived the procession of incense, one saint, and the flag; but otherwise it was the same.

Shortly after noon more food was placed in the church for the saints, three more circuits were made by the man with the whirl rattle, and a full procession, including the women, was held.

In the late afternoon, two races were run by two sets of teams, which involved much betting and interest.

At dusk another procession was held, with the light of the ocote torches adding a festive appearance. Afterward, two sets of dancers, the Pharisees and Judas’, staged a performance in the churchyard, rivaling each other in entertaining the spectators. They danced to the tune of the flute and drum, their white painted legs, plumed crowns, and white swords shining in the moonlight. They performed by skipping, shifting, and running in dance formations interspersed with shouting and patting of the mouth. They lined up in two sets facing each other at the finish. They skipped toward each other and then backed away, shouting all the while. Some said this represented a sham battle.

Later in the evening another procession was held in which half the people went around the circuit in one direction and half in another. Still later, a regular procession was held.

Saturday morning there was a general rest, during which six small boys were painted, hair and all, with stripes of red, black, and white (see Plate XIII).

At noon the judges and the officials went to the comunidad to try numerous law cases. The small painted boys captured two birds by running them down. They almost broke up the law trial.

An hour later a pascol dancer, accompanied by the boys, marched to the church and danced to the four directions. Then, with a violin and guitar player, he entered a room of the convento, where he danced most of the afternoon.

Food and tesgüino were brought to him. Another pascolero also came and danced in the church. The pascol is a fast-stepping clog dance. The term probably comes from the Spanish pascual or pascuala, referring particularly to the fiesta at Easter time. The pascol dancers are the central figures of the fiesta . The same dancer, bearing the same name, is found among the Yaquis.

The Pharisees now started their dance again. They went to the house of each man who had made tesgüino and danced on his patio . They returned afterward to the church. After dancing for a while, they went to the comunidad and brought the officials to the church.

Two processions were formed, each led by a pascolero . They marched around the church. The Judas’ carried their two grass dummies. Finally, they entered the church, danced inside, threw ashes to the floor, and liberated the two birds which the boys had captured. The session was closed with regular prayers and sermons.

The pascoleros were the leaders, and all the people followed them. Each one led a group to one of the houses to drink tesgüino . Before leaving the church, each pascolero entered the building, danced, then circled around the yard.

At the houses the usual methods of dedicating and serving the tesgüino were followed.

Although the general plan of Holy Week is the same throughout the region, there is considerable variation in detail, especially in the more Mexicanized communities. In Guadalupe pueblo, there is much more play between the Judas’ and the Pharisees, which results in sham battles, beatings, robberies, and eventually in the burning of the dummies of Judas. A morogápitane ( more capitán ) is appointed, who takes full control of governing the fiesta week. He assumes the functions of the gobernador . There are special punishments for those who offend the customs. Thus, anyone who whistles or sings out of order is made to kneel down on small pebbles. Those who fight have to march over a long course, carrying a large pitahaya on their shoulders with a bar of iron above it. Women are punished by having to carry four decaliters of flour on their back. If they falter, they are whipped.

One is impressed by the complete foreignness of this fiesta in regard to the rest of the culture of the Tarahumaras. They speak of Pharisees and Judas’. The Judas’ use dummies which are sometimes burned in effigy. However, there is a complete lack of knowledge of the significance of these names. Even the maestro, who spoke Spanish well, knew little about them. It was a ceremony in which one knew when to parade and when to pray—that was all. The Indians-enjoy painting their faces and legs. The extensive use of color is contrary to their usual drab living. The love of noise must be a part of the attraction. The officials find an opportunity for displaying their prestige.

Ritual42,Matachine Dance,"The Matachines

The matachines are dancers who perform at the church fiestas and other ceremonies. They wear a home-made costume which is gayly colored and fancy. On the head is a corona (“crown”) composed of a circular piece of thin wood or bark with arches of bent sticks above. It is covered with tissue paper, mirrors, old cigarette packages, and other bright things. It is fastened on the head by means of a bandana handkerchief which ties under the chin and hangs down in front. Another bandana hangs down in back (cf. Plate XI). However, the Tarahumara continues to wear his headband under the corona .

A cape, which hangs from the shoulders to the knees, is worn over a regular white cotton shirt. It is made of a double piece of cloth, red on a blue or white base. Two pairs of short trousers or loose breeches are worn. The under pair is white and hangs straight down at the knees. The outer pair is red and has a deep notch cut out of each side at the knee (leaving a point in the front and back). The breeches are held in place with an ordinary Tarahumara knitted belt ( faja ). Two bandana handkerchiefs hang down from the belt in front and in back.

Colored stockings and shoes complete the dress. The stockings reach above the knees and the shoes are any kind available—up to knee boots. It is the only time in his life that a Tarahumara wears shoes.

The fan-shaped, tissue-covered frame which is carried in the left hand, and the gourd or wooden rattle, carried in the right hand, are almost a part of the costume.

The costume is highly prized by the dancers and spectators. During the evening of the fiesta, many a spectator points with pride to the dancers and whispers, “wé simáti” (“Very pretty”). The costume is particularly interesting because it is absolutely foreign to the old Tarahumara culture patterns. The Indians show no tendencies toward costuming in their own native fiestas . In the matachine attire, the only familiar pieces of clothing are the headband, shirt, and belt—minor parts of the whole effect.

The matachine costume is not the same throughout the sierra. In Guadalupe, no special clothing is used, although the dancers wear coronas and carry rattles. Only the monarco (leader) uses a fan. In sections where fancier materials are available, the costumes become more elaborate, although the patterns are the same except for the addition of red vests.

Lumholtz says that the matachines painted their faces and carried skin bags of fox, squirrel, or opossum. He does not mention the fancy dress. Today, the dancers neither paint their faces nor carry these bags.

The matachine dance is performed by an equal number of dancers (eight to twelve) and one or two monarcos or leaders. Violins and guitars furnish the music, which is a repetition of three phrases. In Samachique, as many as ten musicians play together on their homemade instruments.

The dance resembles the Virginia reel vaguely. The dancers form a double column facing the musicians. The monarco, who stands in front, indicates all movements with the fan which he carries in his left hand. All dancers beat time with their rattles while dancing. After a few phrases of the music, the leader begins the dance by marking time and shaking his rattle. At a signal from him, all the dancers whirl around in their places, first to the left, then to the right. Next, the two lines cross over and change places. The left and right whirl is repeated, while the leader spins around between the columns. Then the lines cross back to their original places. Now the leader starts a grand right and left, alternating between lines. Every dancer turns when the monarco goes around him, until, at the end of the movements, all are facing away from the musicians. At this point, the movements are repeated until the original positions are assumed again, with the leader in front and the dancers facing the orchestra. Another movement follows in which the leader takes the head position of one column and leads it in a circular course around the other column. The other column tacks on at the end, and thus a circle is inscribed, ending with the dancers in their original positions. Now the movements are repeated, until, after about ten minutes, the dance is finished. However, the finish is only a breathing spell, because the dancers hold their places and after two or three minutes repeat the whole dance. The dancing is kept up for an hour or more (sometimes as long as three hours). Then there is a real rest, during which the formation breaks up and a general hubbub of smoking and chattering commences. The chapeones stand in a line to one side of the dancers. They mark time during the dance and, at changes of movement, shout in falsetto voices.

The steps and movements of the matachine are not the same in all pueblos. One suspects that some of the variation is a result of local modification. The music, too, is not the same from one pueblo to the next. In Choro pueblo the dance is said to consist of slow music and steps. However, the matachines in general is a fast-moving, twirling, shifting dance, performed by two columns of dancers under the direction of a leader.

The men called chapeones, who stand to one side marking time and shouting in falsetto voices, are an essential part of the matachines in Samachique. These chapeones are in charge of the matachines; each man supervises one dancer. Although each matachine dancer furnishes his own costume, the chapeones oversee it so that it will conform with the others. The dancing is learned chiefly by observation, but the chapeones probably give a little instruction to newcomers. There seems to be no practicing of the dance beforehand.

There are, in all, about ten chapeones in Samachique. Of these, one is considered the head. He is in charge of all chapeones, which position, in turn, makes him head of all matachines . He must refill the vacant positions. He must keep in touch with all performers and make sure that they appear for the dance. As a symbol of his office, he has a mask carved of wood and painted with white lines. False white hair and a white beard are glued to it. He wears this mask on the back of his head during the dancing.

The head chapeón in Samachique holds a position of considerable importance. He dedicates the tesgüino at the houses of the fiesteros . He even sits in the judges’ line at law trials.

In Guadalupe pueblo there is only one chapeón, who dances with the matachines in a position at the back of the dancers which corresponds to the monarco in front. He does not shout. However, he sometimes wears a mask with painted lines and false hair. He wears it in front while dancing. There is a great deal of variation from pueblo to pueblo in regard to the matachines .

The term chapeón probably comes from the Spanish capeón, “Novillo que se capea.” Los Capeos is a fiesta in which men used to take chances with the bull, without weapons. Play-fighting is still pantomimed in some parts. (Phonetic variations on this term, as given by Dr. Parsons, 2 are: San Juan, tsabiyó; Keresan, chapió; Taos, tsabaiyúna; Hopi, tsabaiyó or cháveyo .)

The matachín, according to the Spanish dictionary, referred in ancient times to a man ridiculously garbed from head to foot with a mask and a dress of various colors. These masqueraders were accustomed to join in a dance to the lively tune of instruments. They used to make faces and deal blows with wooden swords and bladders full of air. The capeones became associated with the matachines before the pattern was introduced to the Tarahumaras. The Tarahumara variations in the pattern are of little interest here, but will prove valuable in a study of the distribution of the matachín pattern throughout Mexico. To the Tarahumaras, the matachines are not clowns, and their dress is not ridiculous but very beautiful. The head chapeón alone wears a mask, and two chapeones use the inflated bull bladders—but no wooden swords. The chapeones carry out none of the bull-fighting burlesque.

The matachines are definitely non-Tarahumara. Further study in Mexican ethnology will probably reveal a wide distribution of the matachín pattern. In two such different cultures as the Tarahumara of Chihuahua and the Tewa of New Mexico, the matachines are strikingly similar. In Dr. Parson’s description, the San Juan matachina is danced in the following manner: It is performed at Christmas time. There are ten dancers—five on a side—and a monanka (Tara. monarco ) in the middle. The dancers carry a matachina stick in the left hand (like the “fan” of the Tarahumaras) and a rattle in the right. The costume consists of a colorful headgear, a scarf hooked under the chin, handkerchiefs hanging from the waist, and other details which, though they differ somewhat from the Tarahumara, give a similar mass effect. The abuelos, who are also called tsapiyó (Tara, chapeón; or, in phonetics, tcapeyón ), shout in falsetto voices. Masks are sometimes worn by these abuelos .

The Indians dance the matachines at San.Juan pueblo, and even the Mexicans dance it at Alcalde, three miles away. According to Dr. Parsons, the matachines are also danced by the pueblos of Taos, Jemez, and Keresan pueblos. The Yaquis have the same dance and also clowns. In Dinamita, Durango, the matachines also play at being clowns. Thirty years ago, Lumholtz mentioned briefly that the matachines were dancers to violin music. Their present object, he said, is to make the people laugh, but without doubt they are the remnant of some ancient custom.

The study of distributions is not necessary to depict the matachines as a foreign element in the culture of the Tarahumaras. They stand out in marked contrast to the primitive patterns. The costume is made up of trade cloth, bandana handkerchiefs, and numerous pieces of paper, glass, mirrors, and other things of non-Indian manufacture. A Tarahumara never wears shoes (though he wears sandals) except as a part of his matachine costume. The music is played on the violin and guitar—instruments that have been introduced into Tarahumara patterns. The tunes are Mexican in type. The dance steps are performed by the men and are fast and vigorous. The names for the dance, the performers, and the costume are all Spanish, or at least of non-Tarahumara extraction.

The matachines are not clowns. The dancers perform dutifully and seriously for long hours at a time. Although the dance is foreign, it has been accepted thoroughly by the Indians. It is not possible to state the exact number of years that the matachines have been developing in Samachique, but the interval cannot be great. Today, many Indians are able to dance the matachines . The dancers receive deference in the pre-Holy Week church fiestas . The head chapeón is a man of distinction even in non-festal matters. The Indians take considerable pride in their costumes and their ability to dance.

Furthermore, the matachines are no longer limited to church fiestas . One of the first intrusions was in the death fiesta . In observing a death fiesta it is customary to imitate some of the things the deceased did in life. Thus, if a man has been a racer, a ceremonial race is run. Logically, it follows that if a man has been a matachín, a performance of the dance takes place. Since the more noise, excitement, and activity there is only adds to the pleasure of the dead, there is no objection to the introduction of the matachines . From the death fiesta, it is only a step to the large curing fiestas . The idea of the curing fiesta, in many cases, is for a large display; and thus the matachines fit in nicely. Interesting enough is the fact that the matachines have not supplanted the dutubúri, or even forced it into a minor position. The chanter of the dutubúri still commands the main patio and the position in front of the three crosses. There is a special cross erected for the matachines to one side of the main patio . However, the matachines have not been incorporated as an integral part of any fiesta outside the church group. Many fiestas can, and are, given without this dance. But it has, nevertheless, made considerable advances in the basic Tarahumara patterns, and its position is constantly strengthening. Furthermore, the matachines have extended even to the non-Christian Tarahumaras.

Ritual43,Native Fiestas,"Native Fiestas

The native fiestas are those which involve the Tarahumara’s daily home life, as contrasted to the church fiestas, which are performed at the church on the Catholic holy days. The distinction between the two is sharp, and few traits are found which are common to both groups of fiestas . The church fiestas are chiefly interesting in demonstrating how a complex ceremony involving many foreign elements, costumes, dances, prayers, and processions can become an accepted and an important part of a culture. In the native fiestas there are no foreign traits, for, basically, they are old and whatever changes that have taken place have been substitutions of materials rather than changes in pattern.

Most of the native fiestas include the idea of a ceremonial “curing.” Thus, they are performed for the curing of animals, fields, and people; for the prevention and cure of sickness; for the bringing of rain and for the dispersion of plagues; at ceremonies of birth and of death; for the curing of the church; and finally, for the curing of the first corn, beans, and other vegetables. Despite such variation in function, the fiestas show a remarkable consistency in execution. Thus, all involve the killing of some animal and the dancing of the dutubúri on a specially prepared patio to the chanting of a shaman. All are occasions of feasting, and meat is seldom eaten at other times.

In the sections which follow, the consistent elements found in all fiestas are first described, and then the differences involved in specific cures and fiestas are distinguished.

Component Parts

Almost every Tarahumara house has a dance patio near it. This consists of a cleared plot of ground which is either round or square, and from 15 to 30 feet in diameter (or on a side). On the east side, a low platform and two or three crosses mark the altar site. The patio is neglected except when it is about to be used.

The patios are cleared of all grass and made level. In some situations this necessitates a slight building-up on one side. The platforms consist of one or two planks set on a frame of four forked sticks and two crossbars. They are about 5 feet long, 2 feet broad, and 2.5 feet high, though the dimensions are not fixed. Behind this table, crosses are erected which are about 3 or 4 feet in height. The central one, when there are three, is the highest. Generally, the crosses are placed directly in the ground. On some patios, however, they are placed in a special holder which consists of a beam with three slots cut in it. The crosses are made of sticks cut from pine logs; and they form a Roman cross.

The platform altar is probably a recent addition to the patio . Lumholtz does not mention any such platform but says that the crosses were 1 foot high on the average and that some were raised 2 feet above the floor. Some patios, also, are still to be found without platforms. At these the food offered to the crosses is placed directly on the ground before them.

The significance of the patio and its parts, like all the Tarahumara religious notions, is confused with Catholicism. The informant, Jesús, explained his notions as follows. The circular patio represents the world. 2 The four directions are the gates of the world, and everything used on the patio must be dedicated to them. The three crosses and the tables are always on the east side, where the sun rises. To the east, behind the crosses, is the gate where the house is located in which Christ was born. To the opposite direction lie the home of three animals: (a) the fox (kiyótci), whose cry means death to a woman; (b) the owl (dutúgari), whose cry means death to a male; (c) the okó, a bird whose cry means death to a child. These three hoot and howl to advise the people that someone will become sick and probably die. Thus food and drink are always offered to them in the dedication. To the north is the gate of the gobernador and the officials, and to the south is the seat of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The home of God is above. In these days the crosses are usually identified with the Trinity, and consequently three of them are used. Lumholtz identifies the crosses as Father Sun and Mother Moon, and, when there is a third, as Morning Star.

The patio is called awílatci (from awí, “to dance,” plus latci, place suffix), or “dance place.” The names for the four directions of the dedication on the patio are given in a song as follows:

baisá namó depá: three planes above
baisá oruí: three to east
baisá tobóku: three to west
baisá omígiógona: three to north
baisá túgeke: three to south

No names were given for the crosses, except the center one, which represents Tata Dios . Dedication is performed to the center one first, then to the right-hand one, then to the left-hand one (all the while facing the crosses). In fact, the Tarahumara word for the cross is kúrasi, and for the platform, tábara; these words obviously are derived in each case from the Spanish cruz and tabla .

The other things used on the patio will be described as their use is mentioned. In general, the description above covers the equipment of an average patio .

Feasting is an essential part of every native fiesta . For any “cure” that involves the dancing of the dutubúri, an animal is sacrificed and food is prepared. Goats are killed for an ordinary fiesta and cattle for a large function. The method and ceremony involved in the killing of an animal have been described in the section on church fiestas (see p. 304). The performance is practically the same at native fiestas . The animal is thrown on the patio and bled. The blood is dedicated to the four directions and then cooked immediately. The animal is skinned, and the whole carcass is hung up on a pole placed in the ground at the north end of the platform. The head is set on the ground in front of the pole, and the feet are placed on the table. After the meat has hung for awhile, some of it is taken to be cooked.

Animals are seldom killed except at fiestas . In other words, the killing of an animal is almost always accompanied by the dancing of the dutubúri . There are rare occasions when this is not so, notably birth ceremonies (see p. 234) and on the repayment of a loan of cattle (see p. 197). The animals most commonly killed are goats and cattle, although sheep, deer, squirrels, and chickens, not to mention burros, mules, and horses, are also sacrificed.

Food is served three times at a regular fiesta: at dusk, midnight, and dawn; or at midnight, dawn, and noon of the next day. The first food served is always the cooked blood of the killed animal and esquiate . The other foods are not fixed.

The food is always dedicated before it is served. Small portions of it are placed on the table in front of the crosses. An Indian takes the bowls of food, raises them in his outstretched arms, gesturing three times toward the crosses and then three times toward each of the four directions. Then he replaces them on the table. Another Indian salutes the four cardinal points with incense. The chanter faces the altar with the men standing at his left and the women at his right. In this position he chants a special song for almost half an hour. The food is again smoked and again raised three times in each direction. After a part of the food has been dedicated in this manner, other ollas are brought in to be served without further ceremony. The food is served from the patio —the men from one bowl, the women from another. Generally, the chanter is served first.

Almost as essential as food is the ever present tesgüino . Although some native fiestas are given without liquor (such as the fiesta celebrated three days after a death; see p. 239), it is only because insufficient time has elapsed in which to make the beer. However, it is generally prepared the first moment possible, and the fiesta ends in intoxication. It is interesting to note that the drinking does not start until morning, although the dancing and chanting have been in session all during the night.

Ollas of tesgüino are placed behind the crosses. Before the tesgüino -drinking, the chanter dedicates the liquor. (Any ollas of tesgüino kept in the house are dedicated by the doctor, either after the chanter has dedicated his or simultaneously.) The dedicator stands in the center of the patio with a calabash of the corn beer held in his left hand and a small dipper in his right. He dips out a small amount and tosses it toward the crosses. This he does three times, then turns and throws three dippers to the west, three to the north, and three to the south—and, finally, one upward to the sky.

The man who plays the most necessary part at any native fiesta is the chanter of the dutubúri and the yúmari . He is called sawéame, which means “he who has the rattle” ( saeála, “rattle”).

At intervals during the fiesta, the sawéame stands on the patio shaking his rattle and chanting songs which are without intelligible words. He wears his blanket so wrapped as to leave his right arm free. In Guadalupe pueblo he wears a bandana handkerchief on his head. He beats out the rhythm with his rattle, by a movement from the elbow and the wrist. His knees move slightly in time. His voice hums the refrain over and over again. He contributes the basis of the butubúri, which is described below. The work of the sawéame is very exacting, both in creating rhythm and in the enactment of the ceremony.

The sawéame is an important man, but he is quite distinct from the other shamans. The curers do not chant, and the chanters do not cure. At most fiestas, both chanter and shaman are present, each with special functions. Even in the performances of a single ceremony, the doctor and chanter do not conflict.

Only a few men know how to chant. They are said to have learned by observation. All the chants are rather short. Minor refrains are repeated over and over. In an ordinary fiesta, at least two different chants are used—one for dancing and one for the dedication of food. Theoretically, each man creates his own chant. However, the tunes of one chanter are very little different from those of another. Certainly, a definite pattern is followed. Furthermore, two or three chanters may work together at a large fiesta, chanting the same tune as they walk side by side on the patio . This indicates that the tunes are not very original inventions.

It is a common claim that the chants possess words, but that only jargon is sung, since the real words are the secret kept by the chanter. It is true that intelligible words are not sung. Monosyllables and humming comprise most of the chants. Two of my informants were semi-shamans, but they did not know the words. Lumholtz, however, obtained words in some cases. It is possible that jargon has replaced the use of words in the last thirty years.

At the beginning and at the end of a fiesta, a short ceremony accompanies the presentation of the rattle to the chanter by the master of the house. While the chanter stands at the edge of the patio, the master takes the rattle and shakes it before the crosses and to each of the cardinal points. He then walks up to where the sawéame is standing and makes a short speech, in which he asks him to sing well in order to achieve the purpose of the fiesta . The two men cross themselves several times and exchange the rattle. Now the sawéame makes the circuit of the patio, rattling to the crosses and to the four directions. At the close of the fiesta, he repeats this procedure and makes a speech to the master of the house. The master then rattles to the four directons.

For his work at a fiesta, the chanter receives a quarter of the meat and a bowl of food (as the shaman does also). The tesgüino placed at the altar is his to dedicate and serve. When food is served to the people, he is given his share first. Apart from fiestas, he is just an ordinary Tarahumara. One does not see the same fear and respect paid to the chanters as is paid to a powerful shaman.

The chanter stands at the outer edge of the patio, facing the crosses. In this position he beats his rattle and hums several refrains of his chant. Then he chants one refrain with a steady shaking of his rattle, rather than with the beat. This is the announcement for a change in position. He immediately walks a few steps forward toward the crosses, stops, turns, and faces the other way, and repeats the chanting. This he continues for hours, shifting his position back and forth across the patio at intervals.

The men do not dance, but line up on the left side of the chanter as he faces the cross (i.e., the north side of the patio ) and march back and forth with him. They keep themselves wrapped in their blankets and sometimes cross their arms over their chests. Sometimes women walk on the other side of the chanter in a similar fashion.

The women do the dancing. They line up in a file. With the right hand, each dancer holds the left hand of the dancer in front. They are lined up on the right side (south side) of the chanter; and when he shifts his position, they are left facing him, which is the signal to start the dance. The step consists of putting the left foot forward for a short step. The right foot is brought up to it, and the weight is shifted from the left to the right foot with a slight hop and a stamp. The left foot is then free to repeat the action. Performing this step in unison, the women move horizontally across the patio and then return. This shift is repeated six or seven times; but on the last time, instead of returning, they continue in an arc around the patio until they reach a position on the south side of the chanter. Here they stand motionless until the chanter again shifts his position, at which point they repeat the dance.

This is the dance of the dutubúri . When the statement is made that the dutubúri is danced all night, it means that the chanting and dancing is performed during four or five periods of one-half to three-quarters of an hour each, with long rest periods in between. The amount of chanting and dancing varies with sawéames and the spirit of the people on the occasion. The chanting is the essential part and goes on whether the dancers perform or not.

The chanting and dancing are always performed on the main patio in front of the crosses (though the women may dance around the outside edge of a large patio ). No matter what other features are introduced— matachines, pascol, death dance, or peyote dance—the dutubúri keeps its position. Furthermore, no other music than the chanting and rattling are used, and these are continued even though the violins and guitars of the matachines almost drown out their sound. The Tarahumaras themselves declare that the dutubúri and the chanting are directed to the crosses.

It is a solemn dance and certainly religious in its import. The drinking of tesgüino is usually started after the dutubúri has ended, though some overlapping of these two events may occur. On the whole, the chanter hums, the men march, and the women dance as a duty. Ever man wants to march back and forth with the chanter for awhile. Even tiny children are made to march or dance between older relatives. This is partly for their instruction, but more with an idea of completing family participation.

Many of the Tarahumaras-at the present time use the terms dutubúri and yúmari interchangeably. However, a ceremonial dance was performed at the end of most fiestas which was so definite that I described it with the phrase: “the crossing of the patio.” This ceremony was identified as yúmari (distinctly separate from dutubúri ) by an old peyote doctor, and his description corresponds to the description given by Lumholtz.

This ceremony is performed at the close of the fiesta, and many of the performers appear to be slightly intoxicated, though no one seems to care.

The chanter takes his position facing the crosses, with the men lined up on his left and the women on his right. The master of the house then takes the meat from its position on the pole by the altar and gives a part of it to each man to carry. In the meantime the sawéame chants. (This carrying of the meat is not always a part of the ceremony.) The men march beside the chanter as he leads the dance, and the women dance their hopping step.

The chanter, together with the people, moves from his position (Fig. 4) to the center of the patio, and then moves backward to his position again. This shift is made three times. Next he moves three times from the center to the crosses and back to the center, returning the last time to the original position. The chanter moves through an arc to position ( c ) and then straight across the patio to ( b ). The men march beside him, but the women make a big circle almost completely around the patio in order to reach their place on his right, as he faces the center from position ( b ). Three shifts are made from ( b ) to the center ( a ) and back. The chanter now leads across to position ( c ) and the women again have to circle to keep in position.

Three shifts are then made from ( c ) to the center ( a ). The chanter then walks from ( c ) via the center, to his original position ( s ), where three more shifts are made to center ( a ) and back. Next the chanter makes three circles of the patio to the right, with the men walking behind him and the women dancing on the outside. At the end, all line up at at the beginning and the master of the house places the meat on the pole. Thus ends the ceremony.

It is interesting to note the comparison between this strictly native ceremony and the dance by the matachines and people around the cross in the churchyard at the fiesta of Guadalupe (see p. 307). Perhaps the yúmari has been adapted to the church ceremony.

At the edge, or just outside, of the patio at any fiesta at which dutubúri is danced, a small cross is placed to ward off sickness. This is referred to as nawilíki (“sickness”). Every time food is placed on the altar, a small bowlful is placed beside this cross with the words: “Nawilíki go’ámela ba; kusiméra go’ ósaga” (“Sickness is going to eat; after eating it will go again”).

When the food at the altar has been eaten and cleared away, the food at the little cross is buried in a hole in the ground, bowl and all. These words are said: “Waminá tósi yéko bá tási galá kámpa” (“This food does not serve; let us bury it”).

Thus sickness is avoided. It is considered dangerous to omit this ceremony, and in some fiestas two crosses are used, one on each side of the patio .",0,1,1,1,1,1
Ritual44,Curing Fiestas,"Curing Fiestas

In order to illustrate some of the things mentioned before in this chapter, the following fiesta is described in some detail. Although the natives said that this was to be a fiesta for curing sick animals, it turned out to be one for curing a sick old woman instead. As in many of these smaller fiestas, in which the main purpose is to eat meat and to drink, any excuse is given for its performance. There were only ten men and six or seven women present at this fiesta . It was held in February in Guadalupe pueblo.

I arrived about nine in the evening and found the dancing of the dutubúri already in progress. A full moon showed the patio clearly. There was a table, behind which were three crosses hung with crucifixes. Food, together with a cow’s four hoofs, a bowl of incense, and the chanter’s rattle, were on the table. To the north of the platform was a high branching pole with the butchered meat of a cow hanging on it. The head was at the foot of the pole, horns down. To the south of the platform was a slender rod with a piece of liver and tripe hanging from it (cf. food for dead, p.248). At the back edge of the patio, behind the crosses, was a tiny cross with a small bowl of food before it—the nawilíki (see p. 275).

At midnight, the food in front of the nawilíki cross was changed and the bowls on the tables dedicated. One woman took a bowl of olíki and another, one of blood and tripe stew. Facing the altar, they raised them slowly three times in the air. Then, walking four steps away from the altar, they again raised the bowls three times. This ceremony was repeated, first toward the left and then the right sides of the patio .

Next a woman took a bowl of coals and incense and knelt before the table, making crosses with smoke. Then she made crosses of smoke to the four directions. The sawéame now took his rattle and stood facing the altar at the opposite edge of the patio . For half an hour he chanted the song to dedicate the food. A guitar-player strummed at the same time. The men lined up on the left side of the chanter; and the women on his right. They did nothing but stand facing the table. At the end of this procedure, the four directions were again smoked with incense, and the bowls of food raised as before. Now new ollas of food were brought to the patio and added to the dedicated parts without further ceremony. Everyone present was served in small bowls—the men from one olla, the women from another. The chanter received his food first. All ate and returned their bowls with the “Thank you” phrase, “Matétera ba.”

The chanter again took his position facing the table, with the men to his left, the women to his right. He made a speech to this effect: “Here we have our patio with the three crosses hung with crucifixes. We are singing and dancing before these crosses, asking God to drive away sickness and to pardon us. Beware Tarahumaras that you do not become lazy and fail in your dancing.” After these words, he made the sign of the cross toward the altar and toward each of the four directions. First the men and then the women made the same ceremonial circuit. At the finish they said again, “Matétera ba .

The chanter began to rattle and hum the refrain of the dutubúri . The men lined up beside him, and the women started their hopping, stamping step (cf. p. 273). This continued until the host came out of the house and planted a large white flag in the ground before the central cross.

An interim of smoking followed during which much of the meat was taken from the pole and cut up to be cooked by the women. The men sat around the fire during the intervals, smoking and joking, while the tireless women continued grinding, pounding, and cooking. At 2:00 A.M. another period of half an hour of chanting took place, and at 3:30 A.M. it was repeated for forty-five minutes. The chanter worked alone much of the time, although some of the men usually walked beside him and some of the women danced for short periods.

At dawn, new food was placed on the table and before the nawilíki cross. It was dedicated in the same manner as the midnight food: raised to the directions, smoked with incense, and chanted to by the sawéame . At the close of the dedication, food was again served. (Food consisted of tortillas and meat balls. The tortillas were laid out in piles on the altar.)

About 9:00 A.M. the shaman (my informant later) arrived. He went directly to the altar, crossed himself before the crosses, and faced the four directions. Then he saluted everyone present.

Tesgüino of mescal was brought, and placed under the table. One cross was taken and placed beside the tesgüino in the house. The shaman and the chanter dedicated the tesgüino (from the house and from the patio ) simultaneously by tossing three dipperfuls in each direction and one upward. The drinking began with the usual exchange of drinks.

At noon, more food (milk and posóli ) was placed on the table and dedicated as before. The sawéame chanted, and three small girls (about three, five, and seven) danced the dutubúri led by the eldest. Their fond grandmother watched them as she walked beside the chanter.

In the afternoon, the shaman cured the sick woman. The ceremony ended with the dancing of the yúmari (cf. p. 274).

The “curing” of fields and animals is the most important and the most complex of the native fiestas . The animals and the fields should be cured every year to avoid sickness, and especially to ward off the dreaded lightning. In Quírare, the people had become negligent in the curing of their animals, and a thunderbolt hit a corral full of animals, killing a large number of them. Thus, the next year everyone observed the ceremony. The following is a description of this fiesta as witnessed by Zingg in Quírare in April, supplemented by information from the shaman Jesús.

In the late afternoon a cow was killed and the meat hung on a pole on the patio . The three crosses behind the table were draped with manta and hung with rosaries. The cures to be used were arranged in small bowls on the manta-covered table, while a pile of cedar branches and a bowl of tesgüino were placed below the table. (The list of cures will be given at the end of this description.) Starting at dusk, two sawéames chanted the dutubúri and the women danced at intervals during the entire night. In the morning, food and tesgüino were served to everyone present.

A blanket was folded on the ground behind the table, and a widow and her three children (who were giving the fiesta ) knelt on it. The shaman cured them by moistening their heads with a pine branch dipped in a mixture of sotoli ( seléke ) and mescal ( méke watusá ), and a mixture of ashes in water (the same cure used in the burial ceremony) (cf. p. 238). Having cured each member of the family in this fashion (by making the sign of the cross and turning around once behind each one), the doctor made a ceremonial circuit of the patio, sprinkling the altar, and the people gathered around him. The cured family crossed themselves near the altar and toward the cardinal points. More tesgüino was then served.

The men who were going to cure the fields and animals now lined up in the patio . The doctor marked crosses around the head and shoulders of each one from the front and back sides. After taking a drink of tesgüino, each man was given a bowl containing one of the cures and a pine branch for sprinkling it on. The doctor took a cross and led the procession in three ceremonial circuits of the patio, every man turning in a circle at each of the cardinal points. A violin and guitar furnished the music. The procession marched around the house, and then out to the fields and fruit trees, sprinkling the mixtures everywhere.

While this was going on, the two sawéames continued chanting on the patio and several women danced the dutubúri .

After the circuits of the fields had been made, the animals were driven together. The curers made three circles around them, sprinkling their mixtures. At each of the cardinal points, the sprinklers turned around and the shaman made a cross with his knife. Then all returned to the altar and made a ceremonial circuit.

A fire was built among the cattle and an animal seized. A hot iron from another fire was used by the doctor to mark crosses on the animal’s head, shoulders, and hindquarters. He burned off a bit of hair which he threw to the winds. The animal was then sprinkled with the mixtures. It was not hurt by the treatment. After all the cattle and burros had been treated in this manner, cedar boughs were thrown on the fire, and the dense smoke which resulted was fanned toward the animals. (The burros were led individually through the smoke.)

The family giving the fiesta again knelt on a blanket on the patio to be cured. The shaman lighted a corncob and made a circuit around the crosses, turning around before each change of position and making movements in the air with the burning cob. He cured the kneeling people with the burning cob by singeing a bit of hair on the top of their heads, and by making crosses around each one. He hung three of his bead rosaries on the kneelers and then continued marking an impressive series of circles and crosses with the burning cob. After he had taken back his rosaries, the cured ones again crossed themselves around the altar.

The shaman took the blanket from the ground and raised it to the four directions. Then he took the cotton cloth from the crosses (leaving only the rosaries) and dedicated it to the four directions. All observers shouted: “Matétera ba.”

A fire was now built on the dancing patio, and cedar boughs were brought to place on it, creating a thick heavy smoke again. Four women and three men held hands in a circle around the fire and danced in the choking smoke while the chanters hummed. Having circled the fire, they varied their performance several times by approaching close to it and retreating. Then the women kicked the fire to pieces and removed it from the patio . The dutubúri continued again. At the close of the curing, the women who had been dancing the dutubúri made a ceremonial circuit of the patio, crossing themselves. The men who had sprinkled the cures did likewise. All finished by saying, “Matétera ba.” The older sawéame then returned the rattle to the host, as described on page 272. The ceremony was now over, and the customary drinking and merrymaking began.

Though the time is not absolutely fixed, this curing is usually performed when the fields have been planted and the corn is about 2 inches high. Some people cure their fields several times. In Guadalupe pueblo, they cure them three times before planting, when the corn is about 6 inches high and again when the corn is higher. Animals and fields may be cured separately, although the two are commonly combined, as in the above-described fiesta .

Five to ten families may join in giving a fiesta for curing the fields, each one furnishing food and drink. In such fiestas, the fields belonging to each family are visited.

Ten or twelve cures are prepared for this fiesta, although all of them need not be employed every time. Some of the cures commonly used by the Tarahumaras of Samachique, Quírare, and Guadalupe are listed here:

1. Tesgüino ( suwíki ) is always used as a cure. A gourdful is placed on the altar, quite apart from the bowlful below the table. The curative properties of tesgüino are emphasized continually.

2. Esquiate ( keolíki ) is the food prepared by grinding toasted corn with water. Food and drink are presented as part of the cure.

3. Mescal ( lechuguilla, Sp.; méke watusá, Tara.) is cooked in the ground ovens and then pounded up with water. It is a common cure used for people, fields, and animals.

4. Sotoli ( seléke ) is a fibrous plant used in basketry, but also contains common curative properties. It, too, is pounded and mixed with water. The mixture of the mescal and sotoli in one bowl is common.

5. Chuchupate ( wasía ) is a common medicinal plant used to cure people. It is pounded and mixed with water for this ceremony.

6. A salty stone mordant ( goyáka ) used in all dyes figures in the curing of the animals. It is ground, and used either dry or mixed with water.

7. Chiltipiquín ( kolí ) is ground and mixed with water for a cure. In certain superstitions it is supposed to keep away the evil disigí (cf. p. 265), and it is also used to prevent sickness after burials (cf. p. 238). It is a common cure for people as well as fields and animals.

8. The ashes of lime ( napisóko ) are used either dry or mixed with water. The doctors find many uses for ashes in the cures after burial (cf. p. 238) and also in other cures.

9. Fresno ( uléke ) is also used. The bark of this ash tree is pounded up with water. It is a wood much used by the Tarahumaras in their daily life, especially for making artifacts.

10. Cedar ( wa’áka or awolí ) boughs of either variety are used to create smoke. They are placed on an open flame. This smoke is used in curing of all kinds.

11. Salt ( gonáka ) is mixed with water for the cure.

12. A dish of red earth ( sitáka ) is also used in many cases.

13. Ocotillo ( wasálawa ) shavings are used. These shavings have many medicinal properties. Among other things, they are employed as a cure for fright (cf. p. 263).

14. A medicinal plant called ónowa is pounded and mixed with water.

15. Ground raw corn ( suunúku ) and ground beans ( muníki ) are used in some curings.

16. Ocote (pitch-pine) ( tcopéke ) is frequently used in the ceremony, though not carried as a cure.

17. The ever present incense ( molewáka ) figures in the curing. In Guadalupe it is carried in the procession and the animals are smoked.

This list of ceremonial plants and cures is interesting because all of them have other uses in the life of the Tarahumara. Many are considered valuable remedies for diseases, and others are common essentials, such as the mordant stone for the dye and the ash-tree bark.

When the insects eat the roots of the corn plants, a special cure is used. Handfuls of worms are brought and placed in a bowl of water on the table, and ocotillo ( wasálawa, cure 13) is mixed with it. Food is placed on the table near it. In the procession for curing the fields, this bowl is also taken—last in the line. At the end of the ceremony, the bowlful of worms is buried in the ground.",0,1,0,1,1,1
Ritual45,Rain Fiesta,"Rain Fiesta

Since the Tarahumaras are chiefly an agricultural people, most of the native fiestas pertain to the crops and their outcome. The treatment of the fields does not omit the “curing” ceremony; but, as Zingg describes it, neither does it omit the fertilization of the fields with manure. However, the fiesta to secure the blessed and necessary rain does not have the practical supplement of irrigation, and so becomes even more important in that it is the only remedy.

Some Indians say that ghosts advise them when to give the rain fiesta . The animals, too, tell the Tarahumaras what to do in the droughts. Lorenzo told us that one of his friends went by a cattle pen during the drought of last summer and heard one of the bulls say that rain was needed and a dance ought to be given. The animal’s advice was heeded and rain followed. The talking bull said, before it was killed, that the fiesta should be a small one—a single violin, two guitars, three matachines, and one sawéame . Each of ten families furnished a cow. The little chickens sang, and the dogs barked. The bull said to put lots of fish at the cross to call the water. It also instructed the Tarahumaras to kill a sheep, squirrel, deer, and two or three goats under three years of age.

It is common for many families to join together for the rain fiesta, and it is considered more effective if several fiestas are given in different places on the same night. It is a regular fiesta with three crosses, the nawilíki, and the slaughter of a bull. Tesgüino is made from mescal ( tcawíki ); corn is not used—at least not in Guadalupe pueblo. Food is served three times. The sawéame chants, and the women dance the dutubúri all night.

In the morning the yúmari is danced with the following variations from the description on page 274. The doctor walks beside the chanter, and at the first and last of the ceremony he crosses the directions with incense smoke. Three pieces of ocote are placed on the altar, and a knife is stuck in the ground next to the center cross.

After the yúmari, the people line up again beside the chanter—the men to the left, the women to the right. The doctor takes the three pitch-pine sticks, lights them, and makes crosses to the four directions. He walks up to the line of people and makes a cross in front of them. He draws a long line of flame in front of the people, and repeats this three times, making a half-turn at the end of the line before returning. Then he draws three lines of flame along the back side. He returns the pitch-pine to the altar and repeats the whole performance by cutting lines with the knife.

At this point in the ceremony, the sawéame gives a sermon:
""Here we are humbly asking God to send us rain. Here we have made a patio and placed three crosses thereon. The crosses face three times above [to east] and three times below [to west] with arms outstretched [to north and south]; and with head turned heavenward. We have killed a cow which used to eat grass here with such contentment. We have made tesgüino and dedicated it to the gods who taught us to make it so long ago. We have worked hard dancing all night long. We are not afraid, for in three days there will come the rain. We humbly stand before God asking pardon.""

At the end of the sermon everyone goes to the altar to cross himself, the men making the circuit around it to the right, the women following afterward, but going to the left. The sawéame now shakes his rattle to the four directions and returns it to the host, who repeats the shaking circuit after receiving it. Only the drinking remains to complete the fiesta .",0,0,0,0,1,1
Ritual46,Birth Curing Fiesta,"Three days after the birth of a child (or four days if the child is a female) the “curing” fiesta is given. A goat is killed and tesgüino is made, but the dutubúri is not necessarily danced. Ordinarily the patio is not used, but a cross is placed in the house beside the jar of tesgüino . The shaman dedicates the tesgüino and serves part of it. Then the family kneels down before the doctor, who takes incense ( molewáka ) and marks crosses in the air on the four sides of each individual. Next he takes three lighted sticks of pitch-pine (four for a female child) and makes more crosses in the air. Then he burns a bit of the hair off the top of the head of each member of the family kneeling before him. With water in his mouth, he blows a cross on the head of each person. The curing is finished and the tesgüino -drinking continues.

The curing fiesta described by Lumholtz 2 is slightly different. He mentions a fire built of corncobs and the child, placed on a blanket, put three times in the smoke of the fire. The doctor then makes three parallel lines and three other cross-lines with the charred end of a corncob on the child’s head. He sprinkles the baby’s head with tesgüino . Sometimes he anoints the baby with a mixture of rattlesnake fat and herbs, or else puts it in the sun for awhile.

Three of these curing fiestas are given for a male child and four for a female. They may be held in connection with a working tesgüinada or may be a small fiesta for this special purpose. There is no fixed time for them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual47,Yumari,"Many of the Tarahumaras-at the present time use the terms dutubúri and yúmari interchangeably. However, a ceremonial dance was performed at the end of most fiestas which was so definite that I described it with the phrase: “the crossing of the patio.” This ceremony was identified as yúmari (distinctly separate from dutubúri ) by an old peyote doctor, and his description corresponds to the description given by Lumholtz.

This ceremony is performed at the close of the fiesta, and many of the performers appear to be slightly intoxicated, though no one seems to care.

The chanter takes his position facing the crosses, with the men lined up on his left and the women on his right. The master of the house then takes the meat from its position on the pole by the altar and gives a part of it to each man to carry. In the meantime the sawéame chants. (This carrying of the meat is not always a part of the ceremony.) The men march beside the chanter as he leads the dance, and the women dance their hopping step.

The chanter, together with the people, moves from his position (Fig. 4) to the center of the patio, and then moves backward to his position again. This shift is made three times. Next he moves three times from the center to the crosses and back to the center, returning the last time to the original position. The chanter moves through an arc to position ( c ) and then straight across the patio to ( b ). The men march beside him, but the women make a big circle almost completely around the patio in order to reach their place on his right, as he faces the center from position ( b ). Three shifts are made from ( b ) to the center ( a ) and back. The chanter now leads across to position ( c ) and the women again have to circle to keep in position.

Three shifts are then made from ( c ) to the center ( a ). The chanter then walks from ( c ) via the center, to his original position ( s ), where three more shifts are made to center ( a ) and back. Next the chanter makes three circles of the patio to the right, with the men walking behind him and the women dancing on the outside. At the end, all line up at at the beginning and the master of the house places the meat on the pole. Thus ends the ceremony.

It is interesting to note the comparison between this strictly native ceremony and the dance by the matachines and people around the cross in the churchyard at the fiesta of Guadalupe (see p. 307). Perhaps the yúmari has been adapted to the church ceremony.

At the edge, or just outside, of the patio at any fiesta at which dutubúri is danced, a small cross is placed to ward off sickness. This is referred to as nawilíki (“sickness”). Every time food is placed on the altar, a small bowlful is placed beside this cross with the words: “Nawilíki go’ámela ba; kusiméra go’ ósaga” (“Sickness is going to eat; after eating it will go again”).

When the food at the altar has been eaten and cleared away, the food at the little cross is buried in a hole in the ground, bowl and all. These words are said: “Waminá tósi yéko bá tási galá kámpa” (“This food does not serve; let us bury it”).

Thus sickness is avoided. It is considered dangerous to omit this ceremony, and in some fiestas two crosses are used, one on each side of the patio .",0,0,0,1,1,0
Ritual48,Dutuburi Dance,"The men do not dance, but line up on the left side of the chanter as he faces the cross (i.e., the north side of the patio ) and march back and forth with him. They keep themselves wrapped in their blankets and sometimes cross their arms over their chests. Sometimes women walk on the other side of the chanter in a similar fashion.

The women do the dancing. They line up in a file. With the right hand, each dancer holds the left hand of the dancer in front. They are lined up on the right side (south side) of the chanter; and when he shifts his position, they are left facing him, which is the signal to start the dance. The step consists of putting the left foot forward for a short step. The right foot is brought up to it, and the weight is shifted from the left to the right foot with a slight hop and a stamp. The left foot is then free to repeat the action. Performing this step in unison, the women move horizontally across the patio and then return. This shift is repeated six or seven times; but on the last time, instead of returning, they continue in an arc around the patio until they reach a position on the south side of the chanter. Here they stand motionless until the chanter again shifts his position, at which point they repeat the dance.

This is the dance of the dutubúri . When the statement is made that the dutubúri is danced all night, it means that the chanting and dancing is performed during four or five periods of one-half to three-quarters of an hour each, with long rest periods in between. The amount of chanting and dancing varies with sawéames and the spirit of the people on the occasion. The chanting is the essential part and goes on whether the dancers perform or not.

The chanting and dancing are always performed on the main patio in front of the crosses (though the women may dance around the outside edge of a large patio ). No matter what other features are introduced— matachines, pascol, death dance, or peyote dance—the dutubúri keeps its position. Furthermore, no other music than the chanting and rattling are used, and these are continued even though the violins and guitars of the matachines almost drown out their sound. The Tarahumaras themselves declare that the dutubúri and the chanting are directed to the crosses.

It is a solemn dance and certainly religious in its import. The drinking of tesgüino is usually started after the dutubúri has ended, though some overlapping of these two events may occur. On the whole, the chanter hums, the men march, and the women dance as a duty. Ever man wants to march back and forth with the chanter for awhile. Even tiny children are made to march or dance between older relatives. This is partly for their instruction, but more with an idea of completing family participation.

Many of the Tarahumaras-at the present time use the terms dutubúri and yúmari interchangeably. However, a ceremonial dance was performed at the end of most fiestas which was so definite that I described it with the phrase: “the crossing of the patio.” This ceremony was identified as yúmari (distinctly separate from dutubúri ) by an old peyote doctor, and his description corresponds to the description given by Lumholtz.

This ceremony is performed at the close of the fiesta, and many of the performers appear to be slightly intoxicated, though no one seems to care.",0,1,0,1,1,0
Ritual49,The Wake,"During the night the body is ‘watched’ by male relatives and friends and the closest adult female relatives. At least one of these persons, almost always male, maintains a vigil by the side of the body, while the others usually sit in the kitchen. It is not unusual for many men to arrive after closing time (9.0 p.m.) of the public house, carrying half-bottles of whisky and bottles of beer, to supplement the supply of liquor already procured by the chief mourner. Contrary to popular opinion in many parts of Britain, these wakes are not drunken parties. The men sit in the kitchen discussing male topics -- seamanship, fishing, sheep, etc., -- taking turns in sitting beside the ‘remains’ for spells of a quarter-hour or so. The few women present are usually busy preparing snacks and cleaning up about the kitchen. There is no singing or ‘keening’. On several occasions during the night watch, all move from the kitchen to the death room; there the Catholics kneel and pray aloud. On such occasions Protestant mourners normally stand silently, with bowed heads, at the back of the kneeling group. No particular person is responsible for deciding when these periods of prayer are to occur, but it is always a close relative of the deceased, and usually the chief mourner, who leads the praying, except when a priest is present.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Ritual50,Lifting and Procession to Chapel,"The 'Lifting' and Procession to Chapel

On the afternoon following the wake, usually at about 4.0 o'clock, relatives and friends in large numbers gather at the house for the ceremony of the ‘lifting’ (Gaelic an togail ) of the body into the coffin. The priest, or in his absence the chief mourner, leads the group in prayer as the coffin lid is closed over the body. At this point the manifestation of grief, especially on the part of women, is expected to reach a point only to be exceeded at the burial.

The closed coffin is placed on a rectangular board from both sides of which extend three shafts. Six men each grasp a shaft and bear the coffin in procession to the chapel. Males lead the procession, walking in pairs, followed by the coffin, behind which walk the women.

A close friend or a relative of the deceased assumes the role of procession-master, deciding the frequency and spacing of reliefs for the bearers of the coffin. Walking alongside the lines of men, he either blows a whistle or calls out when the coffin is to change hands. At his signal, the leading six men fall out of the procession, three on each side of the road, and wait there until the coffin draws level with them, when they step forward and relieve the carriers. The latter then attach themselves to the rear of the procession. The staging of reliefs is determined by the number of men present and the distance from house to chapel. When the distance is great the spells during which each group carries the coffin are longer than when the distance is short. It is significant that when the distance is very short, the procession takes a round-about route to the chapel and reliefs are staged every few-score yards or so, in order to give every male in the procession an opportunity to act as bearer.

Immediately preceding the coffin walks the chief mourner, normally the surviving male most closely related to the deceased, 3 holding a tassel at the end of a white cord which is attached to the front of the coffin. It is not unusual for two males to share the front tassel. For example, two brothers might bear the tassel of a parent's coffin; or a father might share with a surviving son the tassel of the latter's dead brother. However, it is customary for only one male, the chief mourner, to occupy this position. The closest female relative walks immediately behind the coffin, holding a similar tassel.

Except for the position of precedence accorded to the chief mourner, no other differentiation is made among the males in the procession. It would not be considered remarkable if, for example, the bank manager, a Protestant incomer of high social status, walked at the side of an unemployed labourer, a cousin of the deceased and a Catholic. Together with four others, they take their turns on opposite sides of the coffin. On the other hand, among females there is a rough but spontaneous sorting out according to nearness of kinship with the deceased, those who are most closely related walking nearest the coffin. In this way, women are grouped in elementary family units, e.g. mother walking with daughter, or sister with sister.

When a child of school age (five to fifteen years) dies, the school is closed during the time of the procession to permit fellow-pupils to attend. In such an event the closest friends of the dead child usually walk together near the coffin, although they do not carry it. Otherwise it is not normal for school-age children to participate in processions, unless the deceased was a close relative, in which case children frequently accompany their mothers.

On arrival at the chapel the procession is met by the priest. The men bare their heads as he blesses the coffin at the chapel door. Then all except leading members of the Protestant congregation, who usually disperse at this point, file into the chapel behind the coffin, which is placed on a dais in front of the main altar. After a few prayers the mourners depart, leaving the body in the empty chapel until the Requiem Mass next morning.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Ritual51,Funeral and Burial,"Funeral and Burial

A person whose death occurs on a Thursday or Friday is considered fortunate, for it is usual in such cases to hold the funeral and burial on Sunday morning after the High Mass, for which there is always a large congregation. Thus the most undistinguished person might have hundreds of mourners at his funeral, for it is understood that everyone at the Mass should participate, unless there is good reason to be absent.

I have not witnessed an occasion on which two funerals to the same cemetery occurred on the same day, but have been informed that in such an event every effort is made by the two parties concerned to arrive first at the cemetery and complete the burial before the other party does. The traditional belief is said to be that the last soul buried must guard the graveyard until the arrival of the next; the soul on guard gets no repose.

After Mass and prayers for the dead, the funeral procession sets out for the cemetery. This procession is identical with the one from home to chapel, except that the funeral proper is attended by a greater number. At the funeral of a prominent person there may be more than four hundred people present, for in such an event the ideal is for every household on the island to be represented by at least one member. The funeral proper might be regarded as more of a total-community event than the procession from house to chapel. The latter is primarily a regional and kinship event.

In the procession, the only solemnity to be observed is in the immediate vicinity of the coffin among the bearers, tassel-holders, and the first rows of women. Beyond this area, people chat quietly about the weather or current events as they walk along. One of the few island pipers plays a lament during the funeral procession if the deceased is a relative or close friend of his, or a prominent personage. Should the procession pass non-participant bystanders, the latter are expected to stand still and bow their heads as the cortège goes by. It is not unusual for old women who are not in the procession to prostrate themselves at the roadside, their backs to the passing coffin.

In addition to the Protestant cemetery, there are three Catholic burial places in Barra. Only one of the Catholic chapels is within sight of a Catholic cemetery; from the others the distance to the cemeteries is more than three miles. Until about twenty-five years ago it was customary for the procession to walk the entire distance from chapel to graveyard, but nowadays the greater part of the way is covered in motor cars and lorries. These are hired before-hand by the chief mourner and take up their stand at a parking place a few hundred yards away from the chapel.

As the procession arrives at the parking place, it disintegrates in an orderly fashion. As many as can be crowded into the vehicles ride to within three or four hundred yards of the cemetery. There the procession resumes on foot, augmented now by people who live close to the cemetery and have not attended the funeral Mass. At the entrance to the burial ground the males halt and face inward, the cortège passing between the lines of lowered heads and into the cemetery.

Each of the island's cemeteries has its pair of attendants who are paid a small fee by the District Council for their services. It is they who dig the grave and set up the apparatus for lowering the coffin into the ground. The coffin is brought to the grave's edge, around which the closest relatives and the priest take up positions. After the priest has sprinkled holy water on the coffin and read the prayers for the dead, the cemetery attendants lower the coffin into the ground. As this is being done, the front tassel is detached from the coffin and given to the nearest male relative. This tassel is called the ‘family relic’; it is later put into a drawer along with other souvenirs of the deceased in the home of the chief mourner. When the coffin reaches the bottom of the grave, relatives within the first and second degrees of kindred throw handsful of earth into the grave, after which the cemetery attendants shovel in the remainder of the earth. It is at this point that manifestations of grief, equal to or surpassing those shown at the lifting, are always forthcoming. It is expected that female relatives should weep and sob, but males should not.

After the burial the mourners disperse to the graves of their relatives, kneeling before each grave to pray. Normally graves are grouped in family plots, rented from the County Council. Each conjugal or elementary family, it is felt, should have its own plot. Ideally, the parents and unmarried offspring are buried under one modest headstone or cross. Husband and wife should be buried side by side. Their married sons should be destined for burial in their own plots; their married daughters in the plots of their husbands. Of course, this arrangement is not always realized in practice. There is a tendency among a few families, said to be a survival from what are locally called the ‘patriarchal’ days, to gather deceased members into a large patrilineal plot. For instance, in one such case, the following relatives and descendants of Mr X, who died in 1898, are buried in a large plot which he first rented: his wife, two of his unmarried offspring, two of his married sons, their wives, and one of his unmarried grandsons. However, allowing for a few exceptions of this nature, it is still the ideal that the elementary or conjugal family of parents and unmarried offspring should share a group of graves segregated from other elementary families, just as it is the ideal today among the living for household membership to be based on elementary family relationships.

After visiting their relatives' graves, the mourners either walk or are conveyed by vehicles to their homes. The closest relatives of the deceased return to the death house where they are visited by more distant relatives. It is usual for all kinsmen within the third degree to pay this ‘comfort visit’, as it is called. The visitors are given liquor, tea, biscuits, and cakes.

Normally it is during this session of mutual commiseration that mementoes of the deceased are distributed among the relatives present. Some of these objects are of considerable material value, e.g. jewellery, watches, and tools. Their passage normally follows the same lines as does the inheritance of croft and household, that is, they are kept within the family of procreation of the deceased. However, other articles, such as prayer-books, photographs, sacred medals, etc., are distributed more widely, to relatives outside the elementary family -- nieces, nephews, cousins, etc. In many families, a few articles of the dead person's clothing are neatly folded and put away in a drawer in the sitting room. These garments will never be worn again. Along with the tassel (the family relic) and other souvenirs, they are simply put aside and brought out only on rare occasions to be shown to those who were close to the deceased or to his descendants.

There is no avoidance of the dead person's name, but whenever mentioned it is almost always followed by some such pious ejaculation as ‘God rest him!’ There are no strict rules governing the wearing of mourning symbols and the length of mourning periods. Grown offspring of the deceased should not attend concerts and dances for a year after the death. First-degree male adult relatives usually wear a black tie for a few weeks after the death. Some continue to wear the black tie or a black diamond patch on the jacket sleeve for a year after the death. Some widows with fully-grown children wear black or dark garments for the rest of their days, but most abandon mourning clothes a few months or so after their spouse's death. This does not mean that the dead are quickly forgotten or that they cease to occupy a ritual status in the social structure. For two years after his death, the name of the deceased is spoken aloud by the priest during the overture to High Mass on Sundays in the chapel to which he belonged. For one year after his death, his name is spoken aloud by the priests in the other Catholic congregations of the island.

First-degree relatives of a dead person usually offer a Mass on his behalf on the anniversaries of his death. Each Sunday the priest announces the names of departed members on whose behalf Masses have been offered during the approaching week. If not referred to specifically by name, the deceased is included in the general category of ‘the faithful departed’ for whom prayers are said at every service. In these prayers, God is asked to have mercy on those souls that still languish in purgatory and to lift them into heaven. In private prayers the deceased may be asked to intercede on behalf of the living. Although it is felt that some souls are condemned to hell, and cannot thus intercede, as I pointed out earlier no particular soul is ever assumed to be in hell, no matter what the conditions under which the individual lived and died. Unselfconsciously it is assumed that any given individual is eventually completely absorbed into the highest of the sacred spheres, the most remote from the earthly abode, at which point the cycle that began with birth is completed.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Ritual52,Là na Ceísd (The Day of the Question),"The Friday of Communion Week is observed as ‘ Là na Ceísd ’ (‘The Day of the Question’). The service takes the form of public discussion of a text or a religious problem. It is extemporary and unrehearsed -- even if an elder or a senior member may have a question in reserve in case no other is forthcoming. Almost invariably there is. When the officiating minister invites a member with a religious problem to declare, at least two or three rise and the first to declare his ‘question’ is invited to propose it. The minister considers the problem and declares it a fit question to be raised. He invites one of his fellow ministers together with him in the pulpit to give the first exegesis. This may be a new minister, or one who is not otherwise often heard in the particular church. The minister then asks congregational elders, missionaries and in particular visiting church members to speak. As may be appreciated, this is above all an occasion for new and unaccustomed voices to join those who are otherwise frequently to be heard. New perspectives can be admitted. Thus both in secular and spiritual spheres, outside contacts are brought into the centre of local life. Fresh ideas may, albeit under social control, prevent local practice from atrophy. ‘ Là na Ceisd ’ is an all-Gaelic occasion which places great premium on ‘the word’ and in which great store is laid upon succinct and expressive speech. The idea is to be pithy and brief, giving time for as wide a variety of contributions to be made as possible. A missionary noted for his long-winded sermons may have his say in three minutes flat -- and may be thought to have said more in the three minutes than his accustomed hour. However, Harris is one of the last places to retain the ‘ ceísd ’ service (in the Church of Scotland at least). It is passing as a central feature of communions as modern patterns of transport, holidays and employment reduce attendance.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual53,"Feast of Yulyuz to the Saint, Lalla Aziza","The Rite

First, there are, as has been seen, two great sacrifices to Lalla Aziza. The one is inserted in the naturist calendar already opened by all the collections of the first fruits, of which it is in a way the culminating act. It is generally called tighersiwin , “the immolations,” and it takes place on the 15th of yulyuz , the “July” of the Julian calendar. The other coincides with the nativity of the Prophet, this Mîlâd , whose institution in Morocco and systematic generalization by the Mérinides toward the fifteenth century invaded little by little all of North Africa and became the orthodox repository for a multitude of orgiastic rites. At Z'init' the appearance and the meaning of these two manifestations differ notably. Let it be judged.

The feast of yulyuz consists of the sacrifice of bovines processionally offered by Idma, Imt'ddan, a. Musa, a. Mh'and, and sometimes a. Lh'sen and a. H'adduyws.

The beasts are assembled upstream from the tomb, above the cemetery of sidi bu Lqnadel, who would be, one will remember, H'addo, the eponym of the Haut Seksawa. Then the procession begins to sing a Prophetic litany, doubtlessly intended to furnish the othodox endorsement of the ceremony. “In your honor, Moh'ammed! It is the Prophet whom we place at our head.” This formula is used elsewhere in similar ceremonies; it is heard in any case at Ammern. The crowd arrives at an area equipped as a market on the parvis of the tomb. Each chief slits the throat of his beast. The victim jumps in movements eagerly viewed by the crowd, which confers omen value upon them. The chief washes his hands and his dagger in an earthen vessel that is presented to him. A savage scene. The beasts lie with throat cut open, exhaling a forge's blowing through their open tracheae, while dogs lap up the blood that spreads. Then the invocation starts, at which the moqaddem presides and which consists of hopes for family, agricultural, and political prosperity. The sacrifice is what it is classically on similar occasions in other regions of Morocco. The only two things to be noticed are the initial gathering above sidi bu Lqnadel (connection with the old royal cycle?) and the direction of the procession. It is carried out from upstream downstream, even for the offerings from the plain. This latter trait and the mediocrity of the affluence contrast radically with what happens at the feast of the Mîlâd.

At this time the richness and the precision of the rite are more perceptible, and the atmosphere without any doubt richer. The victim is a cow, offered by the Imt'ddan and their a. Irro emigrants. Perhaps because they are the original group of the saint or, better, the substitute for this group. The victimary is traditionally furnished by the family of the a. Baqqa, from Tagunit (Imt'ddan). It is also this taqbilt that supplies the flagellants. The procession departs from downstream, below the mosque. Same Prophetic litany. The victim is led, the one sacrificing it holding it by the left horn, a naked dagger in the right, as far as below the “house of Lalla Aziza.” The house has an inner court and a high open chamber as loggia, and where women are gathered, as they are on the neighboring terraces. The whole infinitely motley. People armed with bludgeons precede the cow a little. They face it, screaming and brandishing bare sticks or olive branches. The victimary slits the throat of the beast. If the latter rises in a jump, good omen. Cries, ho hos /Fr. youyous /, and confusion, amidst which a marabout from Assttif says the fâth'a , while the victim is skinned. It disappears under a yelling cluster of the faithful who rush beneath the blows to tear away some skin, some meat, by hand or with a knife. Upon the arrival of the cow, an old woman kissed it between the two horns. As soon as the blood spurts forth, there is a rush: one fills a bottle with it, another besmears his face, many the eyes. Simultaneously, the throats of two sheep are slit, one offered by Assttif, the other by Wanchkrir. The blood of hens colors, however, the downstream threshold of the zaouia. Then the degree of emotion, perceptible from the beginning, becomes extreme. Excitement reaches its peak. The animal, finally dismembered, is put to cook in the large pots that the house shelters. Divided into fragments, it will be carried in all directions by those present, who will sanctify new kitchens at home with it, a single little piece sufficing to bestow the benefic effluvium on a whole dish.

Despite the atmosphere of apprehension, a diagram of worship allows itself, as can be seen, to be recognized. Determination of the minister: he belongs to a family of the Imt'ddan, so close to the saint, to whom they attribute among other miracles the distribution of the springs among their villages. Association of an accessory agent who is precisely the vehicle of orthodoxy: the marabout of Assttif, whose intervention, it is not useless to recall, is necessarily quite late, since his zaouia goes back only to the seventeenth century. The veritable ministers here are this pack of individuals, associates and rivals at the same time in the dispute with blows for the conquest of a hallowed parcel. They are no longer, as in the rite of July, collective members of the tribal gathering, but volunteers. The usual techniques of collective exaltation, contrasting, in their tumultuary individualization, with the official order of July, stand out splendidly here. The real paroxysm evidently results from the violence with which the faithful hack away and tear at the victim beneath the blows.

The first interpretation, one of our own making, is naturally rationalist and modest: the people would be atoning for their sins through the mortification of blows with sticks. But it is more precise to relate this rite to so many other agrarian rites calling for struggles or violence. Flagellation even intervenes there at times, linked to the ideas of the scapegoat and purification. Not far away in the Atlas, at sidi Brahim near Asni, a camel is similarly slaughtered and skinned by the faithful, who tear at its flesh under the blows. At sidi Âbdallah u H'sayn, of Tameçluh't, the head of the animal is carried away and fought over on the run by two rival parties Finally, the communional aspect which the distribution of the meat suggests and which in other ceremonies a laic or municipal climate attenuates or eliminates, bursts out here in all its zeal. In the region one would find such a force only at the October musem of sidi Âli u Brahim of the Idaw T'anan: the dispute is unleashed, not around a skinned victim, but around a paste to be eaten collectively.

In sum, the Mîlâd of Z'init', with an exceptional clearness and richness, comes under the jurisdiction of these rites by which rural societies perform “an uninterrupted series of concentrations and diffusions” of the sacred, with the aim of assuring the continuation of the life of things and of drawing closer the relations of this life with that of the group. A difficulty, however, and even an anomaly. Not so much that the ceremony assumes an Islamic coloring; that is only normal. But how is one to explain that it has been dissociated from the July ceremony? The latter has remained purely civic and naturist. Its content has become impoverished, thinner. On one hand, seasonal insertion and official intervention of the groups. On the other, patronage of the Prophet, justifying, in an intense, ecstatic debauch, an old rite which is at the same time agrarian, expiatory, and communional. When did this dissociation intervene? The feast of yulyuz , also called musem or even muslem , would have been instituted less than a century ago, as other Seksawa musem -s have been subsequently. However that may be, the incontestable fact lies in the contrast between the two ceremonies and this kind of division of labor which operates between them. Let us take note of this characteristic, amenable to these meticulous balances or divisons that one finds so frequently in Chleuh /Shluh/ society, each time that it compounds with something that is not itself. In the case at hand, there is moreover a notation on the enormous problem of the division between the profane and the sacred on one hand, and, on the other, between the different sources of sacred, which takes place in this milieu with the accountant and classificator genius.

The dispute of the Mîlâd is related, as has been seen, to the very name of the place, pronounced with a doubling of the initial, z'z'init , and interpreted as an invitation of the saint to quarrel over her body. Is this not an etymological pun, or is the rite itself only a liturgical exposition of the name? The first interpretation seems preferable. If one relates a legendary trait, that of the rivalry over the body of the saint to a ritual trait, the dispute over the body of the victim, the possibility of assimilation, quite classical, between one body and the other comes to mind. That would carry the explanation into a very old atmosphere. It would naturally be imprudent to conclude on such a hypothesis. At the very most it would have the merit of achieving the displaying of the virtualities of the rite and its full religious resonance, of a richness unusual in the Maghreb.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual54,Naming Ceremony,"The ceremony of naming baby boys is very interesting. Early in the morning the family and friends, with the little one coated and ornamented with feathers of crimson and white, accompanied by a priest, take up a position on the highest ground near the village. At sunrise, the priest pierces the lower lip of the embryo warrior with a long, sharp, bone-pointed instrument made for the occasion and decorated with many-colored feathers. At the same time he pronounces “Piadudu” or the name of some bird, animal, or object whose name the child is to bear. “Piadudu,” softly repeat the family and friends, and thus “Piadudu,” humming-bird, a favorite name, becomes the name of the child. They are very jealous of their names and will not make them known to any one not belonging to their tribe, always when asked responding “parduko”--I do not know. A woman is totally disfranchised and can scarcely consider herself a citizen. She is merely an adjunct to the man.",0,1,0,0,0,0

Ritual56,Funerary Proceedings: Death and Funerals,"Death and Funerals

When a boróro is already not eating and, his condition worsening, the bari has already pronounced death very close, the relatives anoint the entire body with urucú, decorate it with feathers and plumes, as on the days of great celebration. The patient having gone into the death agony, those present start a song in a low voice, almost recitative, and the relatives come, one by one, to the head of the one in agony and put a hand on his forehead, repeating in a low voice the words of the song: Pobo mugúia manno tadda ... After the relatives, any other person who wishes to show love, esteem, and compassion towards the beloved person who is about to die passes by, placing his hand on the forehead of the moribund.

The placing of the hand on the forehead seems to indicate the act of closing the eyes of the moribund to all the things of this world, from which he is about to part forever. As soon as he dies, he is covered, because he must not be seen by the women and children. Then the cries and lamentations rise very high and are heard in the whole aldeia. The relatives mercilessly cut their bodies with a sharp shell. The cuts are so deep that the blood gushes out in profusion and runs over the cadaver. It is an impressive scene, which cannot be attended without horror and is repeated several times in the course of the funeral.

Meanwhile a monotonous and slow funeral song starts, to the rhythm of the bapo , in the maloca. Bapo is an empty elliptic gourd in which they place some hard seeds. It has a wooden handle. The noise produced by the seeds is quite intense and serves to mark the beat of the songs and dances. The one who directs the singing holds two bapos; the one in the right hand is shaken with greater speed and marks the syllables of the song, the one in the left gives it the rhythm.

Meanwhile the dead one is wrapped and tied to a straw mat. His personal objects of some importance, such as ornaments and bow and arrow, are placed on the mat in order to be burned at the end of the funeral rites.

Many times the man breaks his own bow over the bier of the wife and of the children.

At sunset the cadaver is transported to the bororo (patio), where the official funeral rites start. The chiefs of the aldeia, adorned with pariko, facing the setting sun, play the bapo, sing the roia kurireu, “great song,” the same for all the clans, except for slight modifications.

Afterwards the different dynasties have their own songs follow uninterruptedly until daybreak; thus the whole night is spent in a continuous and monotonous halloo, accompanied by the muffled rhythm of the bapo . After a brief rest, in the morning, the tireless mourners continue their singing, as soon as the sun reappears, and do not stop until sunset.

Temporary Burial — Mourning

Early on the following day, while some young men prepare a grave from thirty to forty cms. in depth in the plaza of the aldeia, next to the baimannagueggeu , the relatives group around the dead one, and, with loud lamentations, they slash themselves anew, bent over the cadaver, spraying him with fresh blood. Then the dead one is taken to the place prepared and temporarily buried at the surface of the ground. Every day at sunset the relatives will go to sprinkle the sepulcher with abundant water, in order to hasten putrefaction and the defleshing of the bones.

Meanwhile the mourning of the relatives starts. The closest ones will pull out their hair; some cut it. The hair is saved and will be used later to make a plait called ae . The hair grown while the mourning lasts is not cut in the front or in the back. They do not paint themselves with urucú and the women remove the kogu and the koddobie , which are replaced by the uaigo and okuamíe , respectively.

The period of mourning lasts for months, a year or longer, and it stops when the relatives get hold of the mourner, cut his hair horizontally on the forehead at the height of the ears; then they paint him completely with urucú and adorn his head with the usual multicolored feathers.

The women again put on the kogu and the koddobie. These operations are done by surprise and at times against their will. It is worth noting the use of some violence with which they usually force the same relatives to abandon mourning.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual57,"Funerary Proceedings: When a ""Mori"" Ounce is Killed","When a ""Mori"" Ounce is Killed

When an Indian kills an ounce for a dead person, he does this: he takes the hide to the middle of the plaza of the aldeia and leaves it there and then he goes to seek the brother of the dead one for whose mori he killed the ounce. He holds the hand of the individual and takes him there where the hide is to be found and leaves him there. Then he takes the skin of the ounce and goes running in circles around that man with the hide, shouting: kae, kae kae; kae, kae, kae, and hands the hide to the relative of the dead one and says: emareo, emareo, emareo, a vie racuddu a manna racuddu, a tuie racuddu mori; a kudau, a kuie, a kao gagegeu adugo reno, which means: here is the ounce, the mori of your younger brother, of your older brother, or of your sister and says the proper name of the person. Afterwards this man waves the hide of the animal a little, and, if he is a Bokodori exeraeddo, he will sing like this: ui, ui, ui, iwororo meriribo bororo, iwororo iwororo Okoguebo boróro, iwororo Xibaibo bororo, Akirio bororo, iwororo iwororo poremoddu boróro, pore Kuri bororo, uibo bororo, Araruga bororo, iwororo Cado u Cadogubororo, iwororo, iwororo iwororo Coibo bororo barubo bororo. These words mean: ui! ui! ui! my patio the patio of metal: my patio my patio the patio of the golden; my patio the patio of the red araras: the patio of the down; my patio, my patio, the patio of the cataract which disappears in the ground: the patio of the big cataract; the patio of a black fish, of the arariga; my patio the patio of the Cadou Cadogubo; my patio, my patio, my patio the patio of the Coibo and the patio of the clean field.

He continues, always repeating the name of those patios more slowly, until all shout: Wo! Then he continues: iwororo, iwororo iwororo Meriribo bororo aiduia, itugaregue enouo ikudau, ikuie itao gagegeu ai o. And always repeating these same words, he continues the song, only changing the name of the patios. Here is the translation: my patio, my patio, my patio the patio of metal in which my subjects brought the hide of mine, the tooth of mine, my head ornament. At this point he pronounces the name of the departed: iaboereu rakudu, iaboereddo aé taúge mato, -- oh, so-and-so, show yourself around here, ixare aiaddumague, ixare ao mague, ere ake oka, ere ake rie, ere ake kurubeguru, ere kireru buttuddo auguege toro, reodoguere are etarego mato, jugodoguere etarego mato, jorubore are barigu toro. Once these words are finished, all shout: Wo! Now here is the translation: Now your parents made your food the wolf cub, they made your food the wolf, they made your food the fox, they made bleed for you their blood, make fish come, make pigs come, and cast the illness far away.

Afterwards the father or a brother-in-law of the departed takes the hide to his home. Soon there comes to sing with the bapo kurireu the one who was singing there in the middle over the hide of the ounce the song that begins: bakororo ika buttore etc. Afterwards they sing some songs of the roia guigudu and roia umanareu.

As soon as the singing is finished, the mother or sister of the departed goes to call her older and younger brothers in order to see who is going to possess the hide and the claws of the ounce. It is already more or less known that it is the mother or the sister of the deceased who receives the tooth. Once the possessor of the hide and of the claws has been chosen, they return again to their own huts, and at nightfall the one who received the hide calls to his brothers-in-law to stretch the hide of the ounce very soon and says further to the chiefs, young men and young women, boys and girls, old men and old women that they should be ready to sing and dance on the hide of the ounce. All applaud with shouts and whistles.

Later some lads seek out the bapodogue, the parikodogue and hand over a bapo to the chief who is going to sing the song of the xibaetawaddu. Thus begin the songs and the dance which will last until daybreak.",1,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual58,Funerary Proceedings: The Mori of the Spotted Ounce,"The Mori of the Spotted Ounce

The man who received the hide of the ounce is required to make a bow and arrows and various ornaments of his own clan for the person who killed the ounce. After fifteen or eighteen arrows have been made among the brothers of the one who is going to receive the hide of the ounce, then other ornaments are begun, that is, the poguekegeugue and still other things.

On the eve of the day when the mori is going to be delivered, the one who will receive the hide will advise everyone, and thus everyone will take part in this celebration. He also advises some brothers-in-law to decorate the bow of the slayer and to make a poari. He also advises the slayer that he shall bathe at a time close to the mori and also that he shall pierce and arrange the teeth of the ounce. He will advise the mother or a close female relative to prepare abundant drink of iworo (wine of the acurí palm) or a great quantity of drinks of kuiadda kuru, etc. He recommends to all that they take part in this celebration.

In the evening there are some songs about the hide of the ounce. On the following day they decorate the bow and the poari , while the women prepare the drinks. In the afternoon the relatives of the one who will receive the hide gather in the home of the mother or of the female relative of the departed, for whom the ounce was killed. Then one takes the bapo kurireu and sings the Bakororo ika butore over the hide, the arrows, the decorations and poari . During an interval in the singing, they go to seek the slayer of the ounce, who is at the home of the mother or relative, where all the relatives of the slayer are gathered. They take him by the hand and lead him to the house where the relatives of the departed are gathered, singing. Upon leaving the one hut and entering the other, he is greeted with a loud shout: Wo !

A female relative of the slayer grabs the hide of the ounce and leaves, running toward the place where the relatives of the slayer are gathered, and there they place on the edges of the hide some feathers of the arara and other birds. If the slayer had been in mourning, at this moment they cut his hair on the forehead, paint him very heavily with urucú from head to foot, while they sing the Atugododdu . This song is followed by the Marenaruie, the same song that was rendered at the time of the death agony of the departed one for whom the ounce was killed. With this song the women who know how to dance, dance holding the hand of the slayer, who is going to receive the mori .

Once the dance is finished, one takes the bow decorated with feathers, the arrows, and runs around the slayer, shouting: kae kae kae, kae kae, kae, emareu emareu emareu, avoiga reno, atugo reno, that is: here it is, here is your bow and your arrow. Upon handing him the bow, they say solemnly: You killed the ounce to win these things thus so ugly; for you to win these things so ugly, you endured hunger, thirst, heat, and cold; you made stones, sticks strike your body, you made thorns scratch your body and blood come out. Keep them, do not turn it back any more, nobody will say anything to you, because I was the one who did it.

Then they give him the poari and, after they whistle, hang it around his neck. They put the lip ornaments on him, the feather ornaments on his head. As soon as they finish adorning him, the mother or the female relative of the departed one gives him fresh water to drink, what is left being taken away by a female relative of the slayer. The brother-in-law or the father of the slayer, holding the arrows and ornaments, take the slayer by the hand and lead him home.

All the female relatives of the one for whom the ounce was killed take the drinks prepared there in the middle of the plaza. If they are tugaregue, then the tugaregue will take these drinks first and then the exerae will follow; if they are exerae , they will take them first.

Once everything has been taken to the plaza, the mother or the female relative of the departed one for whom the ounce was killed goes to take by the hand the slayer of the ounce and thus also do the other women go to take by the hand the men, youths, and even the women who have already killed mori ounces and take them to sit down in order for the banquet to start.

As a last ceremony the slayer of the ounce goes to look for the hide, the teeth, and the claws of the ounce and places them in the middle of the patio and afterwards betakes himself to a higher chief, takes him by the hand, and leads him close to the hide and hangs the hide in front of him, together with the teeth and the claws (arranged in a semicircle, like a crown), he places them on his head. The man with the hide hanging in this way, turning to the west, says, hitting the hide with the feet: “ Ui, ui, ui, ui .” Turning to the east, he repeats the same words, and then again to the west, he says: “ Ui, ui, ui, akare bakororo, akare bakororo, kuddu, akare kare imi (now quite fast) ui, ui, akare bakororo, akare akare iparexeba , etc., saying some names of the badogeba xebeguiugue . Continuing, he says: “ O (here all also shout together: “ O ”) O bakororo, o bakororo Oroaribo aiduia itugaregue enouo ikudau, ikuie etaugagegeu ai. o, o Kugarubo Kugarubo padarobo aiduia itugaregue enouo ikudau, ikuie etaugagegeu ai o, o. “-- He continues the song, which is quite long, while the others eat. When they are finished, all shout: Wo !

The slayer of the ounce again receives the teeth, the claws, and the hide of the ounce and hands the hide over to the one for whom it was already intended; the teeth for the mother or for a female relative of the departed, and the claws for a lad related to the departed. And thus is finished the mori of the ounce.",1,1,0,0,1,0

About fifteen days after the burial, when the bones are becoming defleshed, at twilight the songs start again up to dawn of the next day. Around noon the young men start the game of the mariddo .

Mariddo , according to the legend, was an Indian of such strength that he danced for hour after hour, supporting with his arms on his head an enormous and heavy bundle of thin sticks about half a meter long. Up to today, in his memory, the Indians make a cylindrical bundle, with stalks of palm leaves, measuring about 1 1/2 m. in diameter and 0.50 in thickness (see photograph on p. 467.)

The young men, arranged in a circle, lift it with difficulty, and they try to dance in this position, keeping step with the beat of the bapo. Few manage to take any steps, and the enormous bundle falls amidst the very lively hilarity of the spectators. It is a traditional game which does not go with the seriousness and sadness of the rest of the funeral rites.",1,0,0,0,1,0

At twilight the lamentations recommence, which again last the entire night, without interruption. It is not without reason that the orarimogodogue look for medicinal plants to put off sleep and give strength for these long nocturnal songs!

At dawn, to the singing of the kiegue baregue, “birds and beasts,” the mat that contains the cadaver is disinterred and opened, and is taken to the nearby river or lagoon.

Burial in the Water

One morning the one who takes the part of uiaddo , together with the relatives of the dead one, takes the basket of bones, goes to a nearby river or lagoon already determined. There, where the waters are deeper, they lower the basket and fix it fast on the bottom with a stick which comes out of the water. This lagoon is the aroe iao , “dwelling of the souls.” During the time of the funeral, many Indians adorn themselves, painting themselves completely in red or fitting on the body, especially on the head, ornaments prepared previously.

Many others fasten multicolored feathers directly to the body with the resin called kiddoguru : the feathers stay so secure that they become loose only after many days. For this reason, weeks after the funeral, one sees men and women with remnants of ornaments. The type of feathers used and their arrangement vary according to the clan to which they belong.

This is a very brief summary of the very complicated ceremonial used in the funeral rites, which is sufficient to prove that the religious idea of these Indians is in the cult of the souls, aroe . This should serve as a complement to what has already been said in relation to their religion.

Ritual62,Flaming Bones,"Flaming Bones'

Still among the most frequently used medicines in Truk today is the one associated with the spirit power ‘Flaming bones’ ( Cunuget). The most prominent feature of this spirit power is the knowledge of certain kinds of sorcery used exclusively in warfare. Although there hasn’t been any warfare in Truk in decades, and consequently no need for the kinds of sorcery applicable during hostilities, the power of the sorcery that used to be practiced lingers on, and is believed to have continuing effects in making people sick.

There were generally three main techniques possible in carrying out the sorcery associated with this spirit power. The first and most powerful method utilized the body of one of the enemy who had been slain in battle. If such a corpse could be obtained, it was carried to the border area between the two hostile villages. The corpse was then lashed to the trunk of a breadfruit or coconut tree in an upright position, so that it faced in the direction of the hostile village from whence it had come. The mouth was propped open, the lips pulled back or cut off to expose the teeth, the eyelids cut off, and other things done to the corpse to make it look as horrible, fierce and frightening as possible.

Then various foods, especially fish, were brought and placed at the feet of the corpse as an offering to its spirit. These were designed, not to placate the spirit, but to make it hostile and angry. Thus the offerings might include such creatures as sharks, barracuda, sting rays and barbed, stinging or poisonous fish of all kinds.

The corpse was also treated with medicines, which were placed in the nose, mouth, or elsewhere in the body. These too were intended to make the spirit hot and angry. Finally, the man who knew all the procedures appropriate to this spirit power might recite a spirit chant to further incite the corpse’s spirit, and increase its vengeful, attacking power.

Two other alternatives were available if a corpse could not be obtained to carry out these procedures. An image could either be carved out of a block of breadfruit or the petiole of a coconut frond ( pareniiaw) could be decorated with teeth and eyes in order to make it look like a corpse or vengeful spirit. These images could then be treated with medicine and offerings in a manner similar to that meted out to an actual corpse, the images being intended as a practical substitute for the physical body and spirit of an enemy.

Although these corpses and fabricated images were sometimes carried on war canoes, they were most often lashed to a certain tree or set down in a particular spot and left there. They are consequently collectively known as anusoosoo, ‘planted spirits’ or ‘set down spirits’ ( anu-soosoo). The same term, soosoo, is used for planting or setting down fire, which is usually carried around on a burning brand until it is set down someplace. Nowadays, Trukese confuse this term with sowsow, which means to meet, greet or intercept. Thus anusowsow refers to any spirits that tend to remain in one place and intercept passersby. These include the spirits of Flaming bones, bad human spirits, reef spirits and many others. We stress this distinction because many people fail to discriminate between ‘planted spirits’ ( anusoosoo), which stem solely from Flaming bones, and ‘intercepting spirits,’ a generic term for all kinds of frightening spirits that can lie in wait to attack the unsuspecting as they pass or linger nearby.

Each of these ‘set down spirits’ usually bore the name of the deceased enemy or other spirit it was supposed to represent. Many of these individually named spirits can still be recalled today, together with the general or specific area in which they continue to dwell and to bring harm to the unsuspecting sojourner. It just so happens, for example, that the modern Truk District Hospital has been located in an area on Moen Island that is considered to be full of these spirits. The hospital is located on a saddle between two hills, where the boundaries of Mw˙a˙an, Iir˙as, T˙unn˙uk and Meccitiw villages come together. This was the scene of heavy fighting in the past, and the site where a great many ‘set down spirits’ were located. Difficulties that patients sometimes encounter in the hospital, most especially the birth of a deformed child, which is an almost unequivocal symptom of this spirit power, are often attributed to the action of these spirits.

Other recipes, in this and other formulas, use many other ingredients, including noxious-smelling substances intended to drive away or frighten the spirit from the patient, as well as ingredients symbolically related to associated symptoms and the condition of illness.

While there is some agreement between different informants with regard to medical ingredients considered appropriate, there is much less agreement with respect to avoidances. One person noted that pweias, a species of pampano, was a permanent avoidance, while others said there were no permanent avoidances. Still another noted, with an unstated symbolism that should now be obvious, that all fish with barbs or spines capable of pricking or stinging should be avoided during treatment. Several other land and sea foods are also mentioned as treatment avoidances.

As noted, the medicines of this spirit power remain in wide use today, largely because the ‘set down spirits’ are believed to retain much of their power to harm anyone who comes too close. However, it is not necessary to go near one of these spirits to be affected by their power. One may become ill merely by getting too close when ‘Flaming spirits’ medicine is being prepared, or by climbing one of its medicine trees, or stepping in one of its medicinal fires, or by violating a permanent avoidance after having been treated, and so on.

Ritual65,Maziga Ceremony,"“In times of drought, when there is danger that the crops may die from lack of moisture, or in times of serious pestilence, a ceremony takes place at the suggestion of ghostdiviners ( aboro atoro) who are instructed to initiate it by directions from Mbori or from the ghosts of the dead in dreams, in cultivations and at sources of streams. However it is necessary that the prince’s poison oracle shall confirm their dreams before the ceremony takes place, and if the poison oracle gives confirmation the prince tells his deputies to instruct the ghost-diviners to organise locally in each district a ceremony which is usually called maziga. Ghost-diviners are people who are able to communicate with the ghosts of the dead, usually through dreams, and are generally women.

....Captain Philipps, who has watched it taking place, writes, ‘The bearers of the offering of first fruits had, in this instance, been called for by the chief amid an approbation of the people in increasing procession from house to house. Thence they moved with simple cadenced song towards the open table rock which gives birth to the source of the river and looks out over the whole countryside. The songs appeared to consist of chorused invocations of a very limited variety. Considerable alarm and despondency were created during our stay at the neighbouring village by a bursting storm which, occuring during the night, washed off a large proportion of the offerings into the stream below. Passing next morning about dawn on my way to shoot, I was an attentive witness and hearer of the impromptu meeting held on the spot by the earliest passers-by’ (177). He says that the ceremony is usually held about December in the Zande month of Bandulo, the month of mists, but if this is so it can hardly be intended to counteract drought as the [21] Azande do not plant their crops till the end of March, and as in December the millet is ripening in the cultivations the last thing they want is rain. Mgr. Lagae says that it is held at the commencement of the dry season and only once a year but not necessarily each year (71). This is a time when drought may destroy the millet harvest since it is still growing and needs moisture. Similarly I was told that it was held either when the young shoots of millet needed moisture (if it is planted in August) or in the springtime (about May, in the Zande month of malekoko) for the benefit of all crops.

Major Larken describes the ceremony as in honour of Baati and not of Mbori. His description is as follows (1): ‘In the case that came under the writer’s notice, no altar was raised, but only a small space was swept at the rocky lip of a ravine, and in that space a heap consisting of leaves of pineapple, bananas, elusine, sweet potatoes, ground-beans, kpagu and ngbazi, had been placed by the people.

“I have only once had the opportunity of witnessing the maziga ceremony.... On this occasion, in the month of August, there was a severe outbreak of cerebro-spinal meningitis which caused many deaths. The prince, Gangura, had consulted his poison oracle to find out whether the epidemic would cease if the maziga ceremony were held, and learning that this would be the result he sent for a well-known ghost-diviner and instructed her to commence the ceremony, which she organised with the aid of several other women ghost-diviners. In the early morning the women of several settlements collected in the house of the leading ghost-diviner and from there commenced to visit neighbouring cultivations through which they charged, rushing in all directions, shouting and singing, and swinging sticks into the air to bring them down with strokes to the earth in time to their songs. Besides sticks they carried in their hands leaves of manioc, sweet potatoes, and other food plants which [22] they gathered from homesteads and cultivations as they passed through them. They were preceded in this romp through gardens and cultivations by a small boy beating on a leather-topped drum. Men kept out of their way partly because it was not their business to take part in a woman’s ceremony and partly because the women become excited and do not observe, indeed are not expected to observe, the usual rules of seemly conduct. The spirit-diviners and others among the women who accompany them perform a kind of belly dance which in ordinary times would be considered indecent and would not be allowed. I was told also that these ghost-diviners may make obscene gestures with their hands and utter expressions which are only permitted on rare occasions of prescribed licence.

The women finally gathered together in a homestead at the edge of the settlement in which I lived and I hurried out to meet them as soon as I heard that they were there. Only women took part in the ceremony and the few men who, like myself, were onlookers, happened to live nearby and could hardly have avoided being spectators. On the whole they seemed to regard the antics of the women as a joke. These were dancing wildly in the centre of the homestead and one of them was now beating the drum. They waved leaves of food plants in their hands and beat the ground with sticks singing various songs, usually consisting of a single sentence....

No translations can be offered for the first two lines other than the explanations suggested below of the words maziga and Baati. The third line might be translated ‘Mbori has taken his son from me, Mbori ooo,’ and the fourth line as ‘My father has died Mbori alas, alas, death, we have departed.’ During the singing and dancing the leading ghost-diviner became possessed with ghosts and twitched and trembled and shook as though she had convulsions. Some of the other women beat her on the back and poked their fingers into her ears. They must have danced [23] thus for half an hour when, preceded by the leading ghost-diviner, they rushed off at the double along a path to a stream singing....

On arrival at the stream head they continued to sing for a while and to beat the drum. Finally they cleared an open space on the floor of a shallow chasm at the head of the stream. At this point the leading ghost-diviner swooned in convulsions, and the ceremony came to a conclusion. The women oiled their bodies in the bush and made themselves presentable before returning to their homesteads. I was told that on the following morning the ghost-diviners ate special medicines--ghost medicines--known only to them. The country was laid under a kind of general interdict against eating manioc leaves and the oil-bearing plant ndakö (Hyptis Spicigera-Sch.), because the senior ghost-diviner had been given an order to this effect by the Supreme Being in a dream and her dream had been confirmed by Gangura’s poison oracle.”

“According to one informant (Kuagbiaru) ‘In the past all Azande used to think about Mbori as dwelling mainly at the heads of streams rather than in other places. They also thought about Mbori as being under the earth because when a man dies they bury him in the earth where Mbori is.

In a year in which food plants do not bear well for Azande they collect on a certain day, shortly after sunrise, and go about ululating with a great noise. It is the same with rain also. If rain does not fall to make their crops grow they perform this ceremony at a stream head, because they all believe that Mbori is at the heads of streams and that if they go there to cry out for rain he will surely give it to them.

[24] But now a good number listen to the teaching of the missionaries and think that in fact Mbori is on high because the missionaries always tell them that this is so. But the people who do do not live near the Government station still retain the ideas of their fathers, for their fathers used to honour Mbori at the heads of streams in the old days. Most people still say to-day that Mbori is in fact at the heads of streams because when they go to celebrate Baati at the heads of streams Mbori will grant them rain on that day on which they go to celebrate Baati.”

“A Zande Christian (Zuzu) gave the following account of the [JMA: Baati] ceremony: ‘That which Azande used to do is as follows.... People collected together to perform the ceremony of Baati. They say that Mbori is at the heads of streams and near limonite outcrops. They performed the ceremony of maziga and rain came down and poured greatly. People went and straightway gathered (in the ceremony) all fruits, ground-nuts and sesame and sweet potatoes and leaves of manioc and fowls’ eggs and bananas and every kind of produce to perform the ceremony of maziga and Baati to bring down rain upon their crops and cultivations so that refreshed [25] by rain they might spring up, for if rain does not fall the plants will not spring up....

A third account was as follows: ‘People rise early and go out to beat maziga on account of the seedlings of plants. They say, ‘Let plants flourish, let this world be fruited to men here, because if there be no food all men will die, Mbori grant it to us who are ghost-diviners.’ They then commence to sing a song.... When they arrive in the cultivations they begin to break off heads of millet and kpagu and ground-nuts and earth-beans and mele and heads of abakpa and detiro and to collect fowls’ eggs. They beat all the cultivations and then their leader says ‘Let us go to the head of the stream to present these things to Mbori’. Well they begin to go and arrive there.

‘She tells them to remain on the bank and she collects all these things and takes them and throws them down in the chasm. Then she begins to tremble and starts the song of the ghosts for her companions and they respond to Mbori. She says to them, ‘Let us go home, the ghosts are chasing me, let us go.’ They commence to depart.’

A fourth account was compiled from statements of three women who were leaders in the ceremony I witnessed....

They said.... the ghost-diviners descend right into the chasm at the stream head. While they are there the boy beats the drum up above on the bank. They wait there for a long time and then suddenly emerge and tell the people that the ghosts praise their offerings and that their rain will fall on their millet. The ghost-diviners say that when they are in the chasm the ghosts speak to them.”

Ritual66,Healing Ritual,"In healing services it always takes a long time to build up the necessary spiritual or suggestive atmosphere. Singing, long preaching and praying, and at some centres speaking in tongues precedes it. The congregation is made to participate in the proceedings. They may pray aloud each to his own words, the sound being like the roaring of surf. They are “welded” together into a sort of power-field by laying-on of hands by an officiating prophet who is in a trance under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Palm-branches may be given to the congregation. At another prophet's centre people queue up, sing and are sprinkled with holy water. This they carefully rub in, the women opening up their blouses so as to present their breasts to the precious liquid. Then they are given some of the holy water to drink. During this lengthy process the prophet moves around and inspires the singing and drumming of the band, until the whole congregation, gently swaying, has coalesced into one mystical body. This conveys to the devotee a feeling of security and importance.

Only after these preparations does the actual direct treatment begin. This may consist of a symbolic rubbing in of holy oil on the front, the ears, the toes and the hands of the patient, thus symbolizing the healing power of Christ over the five senses and the whole of life.

Another procedure is a lengthy imposing of hands by the prophet and his assistants. The prophet speaks in tongues and the congregation sing or pray aloud.

Sometimes the idea seems to be, that the disease is an evil fluid or spirit. The prophet massages liniment and holy water on his patients during his healing services. He stares at them in a hypnotic way, takes a mouthful of water and spits it right into the face of the patient to confound the evil power of the disease. He lays on his hand, then suddenly whips it away. Towards the end of the treatment, he puts his arms around the patient, lifts him bodily from the ground, so that the spirit of disease cannot get reinforcement from the earth. He squeezes the patient energetically in order to force out the disease. Occasionally he looks at the hands of the patient, to see whether there is still evil power in him. Other prophets impose their hands on the patients speaking in tongues, e.g. ai ai ai ai amen. This they are supposed to address to the healing angels Gabriel and Raphael standing behind the patient. Then they massage patients at length from head to toe, and especially that part of the body where the pain is. Thus they claim to re-shape the patient. They massage in such a way that the spirits of disease, which they describe as fiery snakes and reptiles, are driven to the extremities of the arms or legs. There the prophet, who is reputed to see these reptiles with his spiritual eye, watchs them, grasps them with his hand and throws them away ( cp. Plates 47–49). It is said that these spiritual snakes and reptiles sometimes attack the healer and even occasionally materialize into visible snakes or lizards.

Blindness is sometimes treated with dirt from the ground, mixed with spittle, following the procedure described in the New Testament ( cp. Plate 46).

The prophets all emphatically maintain that their particular method of healing is faith-healing and that the water, oil or sand they use are not medicines, but are simple means by which the Holy Spirit acts.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Ritual67,Exorcism,"Exorcism by the Prophets

Not only do the sects offer protection and healing, they are also thought of as a powerful agency to find out witches and evil spirits and to exorcise them. Witches are said to feel themselves urged to go to the prophets and there to confess their evil doings, and to ask for deliverance from the spirit possessing them ( cp. Plate 57).

A certain prophet considers the witches his principal enemy. He boasts that he drove away an attack by all the Ghana witches. This is how he told me of this “battle of witches”: “At the beginning of December, 1953, all the witches of the world had gathered at their headquarters at Mankessim in Fanteland. It was revealed to me by God. Then I went in spirit to Mankessim where already 4,000 witches had assembled. Knowing now that the matter was really serious, I returned to A. and prepared for the spiritual warfare against the witches. On the 10th of December, the attack came. We received the witches with prayers and threw holy sand at them. It was a mighty battle, the force of the witches having swelled to 20,000 by now. We were able to ward off the attack, but the battle had so weakened me that I had to lie down for a few days till I recovered”.

It is said that only hard-boiled witches dare to leave M. (the headquarters of another church), uncured—and they can do so only by depositing their witch-spirit somewhere on the way there, and picking it up again on their return.

Preceding the actual exorcism, most prophets insist on a full confession by the supposedly possessed person, and records of these are often kept. Other prophets demand that the person to be exorcised must confess his sins aloud in a prayer to God before the congregation. In very severe cases possessed persons are made to fast prior to being exorcised.

Another prophet exorcises by a form of hypnotism. When the possessed person has confessed the congregation sing and clap their hands, the prophet and his assisting healers speak in tongues, and the congregation prays aloud. The prophet then addresses sharp hypnotic commands like “Taaa! Heh! Bah!” to the evil spirit in the person ( cp. Plate 51). The patient starts to tremble and after more of these commands begins to shake all over. The prophet then removes the possessed woman's headkerchief in order to attack the demon. She is then pulled up in a trance and begins dancing, more or less violently, according to the type of demon said to possess her. The healers form a circle round her and sing hymns to the clapping of their hands. This dancing is interpreted as a last violent reaction of the demons which are unwilling to leave her and, therefore, try to harm her, before being forced out. They may throw her to the floor, where she rolls about, sometimes trying in vain to rise again. Two women will always see that her clothes are readjusted decently. The prophet may then anoint the front of the woman with holy oil, which quietens her for a time, or walk round her, speaking in tongues, occasionally uttering his hypnotic commands, or extending his palms towards her until, breathing heavily, she falls into a sort of exhausted quietness on the floor. She is then turned so that her head points to the altar, and once more the congregation prays while her front is anointed with oil. She is then asked to say her name as a sign that she submits, and with some difficulty she does this, whispering that she—or her demon—is conquered. She is then told to sit up, and during the following prayers, elders impose their hands, and once more anoint her. The prophet then shakes hands with her and she is dismissed as cured. In exactly the same way this particular prophet also exorcises family fetishes, and spirits of the departed. One woman was considered to be possessed by the jealous spirit of her deceased husband, and this she believed to be the cause of her barrenness. After exorcism, the spirit gave a loud cry, and eventually left her ( cp. Plate 52).

At A. I witnessed the exorcism of a crowd of self-confessed witches. After a long service (preaching, announcement, testimony of an old woman said to have been raised from the dead, ordination of ministers for his church) the prophet announced that the evil spirits would now be driven out. A group of church officers and priests busied themselves gathering particulars from about forty men, women and children all eager to confess and to have their supposed witch spirits evicted ( cp. Plate 50). They were all lined up in rows, facing “towards Sierra Leone” ( cp. Plate 55).

I was told that the witch-spirits were to be driven “into the sea behind Sierra Leone”. Formerly they were said to be driven into the sea via Accra; but instead of being drowned, many witch-spirits found new homes among the Accra population. A complaint was lodged by the Accra people, hence the choice of a new direction.

Anyone who happened to be looking in the Sierra Leone direction was warned to keep out of the way for a while lest the fleeing spirits might possess one of them. The congregation struck a hand-clapping hymn, accompanied by a band, and in this way obviously built up the psychological pressure on the “witches”, who had already been instructed to kneel down. The prophet and one or two priests moved among them, here and there putting one hand on the head of a witch, and pointing with the other in the direction of “Sierra Leone”, commanding the witch spirit to go there. Some of the witches began to tremble under the psychic stress, and this was taken as a sign that the unclean spirits were beginning to feel uneasy in their bodies ( cp. Plate 56). Those spirits who persisted in resisting the prophet's influence shook their owners so severely that they fell writhing on the ground, and remained there quivering for some time. In such severe cases, the prophet or one of his assistants would sprinkle holy sand on them, particularly on their shaking limbs. By close observation, the prophet established the exact spot on limbs or head through which the witch spirit had departed. This danger point was anointed with holy oil and sacred sand to provide special protection against the counter attack. When the treatment was over, the patients lay supine like so many corpses. They were soaked by a rainstorm which had set in during the process of exorcism, and more sand was laid on to symbolize their “burial”, because they were considered as ritually “dead and buried with Christ”, so the prophet told me. Not all the witches, however, reacted so violently as this, more than half of them remained kneeling and shook only moderately or not at all. “Their witch spirits are not so bad and leave earlier” I was told.

The ceremony eventually came to an end. Those “dead and buried” were “raised up to new life” by the prophet or one of the priests who pulled them to their feet. Some, however, were so far gone in their stupor that they could not be reawakened to consciousness so easily, and were carried off to the adjoining rooms.

In one case the prophet noticed a chain of beads round the “witch's” neck. He considered this to be the last stronghold of the witch-spirit and therefore had it cut off and “neutralized” with holy sand.

The exorcising activity of the sects is making a deep impression on many people and a good example of this is the following letter from a pupil teacher describing an exorcism performed by a certain church: “… I should be pleased to have you here to witness part of their annual celebrations. People came from parts of Ghana with their uncountable bags of food. Rain delayed them in many ways and they went to prayer at 10 p.m. in the night. They closed at about 12 p.m. About 12 o'clock in the night I heard them shouting and singing. I went there. I saw three women kneeling down and their faces to East. Their priest was holding a stick like Moses. He went round and round and doing signs on the women. Sometimes kicking them with the stick. One of them fell down. She was clawing on the ground. This was much to my looking. At first, the priest asked them to bring light near. There we saw a caterpillar and he told us that it was one of the bad spirits. After prayers, the women were led to their houses. Oh! My dear Minister, I wish if you were there. I cannot explain all. Please, do you believe this? Why? One of them told me that Jesus did the same. Please kindly explain how this can happen in a church”.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual68,Exorcism of Witch Spirits,"Healing the Witches

What happens if a witch has been “caught” by a shrine and has “confessed”? At one time witches were killed, but this has been stopped by the Government, and now the shrines attempt to heal witches or to drive away their witch-spirit.

A priest told me: “I cure the witches by water treatment. First an egg is broken over the head of the witch after her confession, then she is thrice sprinkled with medicated water. The recipe of this medicine is my secret”.

This is how Mr. Akesson describes the exorcism of witch spirits before the Kune shrine, in his manuscript “Gold Coast Fetishism Explained”: “After a victim's confessions have been heard and his sacrifice of a fowl has been accepted by the fetish, a day is fixed for the final exorcism. The linguist mixes red clay with water and brings with it an old sweeping broom. The victim sits in front of the male fetish. The linguist dips the broom into the liquid and gently strikes the top of the victim's head three times saying: ‘Yeyi wo bayie’ (we drive out your witchspirit). In the same manner, the face and the joints of the victim are struck thrice daily. After this the victim is asked to stand facing his house or town. The linguist then holds the neck and pushes him to give him a start to run away to his house without looking behind. As he runs away, the spectators hoot at him at the top of their voices until the victim has disappeared. This done, the patches of hair on his head are cut off for him by one of the fetish servants”.

A full confession must always precede the healing. The methods of the shrines for the curing of incipient witches and the driving away of witchspirits, are basically the same as those applied by herbalists specializing in the combating of witchcraft, who are frequently invoked by people believing themselves to be forced against their will into becoming witches.

This neurotic state of fear is much more difficult to cure than the full blown witch state, and in severe cases can even produce hysteric blindness and lameness. One herbalist said: “you become sick and shrink”. His treatment consisted of giving his patient some medicine to put into a bucket of water. At midnight he had to proceed in utter darkness to the town rubbish heap, and bath in the water. This had to be done on seven consecutive nights, the climax of the treatment coming when the anti-witchcraft doctor tore off the person's cloth and burned it, all tendency towards witchcraft in the patient thus being destroyed. A new cloth was then given to him, and two fowls were sacrificed and shared by patient and anti-witchcraft doctor in a hearty meal of rejoicing. The fee for this treatment he said to be seven pounds, seven shillings and seven pence.

The witches only punishment nowadays consists of fines, and public exposure to mockery and ridicule. Witches caught by some shrines are shamed by being made to dance in public.

It is said that witchcraft carries no stigma, and although members of the clan may press the victim to confess, in general a victim nowadays is kindly treated after confession and not maltreated for practising witchcraft. From my research however, I get the impression that while this may be true in some cases, witchcraft on the whole carries with it a social stigma. A witch who has been found out may not be maltreated, but he or she is certainly despised and ostracised, which is a much more severe punishment than the imposition of fines. When witches have been “cured” by a shrine, the protection of the shrine does not provide them with an enhanced social status, although anybody worrying them might “get into trouble with the shrine”.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual69,Apo festival,"Festivals

Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo[unavailable] festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo[unavailable] songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo[unavailable] dance for the festival.

The functions of the Apo[unavailable] festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically chek those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.

The most important festival dealing with “the propitiation, solicitation, or worship of ancestral spirits is the Adae” (Rattray, 1923:92). Adae means “place for rest” or “lying down”; no work is done on these days when the living recall the deeds of the deceased and solicit them for mercy and favours. The blood of sacrificed sheep is smeared by hand on the ancestral stools (human blood is never spilled on shrines); a libation is poured on each stool. The offering, excluding the omentum, is removed in the evening by the stool-carriers. Everyone entering the stool room removes his shoes, and bares his shoulders as a sign of humbleness before the superior spirits.

Many ceremonies such as this Adae follow a forty-two day cycle. The details vary from area to area; the Brong propitiate both the Samanfo and the bosom at the Adae while the Ashanti only propitiate the Samanfo. The day proceding any Adae is called dapaa, “good/lucky day”; this is a day of preparation and work, everything being scrubbed.

An annual custom is always held in connection with the first fruits of each staple crop such as yam. The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool. The spirits are invoked to start the new year and make it a good one, the new year beginning at different times in different localities.

The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”. (It is sometimes also called apafram). It is similar to the Apo[unavailable] in that all disputes are settled, bringing harmony back to the town. The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines. It is a festival involving remembrance of the dead, harvest, and thanksgiving.",1,0,0,0,7777,1
Ritual69,Apo festival,"Festivals

The only state religious affairs which are public are two annual festivals, the Apo[unavailable] Festival, which usually occurs in March, and the Yam Festival which falls sometime in October. In addition to these, there is a periodic, minor festival celebrated every forty-second day, a day called Monokuo.

The Techiman Apo[unavailable] Festival, an annual eleven-day celebration, originated at Manso, the ancient capital of the Bono Kingdom. This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority—especially the [unavailable]manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.

The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming.

The [unavailable]manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent [unavailable]manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State ([unavailable]man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State.

Finally, the Apo[unavailable] is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo[unavailable] Festival.

The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( [unavailable]henerεk[unavailable] dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul ([unavailable]saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance.

Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).

The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the [unavailable]manhene that he is about to eat yam and the [unavailable]manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The [unavailable]manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the [unavailable]manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.

Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the [unavailable]manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ank[unavailable]beahene, and the Barimhene. The [unavailable]manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.

Although the Yam and Apo[unavailable] festivals are annual, the Bono celebrate the Monokuo ceremony every forty-two days, on the Wednesday called Monokuo. During the Monokuo, early in the morning, the [unavailable]manhene pours a libation on his ancestral stools. After that, the elders come to join him and they all go to the palace for the Taa Mεnsah shrine to say good morning to him. At the last Monokuo for the year, the [unavailable]manhene pours a libation on the god. Otherwise, they only go to greet the god and then return to their houses. In the afternoon, each of the elders returns to Taa Mεnsah's palace with schnapps or pots of palmwine. The drinks are used to pour libations for each of the chiefs, after which they drink together, drums are beaten, and they dance.",1,0,0,0,1,0

Although the Yam and Apo[unavailable] festivals are annual, the Bono celebrate the Monokuo ceremony every forty-two days, on the Wednesday called Monokuo. During the Monokuo, early in the morning, the [unavailable]manhene pours a libation on his ancestral stools. After that, the elders come to join him and they all go to the palace for the Taa Mεnsah shrine to say good morning to him. At the last Monokuo for the year, the [unavailable]manhene pours a libation on the god. Otherwise, they only go to greet the god and then return to their houses. In the afternoon, each of the elders returns to Taa Mεnsah's palace with schnapps or pots of palmwine. The drinks are used to pour libations for each of the chiefs, after which they drink together, drums are beaten, and they dance.",1,0,0,0,1,0

Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo[unavailable] festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo[unavailable] songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo[unavailable] dance for the festival.

The functions of the Apo[unavailable] festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically chek those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.

The most important festival dealing with “the propitiation, solicitation, or worship of ancestral spirits is the Adae” (Rattray, 1923:92). Adae means “place for rest” or “lying down”; no work is done on these days when the living recall the deeds of the deceased and solicit them for mercy and favours. The blood of sacrificed sheep is smeared by hand on the ancestral stools (human blood is never spilled on shrines); a libation is poured on each stool. The offering, excluding the omentum, is removed in the evening by the stool-carriers. Everyone entering the stool room removes his shoes, and bares his shoulders as a sign of humbleness before the superior spirits.

Many ceremonies such as this Adae follow a forty-two day cycle. The details vary from area to area; the Brong propitiate both the Samanfo and the bosom at the Adae while the Ashanti only propitiate the Samanfo. The day proceding any Adae is called dapaa, “good/lucky day”; this is a day of preparation and work, everything being scrubbed.

An annual custom is always held in connection with the first fruits of each staple crop such as yam. The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool. The spirits are invoked to start the new year and make it a good one, the new year beginning at different times in different localities.

The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”. (It is sometimes also called apafram). It is similar to the Apo[unavailable] in that all disputes are settled, bringing harmony back to the town. The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines. It is a festival involving remembrance of the dead, harvest, and thanksgiving.",1,0,0,0,7777,1

The only state religious affairs which are public are two annual festivals, the Apo[unavailable] Festival, which usually occurs in March, and the Yam Festival which falls sometime in October. In addition to these, there is a periodic, minor festival celebrated every forty-second day, a day called Monokuo.

The Techiman Apo[unavailable] Festival, an annual eleven-day celebration, originated at Manso, the ancient capital of the Bono Kingdom. This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority—especially the [unavailable]manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.

The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming.

The [unavailable]manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent [unavailable]manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State ([unavailable]man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State.

Finally, the Apo[unavailable] is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo[unavailable] Festival.

The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( [unavailable]henerεk[unavailable] dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul ([unavailable]saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance.

Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).

The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the [unavailable]manhene that he is about to eat yam and the [unavailable]manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The [unavailable]manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the [unavailable]manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.

Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the [unavailable]manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ank[unavailable]beahene, and the Barimhene. The [unavailable]manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.

Although the Yam and Apo[unavailable] festivals are annual, the Bono celebrate the Monokuo ceremony every forty-two days, on the Wednesday called Monokuo. During the Monokuo, early in the morning, the [unavailable]manhene pours a libation on his ancestral stools. After that, the elders come to join him and they all go to the palace for the Taa Mεnsah shrine to say good morning to him. At the last Monokuo for the year, the [unavailable]manhene pours a libation on the god. Otherwise, they only go to greet the god and then return to their houses.

The white magician then goes out into Lake Titicaca in a b[unavailable]sa and collects basins of water, frogs, and water plants from certain deep pools where he deposits offerings. He is accompanied by men in other balsas with panpipes and drums. After returning to shore, the magician, the orchestra, and the spectators climb the mountain named Atoja, and proceed to the shrine called Father Atoja (pl. 111, top, left ) to deposit the water, plants, and frogs in the two basins of the altar which are exposed to the sun. The magician places offerings in the “mouth” of the altar, asking the mountain spirit to send rain. Everyone sings the frog song accompanied by panpipes, and drinks and chews coca.

Ritual74,Coqela Ritual,"The [unknown]coqela ceremony is performed regularly by the Peruvian Aymara in Ichu, Chucuito, and Juli and is also held, according to Bandelier, in western Bolivia (Bandelier, 1910, p. 103). Although representing the ritual hunting of the vicuña, it takes place after the harvest and is designed to produce large crops the following year. It is performed on hilltops. The group of performers consists of a chorus of women who do a posture dance and sing, carrying poles connected by woolen cords representing the vicuña fence (see Hunting, p. 519), an orchestra of men with special end-flutes and drums, a group of masked clowns led by a white magician ( paqo ), and a man who dances with a stuffed vicuña skin (pl. 112, top ). A song describing the ritual hunting of the vicuña must be rendered letter perfect, while the masked clowns pantomine the hunt (pl. 112, bottom ). These clowns wear fur inasks and caps and hairloom ponchos decorated with tufts of fur and carry slings and miniature bolas. They mock the bystanders and occasionally are obscene. They may not talk during the performance, but must communicate by grunts. These clowns, said by some to represent spirits, are called a[unknown]ca[unknown]cila , the generic word for supernatural beings. The man who dances with the stuffed vicuña imitates the antics of this animal. The rite culminates when the paqo sacrifices the vicuña and produces blood, meat, and intestines by sleight-of-hand.

Often it takes place in fixed spots where miniature stone houses are built and repaired each year. The houses are filled with miniature clay animals, utensils, implements, and articles of clothing in order that the owner may acquire all of these things during the following year. A mock market is held during which the objects are bought and sold with potsherds. They are later given to the children for toys. In parts of Bolivia, images of the fertility spirit ( eq'eq'o ) are kept in the houses. The fiesta is accompanied by considerable sexual license among the younger Aymara.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual76,Wilanca (House Dedication Rite),"House Dedication Rite , wilan[unknown]ca , “ Blood Sacrifice ”

That magical rites associated with the construction of houses were important in Inca times is made clear by the writings of Father Arriaga. Today both the Quechua and the Aymara hold dedicatory ceremonies, usually when the house foundations are excavated and not infrequently again when the structure is ready to be roofed.

Although in Chucuito the magician is at times summoned to make the foundstion sacrifice, this is usually a simple offering customarily made by the house owner or master builder, without professional assistance. By far the more important ceremony, however, is that held after the completion of house walls and before the roofing begins. Such a rite is considered vitally necessary to insure the happiness and general welfare of those who are to occupy the house. The dedication ceremony of any dwelling requires the services of a professional magician.

When the house walls have been finished, the remaining days preceding the dedicatory ceremony are devoted to assembling the necessary roofing inaterials--poles, thongs, thatch, and grass rope--as well as offerings for the rite and food, drink, and coca for feasting the participants. The relatives and friends of the house owner, as well as those individuals who owe him aini indebtedness, assemble the evening preceding the day on which the ceremony is to take place, for the blood sacrifice must be performed at dawn.

The house dedication ceremony observed by the writer occurred on December 17, 1941. The unfinished dwelling, the walls of which had been completed five days earlier, was situated on the outskirts of upper Chucuito on a rocky promontory overlooking Lake Titicaca. The place spirit of this site is known as San Sebastián tupu qawana . Anselmo Corrasco, the son of a financially prosperous Aymara family, owned the property, and the ceremony as observed appears to be exceptional only in that his father, Informant 85, officiated as magician.

The participants in this rite included the following individuals:

Anselmo Corrasco: Owner of the house
Manuel Corrasco (85): Magician; Anselmo's father
Fecundo nina: Magician's assistant; Anseimo's
brother-in-law
Mauricio toqe: Apprentice to magician
Moises Ramos: Anselmo's brother-in-law
Benita Teves: Anselmo's mother
Juana nina: Anselmo's wife
Manuel Corrasco II: Anselmo's brother
Senon Corrasco: Anselmo's brother
Casimiro Merma: Anselmo's maternal uncle by
marriage
Sabino Navincha: Anselmo's wife's young nephew
Bertram Flores: Master builder who built house
Ascensio tiki: Working for aini
Silverio Sosa: Working for aini
Eusebio Suero: Working for aini
Raimundo Meneses: Friend of Anselmo's father
Juan de Dios aski: Friend of Anselmo's father
Olomino marasa: Boy working for wages
Mariano Aguilár: Boy working for wages

(5:20 a.m. ): All has been prepared for the ceremony and the subsequent roofing bee, and 16 men (including three boys) and the two women are present. They stand around outside the house, talking, and occasionally stamping their feet in the pre-dawn cold. When we arrive, the magician says:

We are preparing this blood sacrifice to this sainted place so that no disease will attack those who will live here, and so that they will live very well.

(5:30 a.m. ): A brown and white spotted llama is tethered by a rope to a peg outside the house; Moises unties it and leads it into the room where the sacrifice is to take place. Inside a red carrying cloth with coca between its folds is spread out facing east (Pl. 28a). On the magician and his assistants arrange the following items (see Fig. 9):

1. [unknown]uwa
2. Flowers
3. Small pottery bowl
4. Incense burner
5. Flowers
6. Small pottery bowl
7. Wine
8. Alcohol and shot glass
9. Two enamel basins
10. New pottery basin
11. Two scallop shells
12. Incense ( kopala )
13. Sugar and candies
14. Mint ( [unknown]oa )
15. Llama fat
16. Incense ( insensio )

(5:40 a.m. ): When the paraphernalia and offerings have been arranged, the other men and women file in and stand against the house wall, facing east. The magician kneels before the ground cloth, mixes the [unknown]c[unknown]uwa , and grinds a bit of both kinds of incense together with sugar. Mauricìo shakes up the [unknown]c[unknown]uwa , spilling a little, and the magician tells him to be careful. Moises stands by silently, holding the llama's tether.

All kneel, excepting Moises and the magician, and the latter intones:

May everything be well. May God, the Sun, receive us very well. Now let us all kneel and kiss the sacred earth.

The magician leans over with his palms to the ground and kisses the earth; all, save Moises, do likewise. The magician pokes the coals in the incense burner, discovers that they are almost cold, and sends Sabino for live coals from the fire outside. When he returns carrying glowing coals on a rock slab, the magician dumps them into the brazier, sprinkles on incense, and offers it to the east, the southeast, and the northeast. Then, half turning, he offers it with a sweeping gesture to the western mountains, saying:

May all the powerful spirits of the mountains receive us well--this place spirit, San Sebastián tupu qawana , Illimani spirit, Asogini spirit, Autuja spirit, Atoja spirit, Mother and Father, and all the places.

The magician rises, goes outside the house, and offers incense to the roof beams, the thatch, and to all the roofing materials, uttering brief phrases of dedication to these objects. He returns to the house, Mauricio pours [unknown]c[unknown]uwa into one shell while Fecundo fills the other with wine. Then he kneels and throws a libation on the southeast side of the house door (inside), saying:

Illimani spirit, p[unknown]a p[unknown]a .

The assistants refill the shells again, and he pours wine over the llama's throat and [unknown]c[unknown]uwa over its back. Leaving the house again he offers libations to the roofing materials.

The magician calls his assistants outside and says:

On this spot we will burn the mesa .

They nod agreement, and the magician kneels, pours a libation on the spot, and kisses the ground; each assistant does likewise. Calling to Olomino to prepare a crater of dry manure on the selected spot, they return to the house to proceed with the ceremony.

Inside the house the magician says:

Now we will kill the llama. Who knows well how to cut its throat, to perform the blood sacrifice? Tie its feet with rope and then throw it to the ground so that it looks to the sunrise.

(5:55 a.m. ): At this point, Bertram, the “master builder” who supervised the construction of the house, arrives and offers to perform the blood sacrifice. He, Ascensio, Raimundo, and the magician then tie the llama, while Moises holds its ears. The llama is thrown and bound in a kneeling position facing east. While Ascensio and Raimundo hold down its haunches, Bertram accepts a long, sharp knife from Benita and then, twisting the animal's head backward, cuts its throat (Pl. 28b). A jet of blood spurts due east and the magician gravely nods his head at this favorable omen. He collects blood in the pottery basin and splashes it over the northeast and southeast side of the doorway (inside), and then over the other walls in no special order. Each assistant takes a pottery bowl, collects the fresh blood, and throws it about the house while the other men gather blood in other containers. All dash about, splashing blood over the gables, the outside walls, and the piles of roofing material.

As the dead llama is rolled over on its back, the magician sprinkles its chest with flower petals, saying:

Let us cut out the heart to burn for the place spirit.

With the knife Raimundo makes an incision down the llama's breast from the base of the neck to the bottom of the rib case while Ascensio, Casimiro, and Mauricio hold the carcass (Pl. 29a). Then Raimundo thrusts his hand into the chest cavity and tears out the heart. The magician meanwhile, without further ceremony, dumps the coca, flowers, and other offerings into a carrying cloth and, taking the still quivering heart, places it on top.

(6:15 a.m. ): While the llama was being sacrificed, the assistants set fire to the crater of dry manure, and by the time the magician appears with the offerings, the fire is burning brightly. He and the assistants kneel by the fire, facing east, and the magician throws coca, [unknown]oa , and lam[unknown]u upon the blaze. As he burns the offerings, Manuel says in an aside to Juan de Dios and Silverio, who are watching the proceedings and who are themselves well-known magicians:

I offer the mesa in a different manner. Is it a good way, or not, tata Juan de Dios? You are a good paqo . What do you say?

Juan de Dios answers:

You do as you like. I am not able to go over your head. You are an older man, tata Manuel. Do as you think best.

As the magicïans converse, Fecundo wraps the heart and more coca, [unknown]oa , and lam[unknown]u in a paper and hands the package to Manuel, who deposits it with flowers in the depression of the burning crater (Pl. 29b).

(6:30 a.m. ): The magician and assistants then return to the house, where Manuel announces:

It is finished. The fire has now burned. Now let us all chew coca.

Benita empties a supply of coca into the carrying cloth and all help themselves. Even the boys are given a leaf or two; Mariano grimaces and spits out his coca when unobserved. The magician then takes a bottle of alcohol and a shot glass, makes a libation first to the east and next to the dead llama, and then hands a drink to Bertram. The latter pours a few drops on the floor and drinks the rest while Manuel proceeds around the room, giving a drink to everyone, including the children.

(6:40 a.m. ): Following the interlude of drinking and coca chewing, Bertram, Ascensio, and Raimundo proceed to skin and dismember the llama. The meat, to be eaten later at the feast, is taken out and hung in strips over the roof beams. As a joke, Bertram gives the bladder to Sabino to make into a ball, and all laugh, although the boy seems pleased. When the internal organs have been removed from the rib case, Fecundo collects the remaining pool of blood in bowls and buries it in the four corners of the room. The knife, the basins, and bowls are washed, and the bloody water is poured into a jug in which all participants wash the blood from their hands. As the magician pours the bloody water over the floor, several of the men climb up on top of the house walls, and the roofing bee begins (6:50 a.m. ). The ashes of the sacrificial fire are now cool; they are carefully collected by the magician and his assistants and thrown into the near-by stream of murinlaya . This rite terminates the ceremony.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual77,Mesa Loqaña (Generaly Propitiatory Rite),"Generaly Propitiatory Rite, Mesa Loqaña, ""To Offer a Mesa""

Although the antiquity of this ceremony in its present form is uncertain, it seems quite clear that the great majority of the offerings as well as the component paraphernalia and procedures of the rite are in large part aboriginal. Of all the ceremonies today performed by practitioners of magic in Chucuito, the mesa loqaña is unquestionably employed most frequently and in the greatest number of situations.

The rite is extremely generalized and is performed to propitiate both spirits and demons. With respect to its manifest objective, a mesa may be offered in such diverse contexts as the curing of disease, the prevention of death and destruction from lightning, and the promotion of good will among relatives. It may prevent sorcery or theft, insure an abundant harvest and the fertility of livestock, or guarantee success in fishing. With minor differences in detail, it is performed by magicians for good and by sorcerers for evil. Although most frequently the mesa loqaña is a discrete rite, it is at times incorporated into such other ceremonials as the animal increase, the First Fruit, and the Compadre rites. Most frequently a mesa is offered at night and in the house of the client. On some occasions, however, as when offerings are made to cairns and sacrifices are made at the abodes of demons, the mesa loqaña rite is performed outside and during the day.

The following account describes a representative ceremony of this type as it was observed in Chucuito. The circumstances surrounding its performance on this particular occasion, however, were somewhat special and deserve brief preliminary consideration. For some months earlier the writer's wife, an archaeologist, had been engaged in the excavation of a ruined structure in Chucuito known as inka uyu . She employed a number of local Aymara as workmen, among them the Magicìans 45 and 66. Although they did not appear to be actively frightened, most of the Indians were somewhat apprehensive, not only about handling artifacts associated with their long dead and departed ancestors, but also about disturbing the abode of so powerful a place spirit as the inka uyu a[unknown]ca[unknown]cila . It was agreed at the outset, therefore, that upon the completion of the excavations, a propitiatory rite would be held (financed by the writer) in order to placate this spirit and to insure the welfare and health of all the workmen.

Additional complications, however, soon developed. Although according to Peruvian law all archaeological sites are the property of the state, the field in which inka uyu was situated had for some years been farmed by a Señora X, a local Mestiza. Señora X granted permission to excavate with the greatest reiuctance and only after pressure had been applied by Peruvian Government officials. In spite of the fact that she had been duly (and extravagantly) indemnified for any damage to her potato crop, Señora X became the butt of jokes of her Indian tenant farmers, who disliked her thoroughly and reveled in her predicament. Humiliated at this loss of face and generally frustrated by the whole proposition, Señora X quietly engaged a sorcerer and had all of the workmen, as well as the writer and his wife, bewitched. 1 Rumor of this malevolent act began to circulate simultaneously with the completion of the inka uyu excavations; the workmen were, of course, terrified. It was then decided that in addition to placating the place spirit of the ruin, the mesa loqaña ceremony should also be designed to counteract and nullify the sorcery. 2 For this purpose the two magicians who participated in the inka uyu excavations were engaged and they performed the mesa loqaña jointly, assisted by their apprentices.

The ceremony was held on March 31, 1942, in the house of Informant 66, the senior magician. Those present at one time or another (in addition to the writer, his wife, and the interpreter) included:

Silverio Sosa (66): Magician
Manuel Barrientos (45): Magician
Martín [unknown]coqe: Apprentice to Silverio
Antonio Perez: Apprentice to Manuel
Ascensia Alejo: Silverio's wife
Lorenza Sosa: Silvério's daughter (aged 12)
Manuel Sosa: Silverio's adopted son (aged 3)

(2:15 p.m. ): Silverio and Martín spread a blanket on the floor and over this a large brown carrying cloth. Silverio takes a brazier from a wail niche and hands it to Martín, who goes out to the kitchen and fills it with live coals. When he returns, all sit down around the carrying cloth, squatting on their heels. Because of the narrowness of the room the two magicians sit on the south side, facing north, while Martín sits to the west, facing east. Antonio has not yet arrived and no one else is present. Silverio opens a bundle wrapped in a red cloth and directs the placing of the various objects contained within (Pl. 27b). These, which are arranged on the ground cloth as shown in Fig. 10, include the following items:

1. Wine
2. Incense
3. [unknown]c[unknown]uwa
4. Alcohol
5. [unknown]oa
6. Knife
7. Large conch shell
8. Knife
9. lam[unknown]u
10. Scallop shell
11. Brass bell
12. Brass bell
13. Scallop shell
14. Plate containing a miscellaneous collection of small stone amulets, old coins, religious medals, and an old rosary
15. Small wooden crucifixes
16. Large standing crucifix

(2:25 p.m. ): Silverio takes the brazier and waves it about vaguely, muttering: Let us start.

He pauses, and then continues: May no sadness or misfortune follow us, golden street, silver street, sacred earth, inka uyu spirit.

He sprinkles more incense on the coals and passes the brazier to Manuel, who recites:

My father with medicines, I salute you, father, inka uyu spirit, inka pukara spirit, and all of the powerful mountains, golden table, silver table, golden chair, silver chair. Now may we all be well; may no disease attack the workmen. May this caballero be well [he nods to me], and also his wife.

Silverio adds more incense and passes the brazier to Martín, who continues:

Father above, creator of all things, master of all things, watch over your children, inka uyu spirit. Do not send us any misfortune.

(2:35 p.m. ): The little Sosa boy wanders in and stands by watching, but no one appears to be disturbed by this. The two magicians go out, wash their hands, and return with a pottery bowl that is then filled with llama tallow from the supply on the ground cloth. Silverio hands it to Manuel, saying:

You make the mesa from this lam[unknown]u .

(2:40 p.m. ): Manuel says:

First let us chew a little coca and drink a little alcohol.

Manuel opens a red carrying cloth placed at his side and selects a few leaves and some lime, while Silverio takes a chew of coca from a supply stored in his hat. Martín opens his coca bag and also takes a few leaves. This is done ritually, deliberately, and in silence.

Manuel produces a bottle of alcohol from a bag beside him and places it between himself and Silverio; the latter places a bottle of wine at his right and of [unknown]c'uwa at his left. All take a drink of alcohol; Silverio pours out a few drops, saying:

Here is your drink, sacred earth, Virgin of Copacabana.

(2:45 p.m. ): Manuei begins to scrape the llama tallow with a knife, while Martín sits by silently, ready to help. Silverio says to him:

Grind this incense well, tata .

Martín grinds the incense while Silverie prepares the [unknown]c'uwa . As they work, Manuel asks:

Will there be one mesa or two?

and then continues (to me):

Caballero, I thank you. May you live well. May God and the spirits receive you very well.

(3:00 p.m. ): Silverio pours himself a drink, offers a libation, drinks the rest, and passes the bottle to Manuel and Martín. After they drink he offers me the bottle; I refuse. Manuel comments:

The caballero also should drink a little alcohol. If not, the great stones of the Inca will not receive him.

Silverio adds:

You should drink too, because you are offering this mesa to inka uyu . It is for your health, too, so that you will not get sick.

I drink and the interpreter does likewise. None is offered the child and I point this out. Silverio replies:

He is just a baby; he doesn't know what is happening.

(3:20 p.m. ): Manuel has finished modeling the two mesa, and smooths them with alcohol. Silverio unwraps a package of little lead figurines and begins to sort them out (see p. 246).

(3:30 p.m. ): Silverio again passes the alcohol, saying:

Let us drink more alcohol, tata, and chew more coca.

Each removes his coca quid from his mouth, and Manuel and Silverio place theirs on a red carrying cloth in the corner. Martín begins to throw his away and Silverio admonishes him:

We must put the quids together in a corner. It is not a good thing to throw them away. That is like a child who doesn't want to eat when his mother gives him food.

Martín continues to grind incense, using a scallop shell for a pestle, while Silverio sorts the figurines. Manuel cuts up gold and silver paper with scissors to make the “banners” (see p. 247).

(3:45 p.m. ): Manuel says:

I am nearly finished. Now let us put the gold leaf on the mesa .

He discovers that there is not enough gold and silver leaf and goes to his house to fetch more. Martín goes with him.

(4:00 p.m. ): Manuel and Martín return with the materials, and the former and Silverio then begin to cover the two blocks of llama fat with gold and silver leaf (see p. 252). Manuel passes the alcohol and all drink. Silverio says to the child who is asking for a drink:

Go away, boy, don't come any closer. If you drank alcohol you might go crazy. Later I will buy you some bread.

Each removes his coca quid as before. Manuel and Silverio produce coca bags from under their belts; Manuel waves his coca bag over the paraphernalia and kisses it and then all exchange coca bags ceremonially (see p. 257). Then all have another drink. Silverio chants:

Golden place, silver place, forgive us, inka uyu . Today we salute you. Now once more the great house (i.e., the ruin) of our grandfathers may be seen. From the rubbish we have dug it so that all, small and large, may see it.

(4:15 p.m. ): Silverio's wife has just returned with the livestock and comes into the house where the magicians are working. Martín says:

Let us give you a drink, mama .

She accepts it and thanks him. Then he gives her a handful of coca and she departs with the child.

(4:20 p.m. ): Manuel and Silverio now begin to arrange the figurines on top of the blocks of lamp'u, a painstaking task. Manuel says:

Let us arrange the things well; the sun, the moon, and everything should be straight and even [p. 246].

(4:40 p.m. ): When the arrangement of the figurines is completed, all drink and chew coca. Silverio takes down a bundle from a storage niche and extracts a set of broken panpipes. He gives them to Martín, saying:

Now we only lack the banners. Split up these panpipe canes to make the poles.

Manuel cuts more gold and silver paper for the banners; Silverio sticks them to the cane slivers with llama fat. Manuel directs Martín in the splitting of the slivers, and Silverio says:

There should be twelve, six of gold and six of silver.

(4:55 p.m. ): Manuel says:

I am almost finished. Now we should begin with the aita so that we can name all the powerful places.

The mesa are completed. They clear away the scraps on the end of the ground cloth to make room for the aita [see p. 252]. Silverio urges:

We must hurry. It is almost night.

At this point Antonio enters, and Manuel tells him that he is late. He continues:

This tata (Antonio) has finally come. Let us make the k'insu of six leaves [see p. 252].

(5:00 p.m. ): Silverio starts the drinks around again, spreads out a small carrying cloth, and dumps a large supply of coca onto it to be used in preparing the aita . All chew coca, and Antonio spreads out a blanket to sit on, removes his sandals, and begins to sort out perfect coca leaves. All stuck the leaves into little piles of six each.

(5:15 p.m. ): Antonio is sent out to buy fuel to be used in burning the offering. The others continue to sort perfect coca leaves and to prepare the aita, a time-consuming task which occupies them until after 8:00 p.m. After darkness has fallen, Lorenza assists them by holding a lighted candle over the ground cloth so that they can see to work.

(8:15 p.m. ): Manuel announces,

Now this side is almost finished.

Silverio inspects the aita and approves, although there are only 96 (arranged in 12 rows of 8) whereas ideally there should be 144. The remaining coca is scooped up by Martín and Antonio and placed in its original carrying cloth. Manuel then divides this surplus coca equally and each fills his bag. All chew and exchange bags ceremonially, and the alcohol is passed around again.

(8:25 p.m. ): All present beg one another's forgiveness. Then Silverio produces more scallop shells, fills two with wine and two with [unknown]c'uwa, and places a shellful of each beverage on either side of the ground cloth. Silverio now begins the ceremony by ringing each brass bell and then scraping two shells together, intoning:

Father above, receive this mesa . May all be well.

Manuel repeats these actions, chanting:

Ay, father with medicines, receive this, God, my father with medicines, inka uyu .

Silverio sprinkles powdered incense over the shells and the crucifix.

(8:30 p.m. ): The offering of the aita begins, and a piece of paper sprinkled with shaved lamp'u is spread out to receive the aita as they are dedicated (see p. 254). The two magicians alternate after the dedication of three successive aita, beginning with Manuel. The assistants sit by silently and sprinkle each aita, after it has been dedicated, with lamp'u and q'oa . In this operation, Antonio aids Manuel and Martín assists Silverio. The pace is leisurely; the voices of the magicians are solemn and subdued. The opening dedicatory phrases are long and rambling as compared with those spoken later in the evening. 2 Thus, Manuel begins:

Ay, inka uyu, may all Peru be well; may all the people be well; may all the workmen be well, God, superior to all. May this caballero be well; may no misfortune befall him.

Many of the earlier dedicatory speeches contain prayers that are obviously entirely irrelevant to the current situation. Prayers are included, for example, for such diverse people and things as:

The law courts of Peru (“May there be order in the
grand courts of Lima”)
The President of the Republic (“May he live well”)
The national treasury (“May it be full forever”)
The highways and railways (“May they stay in
good repair”)
The senators of Peru
The vecinos (Mestizos) of Chucuito
The banks
The mines
Commerce generally, etc.

It is impossible in most cases to identify the various mountains to whom aita were offered, since the names of these are often local and they appear on no maps.

(8:45 p.m. ): They pause for a moment during the dedication of the aita for a drink and a chew of coca. Again the coca bags are exchanged ceremonially, and Silverio produces a fresh bottle of alcohol from a leather trunk in the corner of the room. At 8:55 p.m. the offering of the aita is resumed. Both magicians show signs of weariness, and the dedicatory phrases become increasingly more brief and disjointed.

(9:25 p.m. ): Manuel yawns and says:

We are almost half through. Now let's have a drink.

They drink and exchange coca bags ceremonially. Before resuming the aita dedication, however, they again beg one another's forgiveness. The dedicatory rite is resumed at 9:30 p.m. Silverio is so tired that he half reclines and must concentrate hard in order to think of additional mountain spirits. Manuel prompts him frequently and at times interrupts and corrects him.

(9:50 p.m. ): They finish dedicating the aita, exchange coca bags ceremonially, and drink. I pass around cigarettes; each man blows the first puff of smoke to the east (see p. 250). Manuel and Silverio move the paper containing the aita and the offerings to the back of the ground cloth; Manuel complains that there should be 24 more aita . The assistants hasten to prepare these, using coca from their own coca bags, and the magicians begin at once to dedicate them.

(10:20 p.m. ): The dedication of these aita ends with more prayers for the welfare of all participants in the inka uyu excavations, and for the health and prosperity of their families. Silverio concludes:

Finally, may this mesa burn well so that nothing will befall us; may it all finish well.

Manuel sprinkles q'oa and lamp'u over the paper of aita and says to Silverio:

Let us make the two libations.

Each magician takes a shell of wine and a shell of [unknown]c'uwa, passes them over the offerings, throws the liquids to the east, and then scrapes the shells together in the direction of the western mountains. Then each rings the two bells, and Manuel wraps the offerings in old newspapers while Silverio inspects the coca leaves remaining on the ground cloth. Since most of the leaves are found to be green side up, he says that this is a favorable omen. All drink, exchange coca bags ceremonially, and beg one another's forgiveness.

(10:45 p.m. ): While Manuel refills the shells with wine and [unknown]c'uwa, Silverio extracts two llama foctuses from a sack. These are given to the assistants who wipe and wrap them with gold and silver paper (see p. 248). They are then placed on top of the large conch sell, resting with their necks crossed.

(11:05 p.m. ): All scraps of paper, coca, and other offerings are carefully collected into a paper to be sacrificed with the aita, for everything must be burned. All exchange coca bags ceremonially and drink. All four men are now quite intoxicated and unsteady on their feet. In a thick voice, Silverio announces,

Now it is nearly midnight. Get everything ready. Take the bundles. We must go to inka uyu .

Manuel prays:

May everything be all right, father above, golden mesa, silver mesa .

Taking the bundle of offerings, he holds it against the forehoads of all present in turn, in imitation of the familiar Catholic blessing. The offerings are then packed into saddle bags, and all four stagger out into the dark night, across the fields to the ruin. The only light is a flickering kerosene lantern carried by Martín.

(11:30 p.m. ): In the center of the ruin Martín and Antonio build a pyre for burning the offerings. First they spread a bed of dry grass; on top of this they construct a rectangular wall of dry cow ships. Antonio lights the fire; it flickers and smokes in the high wind from the Lake. In the distance a dog barks, and at these ill omens Silverio gestures in the air with a knife, telling the dog to stop barking and the wind to stop blowing.

(11:45 p.m. ): Manuel kneels facing east, throws incense into the fire, and passes the rest to Silverio, who also offers incense, saying:

Sacred earth, inka uyu spirit.

Each magician in turn offers incense three times. When the fire is burning well, Manuel calls out in a low voice:

Let us burn the aita, the mesa, and the llama foetuses.

Kneeling twice, Martín hands the bundle of aita to Manuel who takes it with a flourish and tosses it into the flames, saying:

Receive this, golden treasure, silver treasure, inka uyu spirit.

Sparks shower over the ruins as Antonio brings the llama foetuses and they too are thrown into the blaze. Martín fills shells with wine and [unknown]c'uwa, and Silverio throws one libation to the east and a second into the fire. The libations are repeated three times, and then Manuel does likewise, chanting:

Golden libation, silver libation, p'u p'u,

while Silverio throws three additional libations around the ruins. Following this the assistants offer six libations each. Meanwhile Silverio gestures in the air with his knife, muttering:

May no one know of this, may no one hear of it, inka uyu spirit.

Manuel tosses the mesa into the flames and, at his signal, all grab the lantern, the saddle bags, and the carrying cloths, and hurry away across the fields without looking behind them. By midnight the ceremony was completed.

At some time before dawn the magicians and assistants returned to the ruin from Silverio's house, where they had continued drinking and chewing coca, and obliterated all traces of the sacrifice, including all footprints left by the participants. The ashes were swept up and thrown into the stream of inkulaya . There a final prayer for the welfare of the workmen concluded the mesa loqaña ceremony.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual78,Uiwataki Mesa Loqaña (Animal Increase Rite),"Animal Increase Rite, uiwataki mesa loqaña, “ To Offer a mesa for the Animals ”

Animal increase rites, in one form or another, are practiced widely by the contemporary Aymara of both Peru and Bolivia. In Chucuito proper such ceremonies are rarely held because stock breeding is not of primary importance in the economy of the village. In some of the outlying ayllus, however, the raising of livestock is of considerable economic importance; in these areas animal increase rites are performed frequently.

The occasions on which these ceremonies are held in the pastoral ayllus of Chucuito are variable. Rites to increase the flocks of sheep may be performed on San Juan's Day (June 24); for cattle during the fiesta of Trinidad (May); and for liamas and alpacas at the time of the fiesta of San Andrés (December). Increase rites designed to promote the fertility of ail livestock may be held on Christmas Day. Increase ceremonies are also performed in the mating season of llamas and alpacas (July), at branding (during Carnival, in February or March), and at shearing time (December). In addition, animal increase rites may be held whenever a stockbreeder feels that his flocks are, or have been, threatened.

With minor variations, the above-mentioned increase ceremonies are extremely similar, irrespective of the class of animal for which they are held. Since they are often coupled with such activities as branding or shearing, these ceremonies are frequently performed during the day. If no house is available, as often happens in the grazing areas distant from the Lake, the ceremony is held and the sacrifice offered in a corral. Increase rites are normally attended by the owner of the livestock, his immediate family, and by those individuals (friends or relatives) who have come to assist him because of aini obligations.

Ordinarily feasting and social dancing follow an increase ceremony since these rites are considered occasions for celebration. The account of the increase ceremony that follows is based on a description by Informant 45 of a rite he performed for a client, Pablo mamani of k'arukaya ayllu in the Estancia country. This ceremony, held on August 2, 1941, was designed to promote the fertility of “all the livestock” (Pl. 30a,b).

The ceremony was performed at approximately 10:00 in the morning after the animals (llamas and sheep) had been rounded up and driven into the corral. Since the mamani household was situated near by, the magician elected to prepare the mesa inside. The ceremonial bundle, in this case wrapped in a carrying cloth and a short, jaguar skin poncho, contained the following items, arranged on the ground cloth as iliustrated in Fig. 11 and Pl. 30b:

1. mesa
2. Scallop shell
3. Three bone crucifixes
4. Scallop shell
5. Libation gourd
6. Libation gourd
7. Stuffed wildcat
8. Puma paw
9. Rope
10. Amulets
11. Puma paw
12. Stuffed wildcat
13. Wooden libation bowl
14. Bottle of [unknown]c'uwa
15. Coca bag
16. Bottle of wine
17. Wooden libation bowl

A thin llama-hair rope, arranged in a circle, represents the corral. The several animal amulets (see p. 239) are placed inside it facing east:

You do this so that the animals will always be there and won't go away.

Once the ceremonial layout has been arranged, the magician goes out into the corral among the animals and, kneeling, offers incense towards the east, chanting:

Now, spirits, well will I begin to prepare this mesa for the animals. Receive it so that there will be no misfortune. May all be well.

Then the magician returns to the house and offers incense to the amulets, repeating the prayer. Following this, all present, beginning with the owner of the livestock, offer incense to the east and to the amulets. All beg one another's forgiveness, drink, and chew coca.

The magician and his assistant then prepare the mesa (see p. 252), while the client and his guests dance in the corral to the accompaniment of panpipes and drum. When the offering has been completed, all drink, chew coca, and once more beg one another's forgiveness.

Returning to the corral, the magician offers libations of wine and [unknown]c'uwa first to the east and then to the sky. 1 All present repeat these acts. The magician reënters the house and, pouring out a shell of wine, dips a flower into it, sprinkling the liquid over the amulets. 2 He then pours out a shell of [unknown]c'uwa and offers this to half of the animal amulets. Returning to the corral, the magician again offers libations to the east and to the sky. All present in turn repeat his actions up to this point. Back in the house the magician offers [unknown]c'uwa to the rest of the animal amulets and then, with the wooden libation bowls, douses the amulets with chicha . All the spectators duplicate his actions. The wildcats are next offered libations, first of wine, then of [unknown]c'uwa , and finally, of chicha . All present do likewise.

For the third time the magician returns to the corral and offers libations of wine and [unknown]c'uwa to the east and to the sky. As before, all present repeat his actions. Finally, the magician again offers incense to the east and to the amulets, as in the beginning of the rite, as do all participants. All drink, chew coca, and beg one another's forgiveness.

Meanwhile, on the east side of the corral the assistant constructs a small, dome-shaped adobe and fieldstone oven with a small door open to the east. When this has been completed, it is filled with dry dung from the corral and lighted. When the fire is burning well, the magician throws in the mesa, coca, flowers, and all scraps incidental to the preparation of the offering. As these are consumed in the flames, he offers incense to the east, saying:

Spirits, now it is finished. Receive this mesa well so that there will be yet more animals.

When the oven has cooled, it is taken apart and the site where it stood is marked by a flat stone. The ashes are swept up, carried away, and thrown into near-by Macuamayo River.

Lesser increase rites are performed by laymen themselves for the benefit of their livestock. Thus most herders keep animal amulets in their houses and regularly feed them llama fat, coca, and flower petals.

If you have one of these, your llamas will not die and you will have lots of them (54).

On the eve of San Juan's day (June 24) grass fires are lighted in the hills and in the corrals “to warm the animals.” Miniature animals are also modeled of quinoa dough, k'ispiña, on this day and placed in small bowls, representing corrals, formed of the same material. This practice is called uiwa laraña, “animal making.”

If you do this, you will always have many sheep (9).",0,0,0,0,1,1

Ritual80,First Fruit Ritual,"First Fruit Rite, manq'ataki loqaña p'awaqa, “ to make an offering to the food ”

Writing soon after the Conquest, Cieza de León described the potato harvest rite as one of the most important Aymara ceremonies. 6 At present, although agricultural ceremonialism appears to be far more highly elaborated among the Bolivian Aymara than in Peru, rites on the occasion of the potato harvest continue to be performed in Chucuito.

During the fiesta of Espíritu in May, at the time of the harvest of late potatoes, the magician may be called upon to perform a ceremony for the most perfect vegetables. Such rites are held for individuals, for extended families, or, occasionally, for several closely related extended families; they are said not, however, to be held for larger social units. During the harvest season the largest and most perfect specimens of vegetables and grains (potatoes, ocas, isaño, uluku, habas, wheat, barley, quinoa, etc.) are selected and set aside for the ceremony. According to the kind of vegetable, these specially selected examples are designated [unknown]c'oqe t'inka, “libation potato,” or apil t'inka, “libation oca.” The client must save at least one vegetable from each of his fields, and these are carefully guarded inside the house.

The ceremony is held on the evening of Espíritu fiesta; the perfect vegetables are arrayed on a new carrying cloth in the place of honor in the house, opposite the doorway. After they have been smoked with incense they receive libations of wine and pisco and are sprinkled with k'intu of coca (see p. 252). Then, depending upon the amount the client wishes to spend, the magician offers a p'awaqa or a mesa . As stated above, informants were not always clear as to whether these offerings were intended for perfect vegetables, the place spirit, or for both. The client and all present then offer a k'intu of coca each, and the magician prays that food will always be abundant and that the supply will never become exhausted. While the paqo burns the offerings in the patio of the house, buries the ashes, and marks the spot with a flat stone, everyone present dances to the music of panpipes and drums, each carrying some of the perfect vegetables in a carrying cloth on his back.

It is as though the potatoes were dancing; they are making the fiesta for the potatoes (45).

The next morning, at sunrise, an animal (either a white sheep or llama) is sacrificed outside the doorway of the house (see p. 248). The blood of this sacrifice, called manq'a wilan[unknown]ca, “blood for the food,” is collected in sea shells, and libations of it are offered to the east, the house, and to the perfect vegetables. The llama is then cut open and the spleen, [unknown]c'akara, inspected to divine the future of the client.

If he is going to die, the spleen will look like a corpse. But if the spleen is flat and perfect, everything will be all right (45).

Following the blood sacrifice the llama is butchered, and a feast is held for those who participated in the ceremony. All of the meat, as well as the perfect vegetalbles and grain, must be consumed before nightfall.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual81,Divinatory Agricultural Rite,"A second rite, which does not necessarily require the services of a magician, is performed for the growing potatoes during Carnival. The owner of a field burns coca, llama fat, and q'oa in a ring of manure, open to the east, as an offering to the place spirit. Following this a perfect potato plant is uprooted and the potatoes counted off in two's to divine the outcome of the crop. An even number signifies an abundant harvest, while an odd number presages a poor crop. The plant is then replanted and sprinkled with wine, after which the owner and his friends feast and dance.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual82,Compadre Ritual,"Compadre rite , kompadre

Briefly, the term compadre (or comadre, depending on the sex of the person in question) designates an individual to whom one is bound by ties of “ceremonial kinship.” As employed in Chucuito, compadre and comadre are reciprocal terms that designate, respectively, the father and mother of one's godchild, ahijado. Compadre relationships are here initiated on three principal occasions: (1) at the baptism of an infant; (2) at a child's first haircutting; and (3) at marriage. Since each of a man's children may have different padrinos, or godparents, on each of these occasions, any individual may have a considerable number of compadre . In many ways the bonds of ceremonial kinship resemble ties of consanguinity or affinity, and individuals standing in such a relationship to one another are bound together by a series of formal obligations, as well as (in theory) by attitudes of mutual respect and affection.

Although it is quite clear that the Compadre ceremony as practiced in its present form cannot be of native origin, since the compadre complex itself is unquestionably of Spanish introduction, it has been adapted to Aymara ceremonial pattern, and is in effect a merging of the mesa loqaña rite with the séance. At the present time Compadre rites are celebrated by the Aymara of Bolivia as well as in Peru.

In Chucuito the Compadre ceremony is held on the eye of the second Thursday before Carnival, often designated Fueves de Compadre, while the Comadre rite is celebrated (when it is held at all) on the eve of the Thursday preceding Carnival, called Fueves de Comadre . The avowed purpose of the ceremonies is to reaffirm the cordial relations that should, in cultural theory, prevail between compadres:

They have this fiesta so that all will be good and nothing will be bad; so that they will have good animals and crops, and so that they will be on good terms with each other (2).

When a man decides to hold a Compadre ceremony, he announces his intentions and sends invitations to all of his compadres well in advance. These individuals, accompanied by their wives and children, arrive at the host's house on the Wednesday preceding the second Thursday before Carnival.

Usually the ceremony is good for 10 years, but some people have it every year. If the ceremony is very solemn, it lasts for more years (2).

On the occasion described by Juan kurasi (2), the rite was attended by his wife and children, by his younger brother and his wife and children, and by three of Juan's compadres with their wives and children. The last-mentioned children were Juan's ahijados de bautizo, since he had assumed the role of godparent when they were baptized. Juan's own children had Mestizo godparents; although they sent the conventional, appropriate gifts, they did not attend the ceremony.

At approximately 8:00 in the evening, Juan's relatives and compadres assembled in his house, where a magician prepared a mesa and a p'awaqa . As described by Informant 2, this rite conformed in all important particalars to the account of the mesa loqaña rite given above (see p. 269). During the preparation of the offerings and the dedication of the aita, all participants begged one another's forgiveness three times.

This is very important in Compadre because the whole reason for the fiesta is to make everyone friendly.

Following this, the magician blew out the candles and held a séance.

First they called the different spirits and the spirits talked to everyone and blessed everyone. They [the spirits] said, “Juan, may you be healthy.” They said, “Mariano, may you have good crops and many sheep.” There were many spirits and no one knew which spirit was talking.

After they received the blessings of the spirits, the assembled compadres summoned and conversed with the souls of deceased relatives and friends.

They talked to all the people they used to know, and it was as though they were alive again.

On three occasions during the séance everyone present again begged one another's forgiveness. When the séance terminated, the magician and his assistant burned the offerings in the courtyard of the house, buried the ashes, and marked the spot with a flat stone.

When another paqo comes the next time you have this ceremony, he has to dig up these ashes and throw them in a river.

On the following day, Fueves de Compadre, the various compadres returned and presented Juan with gifts:

One brought me a sheep, another a cheese, and the third some eggs.

In return Juan gave each of his godchildren a new outfit of clothing, a conventional gift on such occasions, known as [unknown]ceqa, “wings.” The remainder of the day was spent in feasting and friendly carousing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual83,Troka Ritual,"In the event of an epidemic, the magician, or at times the qolasiri , may be summoned to perform a rite called troka , designed both to cure the patient and to banish the disease. This rite is held for an individual, an extended family, or for several extended families. The patient is placed in bed with silver coins, food, and valuable clothing in order that the disease may impregnate and pass into these objects. The patient is also bathed carefully in a mixture of water and alcohol. The valuables and the bath water are then carried away to a deserted spot, wasara , to the junction of two streams, or to cross-roads, and there abandoned, occasionally with a p[unknown]awaqa or mesa , which in this instance is offered to the disease itself (33). In the event that a traveler finds these objects and carries them away, it is Aymara theory that he takes the disease with him. If no one is tempted by the troka , the disease may be unable to find its way back to the sick patient or may be persuaded by the offerings to go elsewhere. In the opinion of Informant 66, it is dangerous for a magician to perform a troka unless he is accompanied by his assistant or at least by another person who should dispose of the contaminated objects:

A paqo is good; to throw away the disease is a bad thing. That is why his assistant must do it. The disease is afraid to attack two people, but it will attack one.

It is clear from the following entry in Bertonio's dictionary that in essence the troka rite is an ancient Aymara ceremony. He states:

Tapitha: Dexar enel camino ropa o lana, eit., para q el q la hallar se lleue la enfermedad de aquella persona cuya era la ropa. Es supersticion de indios .

As explained earlier, soul loss is thought to be a cause of disease common both to adults and to children, although more prevalent among the latter. On the one hand sudden fright, shock, or accident may jolt the soul loose from the body and cause it to wander; on the other, the soul may be kidnapped or imprisoned by a demon because of natural malevolency, or at the instigation of a sorcerer. While the latter type is more serious and requires counter-sorcery, the former, which is especially common among children, may be cured by treatment. In the presence of the patient the magician offers incense to the place spirit and recites prayers, summoning the soul by name and urging it to return (66). Then he rings a little brass bell, calling out repeatedly to the soul and coaxing it back. Meanwhile the magician fumigates the patient in the smoke of two cactus plants, akila t'una and mari t'una . The rationale for this behavior is that while the soul is absent, the patient's body may be occupied by demons:

The smoke drives out the supaya in the person's body so that the soul ( anima ) can get back in (66).

Following this, incense is offered once more, the soul again called, and the patient is made to drink an infusion which has as its main ingredient the ground bones of a priest. For the Puno region, La Barre describes a somewhat different rite that also has as its objective the restoration of a wandering soul:

The doctor takes a little mannikin, gives it the name of the loco [i.e., the patient] and then performs magic so that the absent soul will return and come into the doll. Then the doll is put in bed with the sick person, and the soul is exorcized to return into the body it had left.

Before counter-sorcery is discussed, it is necessary to summarize very briefly the techniques of black magic employed in contemporary Chucuito. As stated above, sorcery is the profession of the laiqa . Since generally this specialist acts at the bidding of a client rather than out of self interest, in the opinion of most Aymara in Chucuito guilt devolves primarily upon the latter. The activities of the sorcerer are designed to kill his victim, to send disease or insanity, to cause accidents, or to destroy the victim's livestock and crops. To produce a spell, bodily exuviae or old clothing of the victim are required as well as (usually) a toad representing this individual. In order to produce similar effects on the victim, the toad is mutilated or strangled and then wrapped in a bundle, laiqa q[unknown]epe , with the exuviae. At other times, instead of using a toad, the sorcerer kidnaps the victim's soul and imprisons it in an old cow horn. The bundle, together with the dead toad or the cow horn, fox fat, and threads that have been twisted in reverse of normal, is then hidden in a ruin, or buried at the abode of a demon or on the victim's property. Almost invariably the bundle is interred with offerings to the demon or place spirit, and these, with minor differences in the preliminary details, are highly similar to those prepared by the magician for benevolent magic. Ordinarily they include coca, q[unknown]oa , llama fat, incense, q[unknown]olpa , and the like.

For sorcery to be effective, of course, the victim must be made aware of it. This is ordinarily accomplished through the medium of village gossip or rumor. The victim sickens; then he or his relatives endeavor to discover through divination whether or not sorcery has been practiced. A diviner, doctor, or magician can detect the presence of sorcery by reading coca, or a magician can consult supernaturals during a séance. In all events the victim is advised to find the bundle and burn it; the direction of the smoke will then indicate the whereabouts of the sorcerer or his malevolent client.

Until he knows the location of the bundle or the identity of the sorcerer or his client, the magician is powerless to act. Once, however, this information has been obtained, either by accidental discovery or through the revelations of supernaturals, the paqo may cope with the situation in several ways. The victim or his relatives may, of course, wish to hire another laiqa and retaliate with counter sorcery, but such an expedient is considered both dangerous and anti-social (11, 66).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual84,Linka Ritual (Link[unknown]a),"Rites and Worship

The ritual details of the many localized religious celebrations of the Aymara will better be dealt with in a later special section on fiestas and dances. A general statement here of their practices may, however, be in order. The many cults of local gods, celebrated at specified calendric periods, have in modern times degenerated into what could best be called “fiestas,” bearing a heavy burden of reinterpretation according to the calendar of feast-days of the Church. There is nothing remaining, unless it be the alasita fair, which bears any resemblance to an uncontaminated cult to a native god, this having disappeared centuries ago. This statement is true even though a goodly bulk of the content of the fiestas is indisputably native in origin. It is even probable that in Bolivia there is a larger admixture of the native than anywhere else in Latin America, certainly more than in the familiar examples afforded by Mexico or Peru.

But if there is not much left of a cult to the god of the local group, there is an endless petty round of family or individual rituals still surviving. Many of these are described elsewhere, under the sections on omens, amulets, agricultural, fishing, hunting, and house-magic, and also under medicine. There is in fact no sharp line between Aymara religion, magic, and medicine; what I shall describe under medicine is merely those cases in which a specialist does therapeutic magic for a client rather than the person performing the magic directly for himself. This latter is a thoroughly common practice in modern times.

Whenever an Aymara does anything of importance in his life he always precedes it with a propitiatory offering or sacrifice called link[unknown]a, [unknown]ca[unknown]a , or log[unknown]ta . On beginning any important agricultural activity, before fishing, or hunting, or building a house, making a journey, or even making a purchase, the Aymara performs this little ritual. Usually it consists in making a libation of a few drops of alcohol to the earth, offering a leaf of coca or two, or perhaps a tiny round Bolivian sweet such as one finds in native markets everywhere. It is much like the offering of eyelashes and coca at an a pa[unknown]ceta . Although sometimes made to pa[unknown]camama , or the earth, in many agricultural ceremonies, it is also commonly made to the a[unknown]ca[unknown]cila or ancestral spirit of a mountain peak, and the like. When alcohol is involved, as in the case of making a purchase, the participants to the bargain may drink some themselves from a tiny silver cup called tilinki , after having offered a libation to the spirits. In more pretentious and important sacrifices a favorite object is a su[unknown]u , the aborted fetus of a llama. Coca, of course, is ubiquitous in Aymara sacrificial offerings. Another favorite substance is fat of the jaguar or utur-uncu , or other animal fat, particularly from the puma or the llama. Guinea-pigs are a common animal sacrifice, and in the greatest of all the Aymara may even sacrifice one of his beloved llamas. Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamayhua says that in ancient times the Colla performed sacrifices of children in order to take omens in time of war.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The individual or couple chosen as godparent becomes compadre or co-parent to the parents of the child.

People seem to be successful in realizing the preferences they state. 81 percent of compadres are chosen from their own side of the dual division, and only 4 percent are chosen from out of town. percent of compadres are chosen from among nonrelatives. A significant factor in the choice of compadres is maintaining good neighbor relations. Most families surround themselves with a ring of compadres which neutralizes both the fear of being the object of witchcraft and of being accused of witchcraft. Factors of wealth, prestige, and status positions--particularly that of fiscal--are also taken into consideration in choosing a compadre. Most of the padrinos of baptism are chosen from among older members of the community, but on other occasions they are as likely to be chosen from among peers of the parents.

The occasions on which the first informant in Table 20 acquired compadres are spelled out in the following diagrams to show the growth of the network of compadrazgo relations in the course of a lifetime.

Compadres of C. K., sixty-five-year-old man . C. K. chose as compadres on the occasion of the baptism of his first child an older man who lived in the same section of town. The diagram shows the composition of the baptismal party. The darkened symbol in this and the following diagrams represents the child baptized.

C. K. addresses all of the guests by the term “compadre” and refers to the group as “kumparetak.” The second child has the same padrino, and the same group of relatives attended the ceremony. For the third child, C. K. chose a Ladino shopkeeper from the neighboring town. He chose him because, “I sold wheat to him, and I saw he was honorable.” C. K. had a house fiesta to which the shopkeeper came with his wife. This is somewhat unusual and occurred because the compadre was from another town. C. K. chose as the padrino of his fourth child another Ladino he knew in the same town, but the padrino did not attend the house fiesta to which only his sister, her husband, and her husband's brother came. A woman prayer-reciter of the same section was chosen as madrina of his fifth and sixth child when C. K. was fiscal. A younger man of the same section was chosen as the padrino of the seventh child. C. K. helped his son select the padrino of a grandson born in his house, a man from the same section. Attending this house fiesta was the group of relatives represented in the diagram.

The relatives assembled are essentially the same as those who attended the birth of C. K.'s first child. They are the core of the me[unknown]iltatil for his family, a core which expands to include additional compadres and neighbors for special house rituals. The second and third grandchildren had as padrino a man from the opposite section.

In summary, C. K. has chosen four Indian compadres and two Ladino compadres for the baptisms of his own children. Other members of the me[unknown]iltatil who became compadres on these occasions include five men and three women who are bilateral and affinal relatives.

C. K. has been asked to be padrino of baptism by four persons:

1. A neighbor asked him to be padrino of his child. At a small fiesta, he became compadre of the father and godfather of the child.

2. A man from the opposite section asked him to be padrino of his son's child, and he acquired the group of compadres shown in the diagram.

3. A man of the same section asked him to be padrino, and he acquired 6 compadres and 7 comadres.

4. A man of same section asked him to be padrino, and he acquired 5 compadres and 5 comadres.

In becoming a padrino of baptism and marriage, C. K. has acquired 33 compadres, 31 comadres, 4 godchildren of baptism, and 7 godchildren of marriage, 4 of which are his nephews. Adding to the 6 compadres of baptism for his own children, he has 39 compadres and 37 comadres, a total of 76. Most people by the time they have reached 60 have acquired well over 50 compadres.

The relationship between compadres is one of respect, and the referential and vocative terms, kumpare and kumare , or compadre and comadres in Spanish, take precedence over any other relationship term. The godchild is expected to bring a load of wood to his padrino's house when the latter has a household ceremonial, and when the godchild is old enough, he will serve as b'alnial, or assistant. All the people who attend the household ceremony following the church baptism become compadres and constitute the kumparetak. Compadres attend each other's household ceremonials, acting as nakawanehetik (attendants who are present at all household ceremonials) or b'alnialetik. Compadrazgo is patterned on a pre-Conquest institution establishing ties between attendants in household rituals called maliwanehetik.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual91,Baptism,"The church ceremony is followed by another ceremony in the house of the child's parents. As the group returning from the church enters the house, they are greeted with the pat[unknown]o[unknown]tan by the maliwanehetik who are waiting for them in the house. As they enter, each of the returning party says, “You go forward, kumpare.” They embrace all of the waiting party, an act which establishes their relationship as compadres with the entire company. When the padrinos leave, the grandparents and parents of the child go to a spot before the eaves outside the house; there the father of the child serves liquor to the padrinos and the grandparents of the child. The drink is called “the finale as the compadres leave.” The group must finish the entire liter “since it is a gift,” and if there are only one or two grandparents, they may get fairly drunk. As the compadres leave, the grandpaernts say, “Over the soil, over the mud where you take your holy godchild, your holy flower, your holy candle.” The child, referred to metaphorically as holy flower, holy candle, is identified with the most sacred symbols of the culture.

The emphasis on the group relationship in Tzo[unknown]ontahal contrasts with the form of compadrazgo found in the central plateau of Mexico where the dyadic tie between two compadres provides flexibility in achieving instrumental ends in political or economic life. 3 Some of the new leaders in economic enterprises are beginning to emphasize the dyadic contract in their compadrazgo relationships to achieve political support, but its greatest importance is still based on creating or reinforcing group solidarity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual92,Fiesta for the Patron Saint,"Fiesta for the Patron Saint

One of the major events in the religious life of the Indians is the annual fiesta in honor of the patron saint and the other saints kept in the church. The capitán principal and some of his immediate assistants are in charge of the organization and expenses of these fiestas. The length and cost of the fiesta correspond to the importance of the saint and range from one day and 100 pesos to four days and several thousand pesos, like the one for the patron saint. To become a capitán principal a man must go through all the ranks and be able to afford the expenses of any fiesta, from a small one to the very large ones of the patrons.

The fiesta of the patron of each village is similar to that for any other saint but larger. There are Masses and other religious observances in the church, processions with the image of the saint along the main streets, large meals at the house of the cargoholders, and, above all, constant drinking in and out of church. From the second day on, everybody is drunk including women and young people. The sound of skyrockets is heard continuously and marks the gaiety of the people.

An important part of the ceremony at the church is to clean carefully the face of the saint and to change his clothes for new or at least clean ones so that he can be happy during his fiesta. Another act is to take his image from the main altar to carry it in procession. This is important because there is danger that the patron of other villages may come to steal his power and he would then lose influence over the crops: the saint of Oxchuc helps the growth of corn, the one of Cancuc protects the cotton, and so on. To avoid this danger a substitute image is put in his place while the real one is taken out. This substitute is called gelol , the same image but smaller, which is kept next the original one.

During the procession the saint is carried in a litter. Incense is burned before him, while music with drums and flutes is played.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual93,Talking Saints,"Talking Saints

Another religious form where Indian tradition is manifested through Christian formulae is the veneration of the talking saints, a widespread cult among the Tzeltal and Tzotzil. These saints are always private property and are usually kept in a small case on the house altar. The believers go to the house of those who own a talking saint and ask him about any secret problem that might require a special knowledge to be solved. Although any saint can be asked, the most popular one is San Miguelito. In order to consult him, people have to tell his owner their problems. The owner, who supposedly is the only one who can understand his saint, talks to him behind a curtain so that no one can see him. Often the owner of a talking saint succeeds in creating a cult out of the saint's box, making a special altar for him and asking the believers for frequent offerings and prayers. Sometimes there is no box, so the effigy is placed on an altar and concealed by a curtain when the private dialogue takes place.

There have been cases, however, in which the talking saints exceed their function as oracles and advise people on political matters. This is why some talking saints have been taken away by the local authorities and sent to the Indians' Affairs Office in San Cristobal.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual94,Ceremonial Drinking,"Ceremonial Drinking

The full expression of a ceremonial drinking cycle has a number of performance correlates which permit its identification. While it is generally true that ceremonial drinking, in contrast to “informal” drinking, is specifically initiated as a part of one of the rituals just mentioned, its most crucial, i.e., unambiguous characteristic is a formal speech which a senior male of the sponsoring group makes to the receiving group. This speech is responded to with equal formality by a senior male of the receiving group. There are several examples in text of this particular interchange between the sponsor and the receiver. An example of one of these, as reported by Lorenzo Mendez, is given below.

This exchange initiates the ceremonial drinking sequence. (The sequence is composed of a series of acts ; a set of drinking sequences constitutes a drinking cycle .) Upon the termination of the speeches, the owner of the aguardiente asks a junior male to take a proffered liter bottle of aguardiente and a shot glass and offer a drink to each of the men present.

The server must initiate the act of drinking with every other male in the group. Whatever the quantity of aguardiente in the liter bottle, it must be equally distributed among all those present including himself. The drink server must estimate the amount of aguardiente in the bottle and fill the shot glass accordingly. The relative order of initiating the drinking act with the several persons present must proceed from persons of greater rank to persons of lesser rank. As has been suggested in the role inventory, there is a near-perfect correlation between age and rank in Aguacatenango. Hence, the oldest male present is served first and the youngest male present is served next to last, the drink pourer himself being served last. Since the drink server is a junior male, his relative position of drinking is not far from his actual position--that is, he would have been served near the end of the drinking sequence in any case. (It may be the case that the depression of his status by being served last is compensated for by the fact that a person of senior status, the host, serves him.)

When the drink server has offered a drink to each man in the group, he returns the bottle to its owner, and the owner initiates the drinking act with the drink server. This act terminates the drinking sequence. After it is terminated, no drinking acts take place for a period of time generally as long as the drinking sequence itself. All drinking acts, then, take place within drinking sequences.

The relative positioning of drinking acts in the drinking sequence distinguishes the participants by rank. In such a context, the isolatable drinking act encodes one's own rank relative to all other persons present, or, alternatively, each person's rank relative to every other. In the drinking sequence the drinking act assumes symbolic value. It measures one's status. It takes on a code value on the dimension of status. The drinking sequence is a message, then, which encodes an individual's rank, the particular value of rank in this message being determined by the position in the message which any particular individual's coded value falls.

Many if not most of the inferences that human beings draw about the state of their environment are deduced as the result of the communication of information encoded in some one or more media. The determination and certification of an individual's social rank is one type of inference and action that individuals engage in in Aguacatenango. Rank and role are not only encoded in the drinking performances, but also in a variety of other media as well. When we examine the ceremonial drinking cycle as it occurs in the civil and religious hierarchies, it becomes clear that the arrangement of persons in space, modes of greating, modes of offering toasts, the differential access to settings, etc., all may encode an individual's social position just as do the set of role labels that may be used to identify him.

After the settlement of a dispute, after having agreed to permit a /HTUL YAN LUMAL/, “foreigner,” to settle in the community, and on certain saints' days (especially those saints associated with the installation of new civil officers), the /[unknown]A[unknown]TELETIK TA KABILTO/, or civil hierarchy, is given or secures for itself aguardiente in liter bottles. The aguardiente is equally distributed in shot glass amounts among the members of the /[unknown]A[unknown]TELETIK/, a particular individual drinking the glass which is offered him; or alternative should he choose not to drink it, taking a sip from it and handing it to some other member of the group who drinks the remaining portion and returns the glass to the first drinker, who in turn returns it to the pourer of drinks. It is in the succession of drink-pouring to the several members that we observe an orderly recurring pattern.

The drink pourer, who is one of the /REHIDOR-ETIK/, proceeds directly to the /HWES/. The REHIDOR/ carefully pours the drink, picking any dirt from the liquid, and hands it to this individual. The /HWES/ then offers the drinking salute: /LISENSYA TAT/, “With your pardon, sir.” The other members of the group respond with /[unknown]OCAN TAT/, or alternatively /[unknown]OCAN TATA[unknown]/, “down it, sir,” or, “down it, respected sir.” The drink pourer /REHIDOR/ then proceeds to serve succeeding persons down the rank order. The rank order may be observed in the seating arrangements displayed in Table 11 (p. 60). Beginning at the door, the relative order of succession is down the page, through the position /SINTIKO/. Then the position just above the door is served and so on through an adjacent succession through the position of /XWAXKEBAL MAYOR/.

One of the important performance correlates of the role of mayordomo is to engage in the drinking of aguardiente. Almost without exception, the mayordomos as a group drink themselves into a state of deep drunkenness on each of the seven fiesta days. The initiation of the drinking takes place on the porch of the annex of the church. Benches run the length of the porch on its inside and outside edges. As the mayordomos as-.semble, they seat themselves initially on the inside of the two benches. The relative order of seating is as follows: ....

The drinking of aguardiente takes place on the porch after the men are seated. Again the aguardiente is distributed in shot glass amounts to each member of the mayordomia. Again, as in the case of the civil officials, a strict relative order of succession of drinking is followed, proceeding from the top of Table 12 (p. 61) to the bottom.

In both the referential sets of civil officials and religious officials, then, there are occasions when both seating arrangements and drinking arrangements uniquely express a relative order property in the relations between members of each set. This relative order property we can call differential rank . While this type of rank is a somewhat special case, it is essentially the same age differential which establishes rank in the community at large. The civil and religious hierarchies are very nearly age-graded, the higher-ranking positions being occupied by older men. A survey of the histories of individuals' cargos indicates that the age grading is more strict in the case of the mayordomos than in the case of the civil officials. In each set of officials, men with adjacent ranks sit next to each other and drink in succession, the man with the higher rank sitting in an arbitrarily defined higher position on the bench and drinking sooner. It is important to note that of a variety of ways in which the aguardiente could be used to express the rank difference (e.g., the distribution of larger amounts to the senior positions), only relative order of drinking is used. It is the arbitrary selection of order as the medium of communication of roles and ranks that leads us to describe drinking performances as a code.

We have observed that on the occasion of ceremonial drinking, not only will the relative age differences of the adult males be expressed in the relative order in which they are served aguardiente, but so also will they arrange themselves spatially in such a way that the drink server will be able to meet the obligation of serving the older person first without skipping anyone in the seating order. In other words, men, in the first stages of ceremonial drinking, will arrange themselves in order of relative age-rank, and thus receive in perfect spatial and temporal succession the aguardiente which they drink.

The ceremonial drinking sequence is associated with the presence of a marimba which plays throughout the course of the fiesta and the departure of which signals the termination of the same. While the marimba players are paid to play at the fiesta, with regard to the consumption of aguardiente they are treated as are all other males who are present. In some cases, they will be offered drinks with greater frequency to begin with, as it is supposed by the host that they will play more frequently and will charge less if they are somewhat intoxicated.

The ceremonial drinking sequence is regularly associated with the serving of food by the sponsors to the guests. The alternate possibilities are included in the following table: .... The relative prestige of the food served increases with the descending order.

The duration of a ceremonial drinking cycle is well-defined. It does not last beyond an eight-hour period, in general. Its termination is marked, as has been noted above, by the departure of the marimba from the scene and by the fact that the host ceases to serve aguardiente. Individuals who continue to drink after the ceremonial cycle is terminated do so under informal drinking rules.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual98,The Blessing of the Girls (ukupala amate),"The Blessing of the Girls (ukupala amate)

The first rite of the ceremony took place on May 31st. I was told that the headman of the village called the blessing of his ancestral spirits in the early morning. This he did by spitting into the air and calling on the names of his ancestors. I did not see this rite but it is the common Bemba practice in ceremonies of the kind.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual99,The Hierarchy of the Elders,"The hierarchy of the elders . The ceremony opened with a ritual representation of the hierarchy of rank among the women present. It was the first of one of the series of such acts that took place over and over again throughout the ceremony. Nangoshye squatted on her toes with her knees bent and jogged up and down to the drums. She picked up in her mouth two small enamel bowls that covered baskets of seeds. Picking up one of the baskets in her mouth, she offered it to the oldest woman present and the latter, in turn, started jogging up and down and offering the basket to the women below her in rank and so on in exact order of age.

(‘We are honouring the great ones, these are the big banacimbusa from the district.’ ‘Why?’ ‘We just have to honour them’ ( Tule bacindikafye ) said with an impatient shrug at my stupidity.)

There followed a series of solo dances done by the old women. The rhythm of the drums was definitely of the chisunga type, but some of the songs did not seem to be connected with the ceremony. The tone of the company was serious throughout. The two girls themselves hardly ever ventured to peep out from under their blanket coverings. When they did, they looked frightened and shy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual100,The Enclosure of the Girls (ukusakila banacisungu),"The Enclosure of the Girls (ukusakila banacisungu)

After about an hour spent in this way, the company rushed out with a good deal of laughter and talking to a small mufungo tree that stood on the village garden mounds. The two girls trailed behind, still covered by blankets, pushed and shoved along by the younger helpers. There were no men present and young children were warned off by excited screams. Nangoshye sat down by the mufungo tree and began pulling out leaves with her mouth. Then she made the girls crouch against the stem of the tree while the women built a sort of windscreen of branches round them. This was described as ‘hiding the girls’.

(‘They are hiding them from the young girls and children.’) 

Making fish-traps for the girls (ukuteela banacisungu)

Quite suddenly, Nangoshye shouted new directions. With screams of merriment, each women began to snatch at a mufungo bush for leaves. These pear-shaped leaves they folded into cones to resemble the small conical fish traps used by the Bemba. They sang a song about setting fish traps (No. 2) and ran round laughing as they pretended to catch each others’ fingers in the leaf traps.

(‘It is a parable.’ ( Ni milumbe ) ‘The fish has many children and so will the girl.’ ‘It represents the organ of the man.’)

The girls’ first jump (ukuciluka banacisungu)

More shouted orders from Nangoshye and the piled-up branches were snatched away from round the girls as they cowered at the foot of the tree. The boughs were stacked on their backs and roughly tied, and they were made to crawl a few yards in this position. Then the branches were pulled off again and piled into a heap about two feet high. The girls were told to jump over it. Both scuttled across the open space like frightened rabbits to the accompaniment of screams of encouragement and threats from all around. (‘Don’t tremble!’ ‘Don’t be frightened, you silly girls.’ ‘Jump now! Jump high.’) The girls were evidently nervous to a degree, and one failed to manage the moderate jump expected and had to try again and again. When both the girls were over, there was an outburst of congratulation. Nangoshye rubbed red cam wood ( nkula ) on the faces and shoulders of all the older women present and on me as the giver of the chisungu. This red powder used to be rubbed on returning warriors and men who had passed successfully through the poison ordeal; and it is still daubed on lion-killers.

Nangoshye picked up her paternal niece and carried her across her back, and the other girl was shouldered by her own father’s sister. The two old women led the procession back to the village carrying the girls shoulder high as chiefs or brides are carried as a sign of honour.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual101,The First Woodland Ceremony,"The First Woodland Ceremony

Taking them out to the bush (ukufumisha banacisungu mumpanga) . On the seventh day we were all summoned to the hut at about nine in the morning. The banacisungu were bundled in under rugs as before. Each was then hobbled by having one foot strapped with bark rope to her thigh, so she could only hop on the remaining leg, and had to be supported by an older woman. Both girls looked embarrassed, and hid their faces as they came out to the public gaze.

(‘We are doing that just to tease the girls. That is what they did to us when we were initiated.’ With evident relish, another added, ‘We always do that to tease the girls.’)

Outside the village, the girls’ legs were untied but they still had to walk naked except for a cloth around the waist. They strode in front with heads hanging in acute shame. Behind them came a swarm of gesticulating women, running, shouting and scrambling. Two or three ran off into the bush to look for some of the emblems that would be needed for the rest of the ceremony—a special creeper used to tie up other emblems, and supple branches to be used to make mock bows. The young girls of the village followed behind carrying drums on their heads.

The gardening mimes

We stopped at a large musuku tree, about an hour’s walk away from the village. The base of the tree was quickly cleared of undergrowth with a hoe, and Nangoshye and her younger helpers began hopping round the trunk of the tree like frogs followed by the banacisungu . They sang ‘O, you wild pig, come and hoe up the rough grass.’ (Song No. 7.)

‘Because the pigs root up the ground.’ ‘It is to train the girl to hoe.’ ‘It is to teach her to work hard now she is married.’

After about ten minutes, the group broke up and formed up again into another dance representing the guinea-fowl. The women pretended to churn up the ground with their feet and sang calling on the birds to come (No. 8). ‘You guinea-fowl come here and wait!’

(‘That is the way we teach them. The guinea-fowl scratches up the soil. If a girl idles and they scold her, then she remembers the teaching of the chisungu, and she will say, “This is what they told me about the guinea-fowl!”!’ Cf. also p. 30.)

All the main actors then pretended to sow seeds they had brought with them in a basket—maize, ground nuts and beans. After ‘sowing’ them, they scraped the seeds up with their hands, singing (No. 9):

‘The small garden,
The garden of the ground-nuts.’

(‘It is just to teach the girl how to garden.’) 

The heat was now intense. Sweat poured down Nangoshye’s face and back, but she was indefatigable. She kept urging her helpers and the banacisungu to sing louder and to dance harder.

She then picked up the maize cob in her mouth and gave it to the girls to bite. Everyone sang over and over again (No. 10): ‘The tortoise never climbs, but today he is climbing the mukolobondo tree.’

(Subsequent interpretations were varied. P.B.M. ‘You see, tortoises do not climb, but today they are climbing. The girl must learn to do impossible things. Even though she is not a man, she must climb trees to get firewood if it is needed.’ An old nacimbusa ‘They teach the girl to go and fetch firewood—if she does not know how to use an axe she must do it if her husband is away.’ A younger nacimbusa ‘It is just a story. If the husband commits adultery, she must say nothing about it. She has just to ignore it. We teach her this so that she can remember “This is the thing they taught me about the tortoise”.’)

The maize cob was then tied with special creepers to a branch of the tree, and Nangoshye and the two elder women dodged to get it into their mouths. Then a girl climbed up and tied the maize cob to a high bough. The banacisungu had to try to climb up, leg first. They were finally helped on to the bough by the younger helpers.

(‘The girls are to imitate monkeys because the monkeys eat everything on the trees.’ ‘The monkey is always stealing. A good wife must try to find food for her family whenever she can. This song is to make the girls imitate the monkey.’) 

‘The monkey eats everything that bears freely
That is why he climbs the mukolobondo tree.’ (No. 11)
‘The monkey calls its mother.’ (No. 12)

The honouring of the musuku tree

The next rite was the blessing of the musuku tree which is one of the symbols of womanhood in this tribe. It was described as ‘ukusapila mbusa’ . Two small rings of white beads were tied round twigs of the tree and the girls were made to bite them off in their mouths and give them to Nangoshye. Having taken the decorated twigs in her mouth, she began to jog up and down and to offer them in her mouth to the elder banacimbusa in order of seniority. Each one went down on her knees and reached out both hands to take the twigs covered with the saliva of the woman who offered them. As each woman took the emblem she made the ulla ulla sound of general congratulation.

(‘The girls are to get firewood always now.’ ‘It is to honour the musuku tree. If we did not do this there would be no parenthood for the girls.’ ‘Why?’ ‘Because the musuku is a tree that bears much fruit.’ ‘This is called “the blessing of the child’s mbusa with spittle”.’ ( ukupalila imbusa shya umwana ).

Then came the first singing of the song, ‘The arm-pit can never be higher than the shoulder’ (No. 13) which was repeated so often during the subsequent rites. The song appears to represent the unalterable prerogatives of age. As a man’s arm-pit can never be higher than his shoulder so the younger can never be more important than the older.

Preparation of the emblem bundles

Bundles of domestic emblems were now made up. These consisted of things commonly used in daily life—firewood, salt, meat, tobacco, the various seeds used in cooking, red cam wood powder, twigs of trees with magic properties and particularly of the woman’s trees ( mwenge, mufungu and musuku ).

There followed an interminable series of songs. The initiation candidates hung uncomfortably from the branches of the tree, while beneath the emblems were offered, taken in the mouth and honoured by each of the women in turn, the company singing over and over again:

‘Let me pick it up
Let me pick it up with my mouth.
My mbusa.’ ( No. 14)

At last, the girls were brought down from the tree and with five or six of the younger helpers they were told to lead a round dance. They were shy, tied and awkward, and the dance went lamely. It was evidently important, however, that an impression of jollity should be given for the older women sat round them screeching vehemently, ‘Rejoice, can’t you? You girls, why can’t you manage to rejoice?’ Asked why this was necessary, Nangoshye said shortly, ‘They must do it for respect.’

The mock bridegrooms

It was now between one and two o’clock, and we turned to go back to the village. As we went, two women dashed across the front of the procession shouting. They had armed themselves with toy bows and arrows and had tied twigs round their heads. They had leaf cups similar to those of the fish trap ceremony hung all over them. They were shouldering a long sapling on which hung a piece of ant-hill to represent a load. They had stained themselves all over with the red power.

These were the sisters of the bridegrooms and they were greeted with shrieks of delighted laughter, ‘Here come the bridegrooms.’ The two women imitated the swaggering gait of young gallants, and pretended to speak in bass voices. They carried male symbols—the bow and arrow, the red cam wood powder of the successful warrior and lion-killer, and the salt, which the husband had to fetch for the household in the old days. The twigs round their heads were said to represent the circlets worn formerly by magicians, and the leaf cups might well have been fertility symbols, though I did not ask.

We formed into a triumphant procession as we neared the village. Everyone carried branches or imitation bundles of firewood on their backs. Even the children who ran in front, shouting, had tiny faggots strapped on their backs. The mock bridegrooms followed and behind them came the banacisungu with the emblem bundles strapped on to their shoulders.

As we got near the first houses, the two girls were made to crawl single file with some of their companions, and then they were hidden by a couple of mats carried like a screen round them. The women waved their branches to and fro and began to surge first forward and then backward—four steps forward very slowly behind the crawling girls, and then four steps backward. They sang again and again (No. 15).

‘Mark one step after the other
Let us not turn back.’

(‘The crawling backwards is to teach the girls obedience.’)

The mother-daughter rite

The procession wound interminably on, forward and back, forward and back, until we reached the house of one of the girl’s mothers. Here the banacisungu were told to lie down and to put their heads first on a bunch of sorghum and then on some clusters of finger millet. These are the two most important cereal foods of the tribe. The seeds had been thrown there by the girl’s mother.

(The mother says, ‘I shall get every kind of seed and give it to my child.’ This sentence was repeated by several women with great pleasure and confidence. It seemed to be the ritual acknowledgement of the mother’s duty to provide food and to cook for her married daughter for some years after the wedding has taken place.)

The mock bridegrooms suddenly reappeared, pretending this time to be lame old men who could hardly walk. Again the same delighted screams of, ‘Here are the shibwinga ’ and the shouted badinage with the mock old men, who came this time with horns of leaves on their heads. The company started singing a song about fetching salt.

The whole procession danced three times round the girls who stood in the centre with downcast eyes. Then the crowd moved off to sing in front of the house of the bridegroom’s (classificatory) mother. His own mother lived in a village elsewhere.

The hidden emblems

We then turned back to the chisungu hut where another type of mbusa had been hidden in the hut roof. Presents such as copper bangles would have been used in the old days, but on this occasion heads of millet were thought sufficient. The women all pretended to look for the mbusa while singing a song. (No. 16)

‘You look for a little snake for me on the roof.’

The test of maturity

We crowded into the hut in which the fire had been extinguished preparatory to its ritual relighting later in the day. Two large water pots were set on the floor and into each was put one of the little darting water insects known as njelela . The dancing and the drumming started up and Nangoshye alternately jogged up and down on bent knees and tried to catch the little insects in her mouth. It seemed an almost impossible task and she failed, after many efforts, and much encouragement. Then the two girls themselves set to work, this time with unwonted animation. Both succeeded in catching an njelela and spitting it into the hands of Nangoshye to the sound of much clapping and ululation.

This rite which was carried out with all the laughter and excitement of a game of snap-dragon at an English Christmas party was evidently considered of some importance. It seemed to be a test of the maturity of the girls in the sense of their acquisition of that important social attribute of every Bemba— mano, or social sense.

(‘They try to find out if the girls have grown up ( nga nabakula ).’ ‘If the girl doesn’t catch the njelela the women all know “She has not yet acquired mano ”, and the mother has to pay a forfeit.’)

The girls made free to offer food

Two large winnowing baskets were then brought in and filled with ground nuts, peas and beans. One had a small basin with a collection of miscellaneous objects in it—a bracelet, a maize cob, some salt, some snuff, etc. These again were described as mbusa . Both of the baskets were covered with lids as food is covered when it is carried as a token of respect. There followed more offerings of respect to the nacimbusa . Drums and singing went on incessantly, the company jogging up and down with bent knees as before and a younger woman uncovering the basket with her mouth, picking up seeds in her mouth and dropping them into Nangoshye’s hands. They sang, among other songs (No. 17):

‘You have uncovered it.
You have eaten the whole nsomo.’

The mbusa were looked for, found, picked up with the mouth again and handed to and fro. Again came the song of the arm-pit not being higher than the shoulder. All this was described as, ‘It is a way of honouring the senior people’ ( ukucindika abakalamba ).

Then the girls were pulled to the front and told to invite the company to eat. They sang:

‘The food from our gardens is finished.
Help yourselves, mothers’ (No. 18)

(‘We older women say, “Now we have danced the child as a gardener. She must start to cultivate herself now”.’ ( Fwe abakalamba twacindila umwana wa umulimi. Nomba ali no kulimishva. ))

There followed an endless business of handling the seeds which were offered to everyone present in order of seniority and then handed back. It was a relief when the father of one of the girls danced into the hut and did a capering solo in honour of the nacimbusa, throwing a cheap bracelet into one of the baskets. He was criticized as being mean in his gift, but the dance was done with great dash and gaiety.

The ritual lighting of the girls’ fire (namushimwa)

An important stage in the ceremony had now been reached—the lighting of the new fire. This might be described as the first of the rites of aggregation. The senior ‘father’s sister’ of one of the girls, wrinkled and bent with rheumatism, danced to the company and then lay down on her back. Nangoshye picked up a fire stick and started twirling it round in the groove on the old woman’s thigh, telling the two girls to copy her afterwards. Then the two old women set out to make fire in earnest. Women do not commonly make fire among the Bemba. The work needs skill and practice as well as considerable strength. The two old women rubbed the fire stick in turns, sweating and groaning with the effort. The company swayed to and fro moaning the chisungu fire songs:

‘We have come to beg fire,
Lion we beg it of you.’ (No. 19) and 
‘Scratch, Scratch (The grating of the fire-sticks),
How many children have you borne?’ (No. 20)

After half an hour of growing anxiety, I offered a box of matches which are commonly reckoned as ‘new fire’ in Bemba ceremonial. This was received with shocked protest, ‘No, this isn’t just ordinary fire. Alas, Mother! We can’t use matches.’ It seemed an impasse.

At last, to the intense relief of everyone, the wood shaving set to catch the sparks began to smoke and a little flame flickered up. Clapping broke out and cries of ‘ulla! ulla!’ saluted the new fire. It was a curiously moving moment because of the tenseness of the women packed tight on the floor of the hut through the long wait.

The rite is described shortly as ‘to beg for parenthood’ ( ukulomba ubufyashi ). The father’s sister plays the leading part in the ceremony and it is she who by tradition influences the fertility of the girl. ‘The sticks must be rubbed on the back of the father’s sister so that the girl will bear a child quickly.’

(As we have seen the lion is equated throughout this ceremony with the bridegroom, the chief, or the male principle. Two women when questioned about the song (No. 19) just said, ‘The lion is a chief.’ Fire is also equated with generation. The girl owes parenthood to the older women who have made fire for her, ‘We say to the girl “We women have made your fire for you. We are in pain now. Our hands ache from the rubbing. You must take over now”.’)

Twigs and sticks were deftly built round the young flame and a considerable fire began to crackle. Nangoshye crawled towards it on all fours with a water pot on her head. The two girls crawled behind her clasping their arms round her waist. All three lowered the water pot on to the fire with hands and teeth. I have no recorded comments on this part of the rite. I think it almost certainly symbolizes the heating of the marriage pot of the girl which is stood on the fire by an old woman with the bridegroom and bride clasping her waist. It may also signify the handing over of the fire from the old to the young as suggested in the comment above.

The seeds in the winnowing basket were now divided out so that each woman had a handful to cook. The remains were thrown into the big pot over the fire, the pot of the namushimwa . We all retired exhausted to our own quarters to eat for the first time since morning.

The teasing of the girls (ukubacushya)

About seven the same evening, the women gathered again in the hut. Young children were turned out and the banacisungu were fetched.

Nangoshye put a basket on her head covered with a white cloth. She knelt on the ground and danced up and down with it, finally offering it to the two banacisungu in turn. Everyone watched anxiously to see whether they would cry. One girl burst into tears at once and was greeted with roars of appreciative laughter. The other did not weep at all, and was immediately smacked by her relatives who shouted, ‘You child you! Cry a bit! Cry a little bit!’ The excitement rose as the women burst into a crooning song, ‘I make you cry. . . .’

(All women had an explanation for the ukucushya . They used such phrases as ‘If they cry we know that they have understood. Otherwise we say, “That is a citontolo ! She doesn’t hear. She doesn’t respect authority”.’)

The rest of the evening was spent in similar efforts to make the banacisungu cry. I watched seven different singing games in which the girls were pulled about and tormented. Their legs were stretched out; the backs and faces were rubbed with dust (‘to teach them to wash’). They were rolled on the ground; they were pummelled all over; they were stood against the wall and made to imitate a crying noise, which the shyer of the two completely failed to do. They were swung to and fro by fingers hooked inside their mouths. Their heads were bound with grass above the eyes so that the eye-balls stood out.

The two girls were strained and taut, under a constant fire of criticism, and apparently simply concentrated on following blindly the commands shouted at them. The company sometimes gave the impression of boisterous high spirits and sometimes seemed to be acting as though they were bravely carrying out a tedious duty. If the games flagged for an instant, Nangoshye shouted, peremptorily, ‘Come on, friends. We must keep on tormenting the banacisungu ’ and the weary women started up another song. Most of the songs had some moral associated with them, such as in No. 21, which was said to tell the girl not to sit on the village square with idle friends who might teach her to abuse her husband, or No. 26, which was to warn her not to finish up her granary at once like the hawk pouncing on food.

I left the hut at half past eleven at night but the dancing went on till half past three, and there was desultory singing till the cock crew.

The women then tasted the stew made of the seeds cooked in the namushimwa pot and drifted away to their homes. The banacisungu were told not to sleep, but to go out and fetch more clay for the modelling to be done during the day.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Ritual102,Test of Maturity,"The test of maturity

We crowded into the hut in which the fire had been extinguished preparatory to its ritual relighting later in the day. Two large water pots were set on the floor and into each was put one of the little darting water insects known as njelela .

Ritual103,Ritual Lighting (?),"On important ritual occasions, such as the ‘warming’ of a new village site, the installation of a chief, a marriage, a death, or the protection rites for a young child, the old fire must be extinguished and a new fire lit with fire-sticks or matches, and the floor of the hut freshly mudded over. These are signs that the pollution is definitely removed. The fire is also harmed by objects or persons that are ‘cold’. Contact with a dead body makes a fire cold, or contact with a menstruating woman, who is described in polite speech as ‘being in a state of coldness’ ( Akuba na mpepo ) or as ‘fearing fire’ ( atina umulilo ). People who eat food cooked on the fire by such women are liable to illness.

Ritual104,The Teasing of the Girls,"The teasing of the girls (ukubacushya)

About seven the same evening, the women gathered again in the hut. Young children were turned out and the banacisungu were fetched.

Nangoshye put a basket on her head covered with a white cloth. She knelt on the ground and danced up and down with it, finally offering it to the two banacisungu in turn. Everyone watched anxiously to see whether they would cry. One girl burst into tears at once and was greeted with roars of appreciative laughter. The other did not weep at all, and was immediately smacked by her relatives who shouted, ‘You child you! Cry a bit! Cry a little bit!’ The excitement rose as the women burst into a crooning song, ‘I make you cry. . . .’

(All women had an explanation for the ukucushya . They used such phrases as ‘If they cry we know that they have understood. Otherwise we say, “That is a citontolo ! She doesn’t hear. She doesn’t respect authority”.’)

The rest of the evening was spent in similar efforts to make the banacisungu cry. I watched seven different singing games in which the girls were pulled about and tormented. Their legs were stretched out; the backs and faces were rubbed with dust (‘to teach them to wash’). They were rolled on the ground; they were pummelled all over; they were stood against the wall and made to imitate a crying noise, which the shyer of the two completely failed to do. They were swung to and fro by fingers hooked inside their mouths. Their heads were bound with grass above the eyes so that the eye-balls stood out.

The two girls were strained and taut, under a constant fire of criticism, and apparently simply concentrated on following blindly the commands shouted at them. The company sometimes gave the impression of boisterous high spirits and sometimes seemed to be acting as though they were bravely carrying out a tedious duty. If the games flagged for an instant, Nangoshye shouted, peremptorily, ‘Come on, friends. We must keep on tormenting the banacisungu ’ and the weary women started up another song. Most of the songs had some moral associated with them, such as in No. 21, which was said to tell the girl not to sit on the village square with idle friends who might teach her to abuse her husband, or No. 26, which was to warn her not to finish up her granary at once like the hawk pouncing on food.

I left the hut at half past eleven at night but the dancing went on till half past three, and there was desultory singing till the cock crew.

The women then tasted the stew made of the seeds cooked in the namushimwa pot and drifted away to their homes. The banacisungu were told not to sleep, but to go out and fetch more clay for the modelling to be done during the day.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual105,Eleventh Day,"Eleventh Day The Festive Porridge Easting (bwali bwa ukuangala)

I was called in the middle of the morning to see an enormous cooking-pot full of water being set on the fire in the hut of the mother of one of the girls. Ordinary porridge was to be made, but the cooking itself was a ritual act. The flour was first stirred in by Nangoshye, who then handed over the spoon to one of the girl’s maternal relatives. When the meal was cooked the girl’s maternal grandmother was called to dish up the porridge and to hide mbusa in it. She filled a great enamel basin with porridge served in the usual way, and then stuck on top of it a small rounded lump of the cooked meal filled with the domestic mbusa (tobacco, salt, beads, meat, red dye and a small lump of whitewash). The whole was then decorated with marrow seeds and red dye and carried to the chisungu hut. Here a similar bowl had been prepared by the mother of the second girl and it stood waiting with the accompanying relish beside it.

It was a day of offering and receiving offerings—from the girls’ mothers to the banacimbusa; from the younger nacimbusa to the older in order of seniority; from the initiated women to the girls. It was a display of ceremonial obligation, of precedence, of mucinci, to use the common Bemba term. The younger helpers danced with the porridge bowls on their heads while the banacisungu were pushed in backwards, again on all fours, to the singing of the entering-in song (No. 15). The porridge bowls were ceremonially uncovered and covered again with ululation. The girls’ paternal relatives seized the dishes and offered them to all present in order of seniority. The bowls were then put on the girls’ own heads and they were made to dance round with them to show their respect to the banacimbusa present.

Singing games followed. The two senior paternal relatives of the girls pretended to chase each other off a small stool with Nangoshye scolding them and the company singing, ‘Don’t sit on the stool.’ (No. 26) This was said to represent the Bemba custom of chasing the Shimwalule, the official burier of the Citimukulu from office after he had performed the mortuary ritual required of him.

The same two old women next pretended to hunt and spear fish under the porridge bowl. This was explained as, ‘The girl tries to hide food from her mother-in-law and asks her friends to keep the matter dark.’

Nangoshye picked up a porridge bowl pretending it was too heavy to carry. The women sang about a bat (No. 25) who represents the woman who goes out to hunt for lovers in the dark. They also sang another song about the hawk who pounces down on food without ceremony—which no girl should do. (No. 26)

The girls were then made to touch each bowl all over and each lid was again picked off in a woman’s mouth and offered to each elder in order of precedence. The oldest paternal aunt, Nacitembo (see page 62) then gave each girl a small lump of porridge and took it back; she then hid some of the porridge on the roof.

The hidden mbusa were now to be shown to the company. Nacitembo, as the oldest woman present and the representative of the father’s side of one girls’ families, danced holding the small balls of porridge filled with the domestic emblems. The two girls were stood against the wall under their own wall marks. Paternal relatives stood one on each side of them and passed the balls with the hidden emblems from side to side across them. This was to make them free to eat all the foods. It was, in other words, the removal of the girls’ food taboos.

The company burst into song which goes with the representation of the washing of the husband’s hands, (see page 202) and the girls’ hands were washed. The paternal aunt danced out in front and kept pretending to show the hidden mbusa to the girls and fighting with Nangoshye who pretended reluctance to let them be seen.

The endless giving and taking came suddenly to an end in one of those dramatic moments that move even the weariest onlooker. The women broke into a song of unusual melody (No. 41):

Cibale! Cibale!
Come and wash your husband!
You ignorant creature,
Go and draw water,
Cibale! Cibale!

A younger nacimbusa, dancing with great vitality and charm, bent as though to pour water on the hands of every woman present in order of the assembled hierarchy. She pretended to whitewash the floor beneath each and bowed low to clap obeisance.

The company were roused to excitement immediately. To my questions they whispered: ‘That is respect!’ ‘That is how the woman honours her husband. That is how he knows she has been taught. If a woman does not know how to wash her husband’s hands, he will say, “That is not a woman. She is like someone who hasn’t been danced!” ’ ( Canakashi! Cabanga bashicindile! )

The tension seemed to break. The ceremony was over. The porridge was divided up in a business-like way and each family took its portion. There was scrapping about the size of the bowls and a general return to normal life.

In the late afternoon, dancing began again and at night the teasing of the girls went on once more. One girl cried at once and was applauded. The other girl was throughout more stocky and reserved. A woman said to me: ‘Well, we can’t give her up! We must go on and on trying to teach her.’

Ritual106,Fourteenth Day,"Fourteenth Day The Whitening Magic (ukuya ku mpemba)

When the mid-day meal was over the drums began to beat and the village women gathered outside the chisungu hut. We went in straggling procession down to the river and stood by the soft black mud that lined the banks. Nangoshye took a mouthful of the dirty water and sprayed it in the air. Everyone clapped and ululated.

(The rite seemed significant in the sense that the performers were serious and interested, but I could not interpret it fully. I was told it was to teach the girl not to pretend to be thirsty when she had already drunk. The spraying of saliva in the air is the usual Bemba way of asking the blessing of the ancestors.) 

A small hollow was then cleared in the wet mud and Nangoshye balanced herself on both elbows over it, swinging herself to and fro above the muddy pool.

The women sang:

‘ Following the ways of God
We imitate our mothers .’ (No. 27)

(The details of this ceremony are obscure to me. Nangoshye explained that she swung over the hole in the mud to ‘imitate our mothers who bore us’ and implied she was representing the act of birth. She also said she was teaching the girls how they were to bathe in the river during menstruation, that is to say, apart from others so as not to contaminate the stream. P.B.M. referred to the song sung at the same time as meaning ‘Sometimes we do not follow Lesa (God) but follow our mothers.’ This seemed to be an explanation of a Christian type, but the idea of the passing down of tradition and the passing down of the child from the womb seemed to be implicit. A.C. writes: ‘It is our duty to follow God, to pass on knowledge as we had it passed on to us. We make you a mother as your mothers were to you.’)

The banacisungu were then pulled forward. Their clothes were kilted round the waist and they were pushed into the muddy water and thoroughly splashed all over. Then they were washed, cleansed and covered over body and face with whitewash. The white clay was brushed on with meticulous care with a grass brush. A lump of black mud was put cross-shaped on the head of each girl and decorated with the usual pumpkin seeds and red dye. Their heads were then covered with a cloth and, still with down-cast eyes and apparent embarrassment, they led the procession back to the village. The women sang:

‘ We tracked a lion in our garden and reported it,
The hunter has not forgotten .’ (No. 28)

They also sang again and again a song about the white egret (No. 48) as they surrounded the whitened forms of the girls and danced them back to the village.

As we came near the houses men sitting in the doorways of their huts lowered their eyes ostentatiously as we passed.

We assembled at the initiation hut and began again songs and offerings of respect to the nacimbusa in order of precedence. All the relatives in the hut were touched with white clay. The girls were then led to the house of the village headmen who ‘spat the blessings of the spirits’ on them, ( ukupala amate ).

(This ceremony, literally ‘going to whitewash’, seemed to be thought rather romantic and interesting by the women. They referred to the girls throughout in an almost sentimental way as English women speak of the beauty of brides on their wedding day. ‘We make the girls white. We make them beautiful.’ ‘We make them white like egrets.’ ‘Yes, they are white now from the stain of the blood.’ ‘It is finished now, the thing that was red.’)

The ukuya kumpemba seems to mark a definite stage in the ritual. It is a rite of purification from the menstrual blood and a form of beauty magic. It is followed by the second calling of the blessings of the ancestral spirits.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual107,Seventeeth Day,"Seventeeth Day The Second Woodland Ceremony

Bringing the girls out of doors (ukubafumya panse) . The day opened with a good deal of discussion and coming and going. I was told this was the day for bringing the girls out of doors, and I definitely had the impression that a new and important stage in the proceedings had been reached. We were to go out into the bush to a mwenge tree, and there was a hot altercation among the older women as to which tree would be most suitable. The rest of the company gathered at the initiation hut, the two candidates looking for once quite cheerful with their clothes tucked above their breasts as Bemba women usually wear them. Their serenity was, however, short-lived, for Nangoshye immediately spotted them on joining the group. ‘Pull your clothes off your breasts,’ she shouted imperiously. ‘Who do you think you are? People of status?’

The women seemed to be tired and there was quarrelling over the mbusa to be carried into the bush—an enamel bowl with the domestic emblems, salt, tobacco, white chalk, red dye and beads; a winnowing basket full of ground-nuts; and two of the pottery emblems which resemble a pot and its cover but are known as the garden mound ( mputa ) and the garden ( amabala ) (Cf. p. 96). A small gourd of beer was also carried by one of the younger girls who kept eating the sludge on its side with one finger although constantly rebuked for doing so. We made one or two false starts owing to someone having forgotten axes or hoes which were to be needed. In fact, I had the general impression that morale was low. Either the company was exhausted or else they had the feeling that the ceremony was coming to an end or that this particular rite was not of great significance.

Honouring the mwenge tree

One of the older women had cut a supple branch of a mwenge tree en route, and we assembled at the base of a tree of this kind. There followed one of the rites of ‘honouring the mbusa ’ repeated so often during the chisungu. The vessels in which the emblems were carried were covered and uncovered by the leading actors, and the banacimbusa present were offered the same objects ritually in order of precedence. It was characteristic of this particular ceremony that every object touched was handled with the mouth and not the hand. Nangoshye picked grass with her mouth from under the tree and spat it over the mbusa . She spat red cam wood powder over the roots of the mwenge tree. She took a hoe in her mouth and started to clear a space under the tree, only taking the implement in her hands to finish the clearing more completely. Throughout the rite the drums were going and the women sang, (No. 14):

‘Pick up what you have,
Pick up things with the mouth.’

As objects were offered in order to the older women they sang again the song of precedence:

‘The arm-pit is not higher than the shoulder.’

Everyone seemed rather bored and hot under the midday sun. Nangoshye had to exert all her authority to keep the party going. She scolded them for leaving behind one of the domestic emblems—the whitewash. ‘It isn’t a laughing matter to dance the chisungu’ she said. She continued singing with the rest of the lack-lustre company, but in an exasperated sort of way as though anxious to get through with a tedious task, yet under compulsion not to skimp the work.

(This part of the ceremony was described as the honouring of the mwenge tree. It will be remembered that the musuku tree, the female tree representing fertility, was honoured in the same way during the first bush ceremony (p. 70). The mwenge is another female tree, representing apparently the pliancy of the woman, just as the mulombwa, the hard-wood tree which exudes a red juice, represents the male, the lion, and in some cases the chief.

The act of picking up objects with the mouth was described as a method of honouring the mbusa or the mwenge tree, with the complementary remark that things were picked up in the mouth because it was unusual. The girls must learn to do unusual things, said one woman.)

The drinking of the beer

Nangoshye then dug a small hole in the ground under the mwenge tree and poured the small gourd of beer into it. The earth seemed to hold the thick sludge of the beer and its foam frothed level with the surface of the ground. Nangoshye scattered red dye powder, small rings of white beads and lumps of white clay on top. She was still exasperated and paused to scold the helpers: ‘Who has drunk some of the beer on the way down?’ she asked. This was a serious matter and not just a time when you could snatch beer without ceremony just as you pleased. However, she addressed herself to the rite in hand without waiting to clear the matter up. She lay on her back beside the hole and supporting herself on her two elbows bobbed up and down to the drum beats until she got herself into position. Then she lowered her head on to the ground near the hole and lapped some of the beer with her tongue, first on the right side and then on the left. She was followed by the senior banacimbusa and finally by all the helpers in turn. Each had to make a formal obeisance to Nangoshye and to me. It was quite a difficult operation to carry out and each woman who managed to suck up a lot of beer was greeted with shouts of applause and song:

‘I shall not answer you
I shall not answer you, useless creature.’

The two girls themselves then had to drink from the hole with much advice and shouting. The company was by now very much amused and interested, and the rings of beer foam round everyone’s mouth were thought excruciatingly funny.

Finally, there was another rite of ‘honouring the mbusa ’. Nangoshye picked up the pottery emblems and hung beads on them. She offered them ceremonially to the elders in order, singing as a solo this time the precedence song, ‘The arm-pit is not higher than the shoulder.’

The women shouted in congratulation to her. They used one of the old praise songs of the chief:

Mpuba musumba!
Kwewa! Kwewa!

and greeted her with the nick-name that had been given her during the chisungu, ‘Washishye’ ‘You have been refused food’—a reference to the stinginess of the girls’ mothers during the ceremony.

The symbolism of this rite is still obscure to me. The making and distribution of beer is one of the married women’s most important duties and it is natural that this aspect of the girls’ future work should be mimed in the ceremony. Women told me that the rite was to teach the bride to hide a gourd of beer in her hut and to produce it for her husband when the guest had gone. Another added that it was to teach the girls to submit themselves to their husbands ( ukunakila ), the latter perhaps in conjunction with the honouring of the pliant mwenge tree. The association of beer-making with gardens is obvious in the day-to-day speech of the Bemba and the offering of the pottery emblems known as the ‘garden mound’ could be interpreted as making the bride free to cultivate her own garden and hence to brew the resultant beer. The garden-mound also symbolizes the woman owned and ‘cultivated’ by her husband (No. 44).

The preparation of the jumping hoop (mupeto)

The two girls were then sent off with some of the younger helpers to fetch a piece of the mulombwa, or male tree. They came back carrying a branch on their shoulders and they were left to kneel with it thus with down-cast eyes in the humble attitude (see frontispiece) whilst the older women offered the different mbusa to it ritually.

The branch was then stuck in the ground and bent over to form an arch while the mwenge branch was crossed over it at right angles to form a double hoop, known as the mupeto . Everyone was now animated and interested, even though it was about one o’clock and they had had no solid meal during the day. The mulombwa bough was brittle and broke, but the company waited for the best part of an hour for a new one to be found, and they waited in the best of spirits, laughing and talking of this and that. The hoop was apparently to be set up for a trial jump to see if the girls could clear it. This they finally did.

The return of the lion killers

In the meantime, Nangoshye and some helpers had been to look for a heavy log of a third tree—the kabumba —which represents a lion, and was throughout described as the lion. The two girls again knelt holding it on their shoulders, and again the older woman offered the mbusa to it one by one with endless singing, drumming and dancing. Finally, Nangoshye danced up to it brandishing an axe tied round with leaves as was done in the old days when a lion had been killed and purification of the lion-killers took place at a chief’s court. The effect of this solo dance was electrical. The company shouted and danced and broke into the famous song:

Kakoshi sompa! Cilipi! Cilipi!

that used to be sung by lion-killers and also by a man who had had his eyes put out for some offence and was made to come and do obeisance to the chief who had given the order for his punishment.

The return to the village was uproarious. Each of the banacisungu carried one of the hoops of the mupeto with the two ends lashed together to form a hoop. The log lion was balanced and carried on their shoulders. Nangoshye and the older banacimbusa brandished axes and hoes, running and shouting all the way. At the entrance to the village the girls were covered with a black cloth and the rest formed into some sort of a procession. The older women and I were daubed with red dye and castor oil. The oil melted the red powder in the sun and a single spot spread to make a great crimson splash on the side of the face, so that we must have had an uncouth and eerie appearance. In fact, some of the younger girls, mission-trained, began to look embarrassed and to refuse to be daubed in the same way. The women circled the headman’s hut three times singing the lion triumph song over and over again.

The headman’s wife came out to offer the party ground-nuts and various members of the two girls’ families gave some small bracelets and other token gifts. The excitement died down as quickly as it had sprung up. Everyone was tired and hungry and therefore dispirited, and the company melted away.

(The symbolism of this rite is complex. The lion represents the male and therefore the bridegroom. A woman said the honouring of the kabumba tree meant the honouring of the man. Men who kill a lion are congratulated, and rubbed with red dye. They are doctored and sing the lion-killers’ song before the chief to prevent the spirit of the lion ‘coming back’. The blinded man sings the same song to show he harbours no grievance and that his spirit will not ‘come back’. The rite therefore seems to represent the bridegroom who comes as a lion, but there is also implicit the idea of the danger of the chisungu and the association of the red dye with the red blood. The women are congratulated because the danger is over. They circle round the headman’s (chief’s) hut to sing the song of those who have come through danger in triumph.)",1,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual108,"The Planting of the mbusa (ukushimpe mbusa) and the Final Jump
","The planting of the mbusa (ukushimpe mbusa) and the final jump

At about three, the older women went down to the river edge and set up the mupeto, that is to say, the crossed hoops of mwenge and mulombwa . They covered it with clay and stuck it with seeds and red dye. A small round ball of clay, about 4 inches in diameter, was stuck on top so that the whole structure was about 4 feet 5 inches high from the ground. The company assembled by the river bank for the final jump. Both girls cleared the hoop from one direction. They then had to return and make the jump from the other side. This time one of the girls failed twice. It was apparently a terrifying thing to have happened. Her mother looked really angry and distressed and beat her on the legs with a branch. She herself looked petrified with fear and had obviously lost her nerve. Everyone shouted advice, ‘You lazy girl, you!’ ‘Look in the air, don’t look at the mupeto .’ ‘You are going to bring shame on us.’ ‘Jump, you just jump.’ The girl was by this time sobbing miserably, but with a final whack on her shins from her mother, she made a supreme effort and cleared the jump. The relief of the crowd was tremendous. Ululation broke out. Both girls were lifted on their mothers’ backs with cries of triumph. The nacimbusa had to crawl under the hoop and the girls themselves were pushed under the hoop, first in one direction and then in the other. One of the girls’ mothers gave a bracelet to hang on the mupeto, and then the two candidates uprooted the whole structure and carried it off to the river and threw it in. The scene was very animated. There was a hot discussion as to who should carry the girls, the maternal grandmother or the paternal. When this was settled the candidates were finally carried into the village.

(The jumping of the mupeto was described as a rite to make the girls grow ( ukubakushya ).)

The making of the lion

The helpers got no rest, but went immediately to the initiation hut where they started more potting work. The drums were going all the time, but everyone was tired. One young girl escaped to try and eat something, but was rebuked as being very insubordinate. Some of the older people managed to slip away.

The women worked hard at making a lion out of the log of kabumba which had been brought in from the bush. It was set up on four forked sticks and a most life-like head was then modelled in clay at one end, with the mouth reddened with nkula, and teeth made of pumpkin seeds. The clay head was then covered with grass arranged to look like hair, and the feet studded with beans. The whole effect was most impressive. It was by far the most realistic image that had been made.

Then the roof of the shelter made the previous day was used to make a new shelter against the wall, and again new beans were stuck up the supports of the shelter. The work went on at the utmost speed until about five o’clock when most of the women melted away and the nacimbusa was left by herself to repaint all the small pottery emblems for the final rite.

Ritual109,Rites of the Last Night,"Rites of the Last Night

The blind bridegroom

We were called to the initiation hut at about eight o’clock in the evening. A big fire was lit on the hearth and water was already bubbling in three great pots ready to pour on the beer when the time came to serve the drink. The heat was already intense. Some twenty or thirty women were crowded on the floor of the hut with a small open space for dancing kept clear in the centre. Everyone seemed exhausted, with nerves on edge and a tendency to quarrel at the slightest provocation. But there was also a feeling of excitement in the air and I sensed that the climax of the ceremony had come.  Drums and singing went on right through the night into the early morning and accompanied every rite. Each of the songs I have mentioned was sung over and over again, so that there was rarely a moment of silence. The drums were played in relays, the younger women taking it in turns to play them.

The evening started with the entry of the mock bridegrooms once again. They came in shading their eyes and feeling along the edge of the door and the roof of the hut with their hands. They sang:

‘I am groping about in the dark
I am ill.’ (No. 30)

The company burst out laughing. ‘There they come, the blind men! The bridegrooms have come.’

(Women explained to me that the female bridegrooms were pretending that they were blind and could not see the mbusa that were to be shown the girls. ‘It is because they have come to the house where the work has gone on.’)

Swinging over the roof

The two girls were then lifted up and made to hang with their hands from rafters in the roof with their knees pulled up under their chins. They were swung to and fro so that they just cleared the ‘shelter’ with their buttocks. This would be a considerable gymnastic achievement for an ordinary English girl, but was evidently not thought difficult by Bemba girls with arm muscles developed by much grinding and pounding of food. The mock bridegrooms then repeated the performance and the rite was followed by a dance of respect to the older women by the father of one of the girls who came springing with a sort of chassis step into the hut, danced to acclamation and then disappeared as suddenly as he had come.

(The symbolism was again complicated and not described coherently by any of the women. I was told that this was the ceremony of ‘the father of the roof’ ( shintembo ). It meant that the bridegroom and bride were now to look after their relatives by marriage with kindness, i.e. not because of legal duty.

The triumph of the nacimbusa

Nangoshye then pushed her way into the dancing space and mimed a tired woman who yawned and stretched, but could find no place to sleep. A mock bridegroom ceremonially presented her with a sleeping mat and she lay down on it singing over and over again:

‘Let us all lie down and sleep.’

Then the ‘bridegroom’ gave her a length of cloth and she wrapped herself in it singing:

‘Spread the mat
So that we may sleep
The banacisungu say
You have wrapped us in cloth.’ (No. 31)

(Women whispered that the bridegroom was paying the nacimbusa to hand over the secret things to the bride. The nacimbusa, in her turn, tells the bride that she must accept her husband, ( ukusumina umwaume ).) 

Nangoshye then went out of the hut and returned with the big baskets filled with the pottery models that had been made with so much labour for the rite. She stood triumphant at the door with the pottery helmet known as the ‘plumed head-dress’ ( ngala ) on her head. A piece of bark-cloth was wrapped round her waist. The severe and rather domineering woman stood tense and excited at the doorway of the hut. Her great moment had come. She sang:

‘The skin of the lion is worn
At the court of Mwamba.’ (No. 32)

(The messenger of Mwamba (musolo) used to be clothed in lion skin in the old days. The nacimbusa is honoured as the messenger of a great chief. She is dressed in bark-cloth since this was the payment made to a nacimbusa at the end of a chisungu ceremony in the old days.)

The presentation of the mbusa . The pottery models were then pulled forward and the long rite of the giving of the mbusa began.

Each model has its associated song and the meanings of these songs are given in Appendix B. Each song was sung first by Nangoshye, then by some of the older women in turn, and then by each of the two girls. Each had its appropriate action to accompany the words. Some mbusa were merely offered ceremonially to different individuals present; others were handled with mimes suited to the associated song.

On the night in question forty-three different mbusa were presented to the girls. I have given interpretations for thirty in Appendix B and drawings of eighteen are given there. Here I try to group them somewhat arbitrarily under different headings. As each emblem may have several meanings this grouping is inevitably rather an artificial one.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual110,The Cocks of the Dawn,"Eighteenth Day The Cocks of the Dawn (nkoko ya ncela)

I was called just after 4 a.m. The first cock had crowed. It was the signal for the final rite of the killing of the chickens. The two birds were tied up with their heads held on the ground. The drums were beating urgently and the two girls were jogging up and down to time, sitting and rising, sitting and rising, banging the heads of the chickens each time. This is considered an important rite. ‘Why, if she can’t kill the chicken we shall know that she isn’t grown up yet. We shall call her a citongo (an uninitiated person).’ It takes a long time to kill birds this way.

After their heads and necks had been bruised and the fluttering ceased, the birds had to be plucked by the girls and scorched and then put to stew in water after the ordinary Bemba fashion of cooking chicken.

By now every cock in the village was crowing lustily and the women poured out of the hot smoky hut in to the bitter morning air of the cold season of the year. Everyone was drunk. Everyone was happy. Uncouth figures staggered round the village, like some satyr rout, laughing and singing:

‘ Mr. Cock
When you come, have gone,
Let us come and play .’ (No. 36)

The words had a catchy tune, and the drum beat went at the rear of the laughing crowd. A few men came to their hut doors blinking sleepily. They looked on acidly as people do when they have been woken from their beds by other people’s merriment. At last the noise died down and only the oldest of the banacimbusa still ran round the village gardens alone singing in a cracked, drunken voice:

‘ You have slept with the chisungu child,
You have slept with the lion .’ (No. 37)

The communal eating of the chickens

At about eleven, we were called again to the initiation hut. A big pot of porridge was being made to be eaten with the ceremonial chickens. The paternal grandmother of one of the girls was in charge. She pretended to hand a spoon of porridge to each and then took it back. Then came the common Bemba rite known as ukulishya by which those who have undergone a ceremony or kept taboos are made free to eat again with the rest of the community. Such people cannot touch food with their hands. They must be made free to do so. In this case, Nangoshye touched the girls’ lips with the porridge and then made a big ball of it which each had to swallow whole. They were now free to eat with other people and join the ordinary life of the community again.

The porridge was then divided into three portions for the elders, the children and for the banacimbusa . Nangoshye carefully kept aside a wing of chicken for each girl and the rest of the stew was divided out as relish for the 25 or 30 women present.

The bathing of the girls

The two girls were then taken down to the river to be ceremonially bathed—another rite which follows most Bemba ceremonies. A little beer must still have been hidden away in the village for some of the older women seemed happily drunk. They did intoxicated solo dances in the mud on the water’s edge singing:

‘We have gone to fill the pot.’

They put grass bracelets round the girls’ arms saying that they were an earnest of the many things their husbands would give them later.",1,0,0,0,0,1

Ritual112,The Blessing of Objects,"The blessing of the objects used . 

Besides the initial prayers at the different ceremonies the chief object to be used in the subsequent economic activity, such as the axe for the tree-cutting or the seeds for the sowing, must be blessed. This is achieved by bringing it in contact with the magic power of sex. The axe or the seeds are given potency by being placed at the head of the bed ( ku mutwe ) on which the officiating priest and his head wife have intercourse on the night before the rite takes place. The magic effects of such an act are difficult to explain without a full analysis of the Bemba ideas on sex, procreation, and their contagious effects on fire, sacred objects, and on certain human beings. Suffice it to say that the sexual act is thought to make the body hot ( umubili uakava ) and ‘bad’ ( ukuba ne fibi ), and that the individual is then thought unfit to approach the ancestral spirits or to have contact with any sacred object such as the chiefs’ relics, unless he has been ritually purified. But, nevertheless, an act of intercourse between a man and his head wife, followed by this special purification, is the means by which magic potency is conferred on the object placed at the head of the bed, and in some inexplicable way the blessing of the imipashi themselves is thereby invoked. Natives, who were usually shy in discussing the magic aspects of sex, would give in explanation some such phrase as ‘Ni kufunge mipashi’ (‘It is to soften or propitiate the spirits’), and one added that the reason why the chief had such power of blessing the axe or seeds was ‘because of his chieftainship’ ( ubufumu, the abstract principle of chieftainship). And of the object blessed, another informant stated that new qualities had been conferred on it ‘on account of the chieftainship, because the chief lies on top of it’ ( umulandu ua bufumu ico mfumu ilelalapo ). The whole of this conception must be considered against the background of the people’s belief in the supernatural powers of their chiefs, and the influence of his sexual capacities on the fertility of the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual113,Rite of Purification,"The purification of the priest.

Since sex intercourse makes it impossible to approach the imipashi or to enter their shrines, the ritual purification of the officiating priest and his wife, after the blessing of the axe or seeds, is an essential act in each economic rite. It is one which is performed before every solemn prayer or sacrifice to the imipashi, before the founding of a new village, an inheritance ceremony, a death or the birth of twins, &c., either by the chief, the headman, or the commoner, as the case may be. In the case of a commoner or an ordinary headman, this rite of purification ( ukuwamya umubili ) is simple. The morning after the sexual act, the couple set on the fire the woman’s marriage pot—a tiny clay pot made for her by her paternal aunt on her marriage—and they heat water in it. This the wife then pours over her husband’s hands. Both then bathe in the river and return to the village, after which new fire must be lighted in the hut. Sex taboos are kept by the pair until the ceremony in question is over. In the case of the chief, and particularly the Citimukulu, this rite is, however, exceedingly complex. It involves the simultaneous ritual intercourse of the chief and the ‘wife of the land’ ( umukolo ua calo ), and the Cimba and the Cikutwe with their respective head wives in huts built specially for the purpose. Afterwards twelve or fifteen of the bakabilo must assist, each with his own hereditary part, in the purification ceremony and the lighting of the new fire. Without purifying his body the chief can never enter his benye house or use his powers over the land to the full, but the complication and expense of a rite which requires the simultaneous presence of so many officials is one of the reasons why the full ceremonial of tree-cutting or first-fruits described later is so rarely performed nowadays, when chiefs are impoverished and cannot always command the loyalty of their bakabilo .",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ritual119,Co-su-kong Festival,"Within the Circle of Bamboo

At this point , having had a look at the four lineages in their settlements, we might usefully discuss the relationship of the four settlements to one another. I have said that they occupy a common territory, conceived as such by the residents, and that during their early history they were closely allied. But have these early ties fallen away over the years, leaving the four settlements isolated units, like villages? Or have they remained associated, so that the li is neither one village nor four villages, but rather four groups more closely connected than four villages yet less bound together than four parts of the same village? In fact, the four parts of Ch'inan cohere as a social unit in an unusual way, as discussion of the rotating pai-pais and earth-god temples will disclose.

In discussing the rotation of pai-pais among the four settlements, what concerns us is not the Ang-kong pai-pai , in which Ch'inan cooperates with Ch'ipei and Ch'itung, but the two pai-pais in which the four settlements alone are involved, those for Co-su-kong and Tho-te-kong. Let us take them in that order. The festival for Co-su-kong is held on the fourth day of the first month. On that day the settlement or lineage in charge must fetch an image of the god from the Sanhsia temple. Once in the settlement, the image is placed in a sedan chair, which is either rented from the temple or borrowed from one of the Ch'inan lineages. A procession forms behind the image, composed of a small band of horn and drum players, usually from the Li settlement, and three men to carry and beat a huge brass gong. In the rear walks the lo-cu and anyone else who is interested. Starting from the lineage hall of the settlement in charge, the procession “beats the bounds,” which is to say, marches along a path that marks the geographical boundaries of the li . Usually, as the procession marches slowly past isolated houses, the residents dash out to pai-pai the god with incense. If they are slow to come, the procession waits; the lo-cu may even go inside to fetch them. When the procession reaches a densely populated cluster of houses, such as the area surrounding a lineage hall, it stops and waits until everyone has had a chance to worship.

In 1970, the Ui lo-cu and the procession he organized toured the li in the following order. Beginning at the Ui ancestral hall, they proceeded to the Lou settlement, then to the Lis', and on to the lower Ong settlement. They next marched up to the farthest house in the upper Ong valley that is considered a part of Ch'inan, then turned around and marched out to the road. From there, they proceeded slowly, waiting for each isolated household on the other side of the highway to send out a representative to pai-pai . Eventually, the procession made full circle and ended at the Ui settlement, where the god's image was placed inside the hall.

The god is said to be touring his realm, overseeing a small part of his domain, during this procession. The territorial unit that he surveys on this occasion corresponds to social boundaries established by the residents of the li . Whereas the earthly authorities sometimes establish governmental divisions on the land that are at odds with socially defined territories, the supernatural authorities are thought to recognize only units that are socially relevant to the residents. Hence, the god was not escorted all the way up the valley behind the Ongs even though the last houses are not far beyond where the procession stopped. According to the government classification, in fact, the farthermost houses belong to Ch'inan li , but they do not belong to it according to where their social interaction occurs. It is Ch'inan seen as a social unit by the residents that is surveyed by the god on his tour.

It is also Ch'inan that the god is beseeched to protect for another year. Each year, only one of the settlements or lineages provides an opera for the god. Yet all the residents regard the person holding the position of lo-cu as their representative before the god. In addition, every resident trusts the lo-cu to dispose of funds honestly and wisely, for the cost of the opera is shared by each household in the li . There is thus a relationship of interdependence among the four settlements for supernatural favor. For three out of four years, each settlement is content to rely on the efforts of another settlement to please the god and obtain his protection for another year. To be sure, residents of settlements that do not have the opera may make their own offerings to the god, but he is thought to be especially pleased by opera performances. Only the first day of opera is financed by the entire li . After that, the settlement in charge is supposed to continue the show by taking up a collection among its residents. Consequently, the other three settlements are at least partly dependent on the willingness of that settlement to please the god with opera. But this fact reacts in turn on the settlement in charge. In 1970, there was much talk among the Uis to the effect that they would be criticized by the rest of the li residents if they failed to provide a good enough show. In this way the four settlements remain tied together by their interdependence in ritual affairs.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Ritual120,The Cutting (Kuaq-tng),"The most fundamental difference between the hall and the grave is that the grave is where the corpse of the dead person is located. Although an ancestor's soul is said to be present sometimes at the hall and sometimes at the grave, his corpse is permanently present only at the grave. By looking at actions and attitudes that apply to the corpse alone, we may come to understand why the grave offerings are so different from those of the hall. The time when people are most directly exposed to the corpse is the short period before the coffining. One ritual that takes place in this period shows clearly the fear and dread people feel toward the corpse. This ritual, called “the cutting” ( kuaq-tng ), is the last rite before the actual transfer of the body to the coffin.

I witnessed this ritual only once, at a coffining in the Li settlement. The body of the deceased, a fifty-five-year-old woman, was lying on a wide board placed on benches outside of the hall. Because she had died in Taipei, several hours had elapsed between the time of her death and the return of the body to the settlement. This made it dangerous to move the corpse into the hall, so it was displayed just outside. By about 10:00 p.m. the Taoist priests had finished their chanting and packed away their instruments. The large crowd milling around were mostly Lis of the first fang , the fang of the deceased woman. Except for the body, which was illuminated by bright, naked electric bulbs, everything was dark. Everyone was busy and seemed to be gripped by a kind of noisy hysteria. Women stood about the body keening and wailing; men and other women dashed about carrying food and objects for the rituals to come. But then the tempo of the action began to increase and the wailing grew louder and louder. Suddenly, order began to emerge out of the confusion around the body. The oldest lady in the lineage moved to stand next to the corpse, weeping, keening, and rocking back and forth. She was followed by the deceased's direct descendants, who lined up next to her. Finally, all the other Lis present, regardless of what fang they belonged to, formed into a long line stretching away from the corpse, down the cement courtyard and into the darkness on the steps leading away from the hall.

At this point, an assistant priest brought out a length of string, which he tied to the wrist of the corpse and fed out so that it passed through the hands of everyone in the line. Next he gave everyone a slip of the mock paper money ordinarily burned at funerals and a stick of incense. Each person folded the paper money and held it in one hand so the string passed through the fold and did not touch his hands. The incense was held with the money. While everyone stood there silently except for several women who continued to wail, a Taoist priest faced the corpse, banging together two cleavers and reciting incantations. After a time he moved down the line of Lis followed by his assistant, and stopping in front of each person, cut the string, leaving everyone holding a separate piece. This they then placed, along with the paper money and incense stick, in a basket held by the priest's assistant. Finally, when all the pieces of string were in the basket, it was taken away from the hall and burned to ashes.

Some informants told me that the string-cutting ritual signifies separation between the living and the dead. “The rope that stretches between the corpse and the living is cut to keep the dead away from his descendants so he will not come back and cause trouble for them later on.” Others said the meaning of the ritual is expressed by the saying “When you week, get out the roots” -- that the intent is to eradicate as completely as possible the connection between the living and the corpse. The corpse is thought to be inherently dangerous; anyone who has come into contact with it will seek ways to prevent further contact in the future. Not only descendants of the deceased, but anyone who cares to, can stand in the line at the coffining and be finally cut off from the corpse. Several Lis told me later that I, too, should have stood in the line.

It is partly the capacity of the corpse to turn into a dangerous and powerful monster, or iau-kuai , that is feared at the coffining. While the corpse is in an indeterminate state between a living man and a buried ancestor it is relatively less predictable and controllable. If insufficient precautions are taken, and the corpse does become a monster, it will harm anyone it meets; hence anyone present at the offining, descendant or not, may receive ritual protection against the corpse. Many of my informants had heard stories of corpses that were not protected as they should have been. The most common incident was said to have occurred in a neighboring town, where for some reason the burial of a dead man had been delayed for more than a year. His relatives had built a shed next to the house to cover the coffin but had left chinks in the roof so that the sun and moon were able to shine on it. Because of this the corpse was able to turn into a iau-kuai with long white hair, huge fangs, and a long tongue. The dead man's soul was able to leave the corpse and cause sickness and other troubles for the people in the area.

The continued presence of the corpse in the grave may well account for the difference in food offerings there. Although the corpse is less liable to escape its normal form when it is safely buried, as we shall see, it is still capable of autonomous changes that threaten those around it. The aura surrounding the ancestor in the hall is that of the known and familiar; descendants often prepare special dishes that were favorites of the deceased. But at the grave, 12 fairly standard dry substances are offered because “We have to be sure to include something he will like.” The implication is that the descendants do not know which foods the ancestor as buried corpse will eat. Nor can they explain how he is able to consume dry, uncooked food.

The fact that the hall can only be occupied by those who have a right to be there, namely, ancestors, also helps to explain the difference in food offerings at the two sites and the sense of uncertainty about the ancestor in the grave. Unlike the hall, the grave is a place to which all manner of spirits, including kui (ghosts) who are not ancestors, have access. * “At the hall only the ancestor comes to eat, though he might bring along a friend; it is like the feast that the living have after the offerings. But at the grave there might be flocks of ghosts around trying to eat the offerings we make to our ancestor.” Accordingly, many of the activities at the grave are directed against any uninvited ghosts who might be on hand. To ensure that the ancestor receives the offerings made to him, for example, the smoldering ashes of the paper money burnt for him are doused with a cup of wine to “mark” this and all the rest of the offerings as his alone and to prevent other ghosts from taking them. The living who are present also need to be protected. The most common measure taken to this end is to pass out red steamed cakes to everyone who comes to the grave, the red color acting as a prophylactic to ward off any danger from lingering contact with ghosts. Another common precaution is to warn children against urinating anywhere near a grave. Everyone knew what had befallen one small boy who had urinated at a grave near Ch'inan. A ghost who happened to be at that spot had thereupon followed the boy home and had plagued him with illness until the child was exorcised of his tormentor by a god.

In sum, the grave, located outside of the settlement, is very different from the hall in that access to it cannot be controlled; it is freely haunted by the souls of the dead. These dead persons, like the ancestor buried there, are living but are no longer part of the familiar, observable iong world. When someone visits the grave he is exposing himself to one of the gates of the im world and must deal with dangerous ghosts on their terms. In contrast, when the souls of the ancestors visit the hall they rejoin the iong world; living people can relate to them as known, familiar ascendants. This difference, which begins to make the contrast between edible food offered in the hall and inedible substances offered at the grave intelligible, only partially describes the character of the ancestor in the grave. To describe it more fully, we must turn to the ways the ancestor in the grave continues to interact with the living long after his burial is over.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual120,The Cutting (Kuaq-tng),"Until the encoffining Thuan's body rested before his ancestral altar, covered by a sheet, and silver paper was burnt continuously to light the way for his soul on its journey to the spirit world, or im-kan . During this time, a priest came from San-hsia and erected a paper ancestral tablet where Thuan's spirit would also reside until a permanent wooden tablet was made two years later. Food and changes of clothing were placed at the feet of the body morning and evening until the burial.

Four young village men brought the coffin from San-hsia in a two-wheeled pull-cart on the evening of the 29th. After depositing it in Thuan's house they washed their hands carefully; even an empty coffin is dirty because of its contact with death. Early the next morning, as the body was encoffined, a priest from town ritually cut Thuan off from contact with the living: he tied one end of a string around a hand of the corpse and asked all the relatives and friends who were helping out to stand in line with the string in their hands; then he cut the string between each pair of hands. After this the lid was sealed on the coffin, which would rest in the house until the next morning.

For some funerals the kong-tik , or merit-making rituals, last all day, but Thuan's family was poor and decided on a shorter version. So when I arrived in front of Thuan's house early the next morning, I found very little activity: a few people were coming and going, and the strident wailing of Thuan's two sons and his female relatives could be heard behind the closed doors of his house. Despite the injunction that the coffin be taken out of the house between 5 and 7, it was still inside. Moving it slightly during that period was sufficient compliance; it would be taken out later when there were more men around to help.

The early part of the morning was taken by practical concerns -- a feast had to be prepared, albeit a rather simple one, so anyone from the village with spare time stopped by and helped with preparation of food and tableware. Female relatives and neighbors sewed mourning costumes in Thuan's youngest brother's house, pausing occasionally to beg Thuan's aged mother to stop wailing over the coffin and come back to her youngest son's house and rest. Each time she rested for a short time, but eventually went back to wail again. The loud, almost melodious wailing is a required part of the ritual for some mourners, and when an old person dies at the end of a full life, it is often merely perfunctory. But for someone like Thuan who died in what should have been the prime of life, the grief is real and so are the tears.

Five priests arrived around 10 o'clock and began preparing for the merit-making rituals. They hung stylized portraits of Buddhist deities not ordinarily worshipped by villagers in a house next to Thuan's, along with scrolls graphically representing the tortures and punishments of the ten courts of judgment the dead man's soul would have to pass through on its way to a permanent resting place. The primary purpose of the priests' ritual was to expedite the soul through these courts, and to this end they made two white pennants, one expressing the wish that Thuan's soul reach the Western Paradise as quickly as possible, and the other expressing similar wishes for Thuan's long-dead father and for a son who died in infancy. In the popular view the meritmaking ceremonies also serve to provide a comfortable life for the spirit in the afterworld, so people often have a second ceremony performed for a previously deceased relative when they are having a funeral anyway.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual121,Trip to Underworld by Tang-ki,"Talk of a trip to the underworld usually began whenever the tang-ki arrived. But before he would arrange a trip he made sure there was sufficient interest among the Ongs. For each inquiry directed to a resident of the underworld he charged NT $10, and he told me it was not worth the trouble unless he could earn over NT $100 an evening. To ensure that sum he needed at least five or six people who would agree to ask questions. In addition, he needed the services of Ong Bieng-tiek, a young man who acted as his informal assistant.

Since this practice has not been adequately described in the literature, I shall go into considerable detail on one trip I saw while in Ch'inan. On this occasion, as on most, Ong Bieng-tiek circulated through the settlement at dusk after people had finished eating dinner, announcing that a trip to the underworld would be starting soon. On the way he stopped at the small local store to buy several packs of paper money and incense. Meanwhile, the tang-ki made his ritual preparations in a small house on the outskirts of the settlement, which the residents had vacated for the evening. First, he arranged bowls of fruit and candy on a table to serve as offerings to whichever god came to lead people to the underworld. This done, he wrote out several name and address forms, leaving blank spaces for a name and house number but filling in “Ong settlement, Ch'inan Li, Sanhsia Chen, Taipei Hsien” on each. These he would complete later when he learned which relatives the participants wished to contact. A few early arrivals stood around chatting as they folded paper money in half or rolled it into funnels for easy burning.

After a while, when about ten adults and twice as many children had arrived, the tang-ki announced that only those who wished to attempt to go to the underworld could have their feet on the floor. All but four of those present scrambled up on one of the two platform beds in the room while the would-be travelers, two middle-aged men, a young man, and a young woman, took seats on tall stools alongside the offering table. The atmosphere was excited, very like the feeling at the start of an excursion: children giggled and shrieked at each other, adults chattered loudly. When the four candidates for the trip were seated, perched straight-backed on the stools, blindfolded and hands resting on their knees, Ong Bieng-tiek, the tang-ki 's assistant, began to beat a wooden clapper loudly and steadily on the table, making a strident, piercing “Clap, clap, clap.” The tang-ki lit incense and offered it, facing out the open door. Then returning to the center of the room, he chanted the names of several gods (among them Co-su-kong), burned several slips of paper with these names written on them, and placed the ashes in a small bowl of water, attempting to entreat some god to come and possess the body of one of the candidates in order to lead him to the underworld. Although everyone was sure that a god's presence was necessary for the trip, it actually seemed to be of little account. The tang-ki chanted the gods' names frequently during the first part of the session and kept people away from the open door so the gods could enter, but after one of the candidates had entered a trance, it was taken that he had been possessed by a god, and nothing more was mentioned on the subject. The man in the trance was treated not like a god but like himself; he was ordered to go or not to go to various places at the will of the tang-ki .

While the clapper beat continuously, the tang-ki repeated the names of the gods and burned incense and paper money under the noses of the four candidates. Occasionally, he would sprinkle them with water from the bowl in which he had placed the ashes of paper with the gods' names written on them, stamping his foot and shouting “Go! Go!” After about an hour of this treatment, three of the four were shaking periodically but were jerking “awake” in between spells. The fourth, the young woman, an Ong daughter-in-law, got up, declaring that she was giving up because it was too uncomfortable sitting on the stool. Now the tang-ki concentrated all his attention on one of the middle-aged men, Ong Kim-ci:, filling the air around his head with smoke, shouting at him to “Go!” and feeling his hands to see if they were cold. (The tang-ki explained later that he could always tell when someone was beginning the trip because his hands would grow icy cold.) Kim-ci: responded to the extra attention and began to shake more and more steadily, his hands lightly patting his knees. Finally, he said quietly, in a low voice, “There's no road.” At that everyone knew he had entered the underworld; the other men were shaken awake so they could watch the proceedings.

The next series of events were concerned with helping the traveler over the hurdles at the entrance to the underworld, much as the kong-tiek is designed to help the deceased find his way there. When Kim-ci: repeated that he could not find the road, the tang-ki decided that the problem must be Tho-te-kong, wanting money. Accordingly, he began to burn paper money on the floor in front of Kim-ci:. “No, no,” said Kim-ci:. “He won't let me through. The people here won't put down the bridge and let me over.” The tang-ki kept on burning money, saying that it was perfectly good money, and that Kim-ci: should just go on across the bridge. “No,” Kim-ci: repeated. “They won't let me over. They say to find another road.” “All right,” replied the tang-ki , “find another one, but hurry up.”

Once Kim-ci: was on the move again, he began to shake more vigorously. His feet jogged up and down, and his head moved slowly from side to side as if he were looking for something. His travels were punctuated by frequent remarks, such as “No road at all” and “Have to climb these mountains.” Finally, he found another bridge, and after the tang-ki burned some money, the black-faced man who guarded it allowed Kim-ci: to cross. Still, his adventures were far from finished. He described himself as climbing laboriously up mountains without end. When he said he saw horses, the tang-ki urged him to mount one so as to make better speed. “No,” Kim-ci: said. “They won't let me get on.” Soon after, he said that he saw Tho-te-kong. “Ask him if you have arrived yet,” said the tang-ki . “He says I'm not there yet,” replied Kim-ci:. Then, seeing terrible animals with the heads of horses or pigs and the bodies of other animals, he said urgently, “I'm frightened; I don't want to go on.” The tang-ki tried to reassure him and urged him to continue. “How can it be so far?” Kim-ci: asked. “I've been walking so far, and I'm not there yet.” At this, one of the other men asked if he saw any cars he could ride in. In response, Kim-ci: stopped jogging his feet and moved his head around and around, looking, but he was unable to find a car. Eventually, after more walking and looking, he said he could see some houses ahead. This seemed to be a cue for everyone in the room to relax: Kim-ci: was out of the wild, mountainous border zone between the iong and im worlds, and had arrived at a different, but ordered, place.

According to the tang-ki , the underworld is organized into ten kingdoms or palaces, each ruled by one of the officials of the underworld. Each kingdom is a replica of the iong world, containing the same cities, towns, and villages in the same relationship to each other as in the iong world. After judgment, each person is sent to one of the kingdoms, depending on the date of his birth and hence the animal sign under which he was born. Most of the villagers have a simpler picture. For them, there is only one kingdom, which is a complete replica of the iong world. When people die they go to live in the area of the underworld that corresponds to the iong -world town or village they lived in. This disparity of views accounts for some of the confusion in the rest of Ong Kim-ci:'s narration of his trip through the underworld.

As soon as Kim-ci: said he could see houses ahead, the tang-ki took up one of the address forms he had made and filled in the name and house number of one of the relatives Kim-ci: wanted to visit. Burning the paper, he then instructed Kim-ci: to travel to the second kingdom. Kim-ci: obediently walked on awhile, then cried out that he saw his grandfather off in the distance. “He's too far away, he doesn't see me. Why won't my grandfather turn and look at me?” The tang-ki told him to call out to his grandfather, but Kim-ci: just kept repeating that his grandfather did not see him. “Grandfather does have a house, though, and it looks fine,” he added.

At this point, one of the onlookers told the tang-ki he wanted to contact his mother, who, I learned later, had hanged herself at the age of forty-nine. The tang-ki consulted a book to see what kingdom the woman should be in, then sent the traveler there. Shortly, Kim-ci: announced that he could see the woman he was seeking, together with her father-in-law. The tang-ki consulted his book again to see whether or not both should be in the same kingdom. According to his calculations they should not have been, but Kim-ci: was not deterred. He went on trying to talk to the woman, who ignored him or did not realize he was there.

Walking on a bit, Kim-ci: said he could see his elder brother sleeping in bed. Throughout the following episode, Kim-ci: leaned forward, his head stretched out and inclined to one side, just as if he were scrutinizing the face of a sleeping person. He spoke to his brother, calling out, “Elder brother! Elder brother!,” but received no response. The tang-ki burned money to encourage him to answer. Soon Kim-ci: reported that his brother had received the money and had placed it on his bed, but still showed no sign of recognition. He only covered his eyes with his arm and lay there smiling. The tang-ki burned more money and told Kim-ci: to call his brother again. But Kim-ci: reported, “He is getting out of bed and going away.” Burying his face in his hands, Kim-ci: began to cry, saying, “My brother won't talk to me. My own brother won't talk to me.” After a few minutes of sobbing, he raised his head and looked around, commenting that his brother's house looked fine and was staffed with two servants. Trying to divert him from the loss of his brother, the tang-ki asked him who lived next door. Kim-ci: looked over that way and said, “I thought I knew who that was, but he turned his back on me before I could see. What is the use of my coming here if no one will talk to me? I'm going home.”

The tang-ki suggested that Kim-ci: travel around a bit more, but he was adamant about wanting to return. The trip back was not as difficult as the arrival. The tang-ki simply read an incantation from a sheet of paper, ending with the command, “Come back! Come back!” And several people called out Kim-ci:'s name. He slowly stopped shaking and became still. In a few minutes, he removed his blindfold and dazedly wiped the tears from his eyes. He apparently remembered what had happened because he kept repeating that his brother would not talk to him. The experience must have been exhausting, for he promptly went to one of the beds, and making room for himself, stretched out and fell asleep.

No sooner had Kim-ci: stepped down from his stool than Ong Bieng-tiek, the tang-ki 's assistant, took it, saying he wanted to go for a tour of the underworld. This young man, as always, went into a trance very quickly, after about ten minutes of clapper-beating and chanting by the tang-ki , and then crossed the border of the im world in a few minutes. The tang-ki at once sent him to see the garden of the underworld. There he described the flowers, their marvelous shapes and unusual colors and scents. The onlookers questioned him freely, often laughing at his responses. Next directed to one of the prisons where wrong-doers are punished, he reported seeing a man being crushed in a rice-grinder, his blood flowing out in a constant stream. After describing another man, who was tied to a red-hot iron pillar, Bieng-tiek turned away in disgust.

Here let me interrupt briefly to say that every person in the iong world is believed to have a house in the underworld, which along with its garden and the tree growing there, represents him or her in the im world. In the case of women the tree in the garden is a flowering one. On trips to the underworld, people often request the traveler to visit their houses and trees, hoping that the condition of one or the other may be the cause of some trouble in the iong world, and that they can arrange to have the problem fixed so the iong world will right itself.

To resume my narrative, the tang-ki , allowing that young Biengtiek had seen enough torture, now instructed him to go to the second kingdom and see his tree. When he arrived there, he reported that the kitchen was very dirty, and that, moreover, the roots of his tree were sickly, and one of its branches had been eaten away by bugs. Hearing this, the tang-ki burned a packet of paper money, telling Bieng-tiek to hire some workmen to come clean the house where it was dirty and fix the tree where it was damaged. As we shall see later, the condition of the tree and the house usually reflects the physical condition of the person they represent.

After Bieng-tiek had arranged for his tree to be repaired, he set off on his own to “tour around.” On the way he saw many paddy fields, which like those in the iong world were ready for planting. He also saw shops selling noodles, fruit, and medicine, much like a street scene in any small town. As soon as he began to describe a group of girls walking along the street, the tang-ki began to read an incantation that brought the young man back into the iong world. The tang-ki said later that if Bieng-tiek had been attracted to one of the girls, he might have refused to leave the underworld, remaining there forever. On other occasions, Bieng-tiek has stayed in the underworld longer, touring more extensively and describing such things as motion-picture theaters and houses of prostitution. In most cases, his descriptions prompted both great hilarity and great amazement: hilarity at his youthful enjoyment of girls and movies, and amazement at how similar the underworld is to the iong world.

It is plain that there is a very different emphasis when the dead are contacted in the underworld as compared with the hall or the grave. There, they are not sought out just because they are ascendants or because they left property behind; nor are they regarded as dangerously powerful creatures, as at the grave. Descendants are under no avowed obligation to visit their ancestors regularly in the underworld; when they have a chance to do so, they tend to seek out those they remember especially vividly or with whom they have some special business. By far the most frequently met relatives are the parents, who are usually the most recently dead relatives and probably the most clearly remembered. Kim-ci:'s contact with his grandfather was the only instance I know of in which an ancestor in the second ascending generation was seen in the underworld.

The second most frequently met people in the underworld share the characteristic of having died prematurely under unusual circumstances. Often people who die young do not receive the full complement of rites for the dead; they will be buried properly, but the large expenditure involved in the kong-tiek may not be made for them. Perhaps because these omissions directly affect their comfort in the underworld, their relatives worry about the conditions they are living under there. Sometimes this worry extends beyond the immediate relatives: a visitor will announce that he sees a person who has died prematurely or violently even though the close relatives have not asked him to seek that person out. For example, one time a traveler in the underworld said he could see a group of young men who had been killed in a coal mine accident. They refused to talk to him because they were naked, having no clothes to wear. Finally, they agreed to answer his questions if he would turn his back. The rest of the report described the dreadful conditions under which the men had to live out their time in the underworld. In another case, the traveler spotted a woman who had died at thirty years of age. In dying so young she was considered to have committed an unfilial act, and in consequence, even though she had borne children for her husband's family, they refused to burn a paper house for her. According to the traveler, she had no house to live in, and having been given no money to spend, had to engage in hard labor to earn enough to buy food.

The living also seem preoccupied with those among the dead whose dreams or lives were unfulfilled at death. The best example of this involves a girl who died at age eighteen, before marriage. Virtually every time a trip was made to the underworld in the Ong settlement, her relatives would try to communicate with her. When sickness in the family was attributed to the girl's desire to be married posthumously, several attempts were made to determine her choice of a marriage partner. One time, she was asked if she still wanted a marriage arranged. After she replied affirmatively, her sister-in-law asked her whom she wanted to marry. She replied that it was a Li man who had died at the age of twenty-six. Although they plied her with further questions about who the man was, she would reply only that he would somehow identify himself. When I left the village, negotiations were still going on over the girl's marriage.

What of the dead whose personalities are no longer distinctly remembered? The answer seems to be that they are neither seen nor visited in the underworld. For one thing, as the memory of an individual fades, he ceases to exist in the underworld for the living; and for another, as time passes, a dead person moves closer and closer to the point when he will leave the underworld by means of reincarnation. That the dimly remembered dead cease to be visited in the underworld and that rebirth takes place from the underworld is an entirely appropriate conjunction. Regarded in this way, the apparent inconsistency between the concept of the reincarnation of the dead into another personality or form of life and the concept of their continued existence on ancestral altars and in their graves is lessened. The ancestors live on in the underworld as intimately remembered loved ones. When that facet of their existence is lost, they disappear from the underworld both by reincarnation and by relegation to oblivion. This disappearance does not conflict with their continued worship at altars and graves, for, as we have discussed, other aspects of the ancestors' personalities are reflected in those places.

Now that we have traveled to the underworld, so to speak, we are in a better position to relate that world to the wider world view of the Taiwanese. As we have seen, the im world is not conceived as a direct opposite of the everyday iong world. Indeed, quite the contrary, the two worlds are precisely alike in many ways: the crops are planted at the same time, and the stores and houses in the im world are replicas of their iong counterparts. Moreover, even the aspects of the underworld that are different, such as the places of punishment for wrongs committed during life, are but extensions of iong institutions, in this case, earthly courts of law. To understand how the two worlds complement each other, let us take a closer look at the im house and its tree as representations of the bodies of living men and women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual122,Am-hang,"One event that seems quintessentially Lukang is am-hang , a nocturnal procession of deities, mostly Ong Ia, for the purpose of expelling malign influences from an area. It is an occasional rite that can be performed at any time and for any area, but every spring there is an am-hang for the entire city of Lukang. After dark a procession of perhaps fifteen sedan chairs, led by those of T'u Ti Kung and the Ch'eng Huang, passes along every street and alley in the city. It takes all night to cover the route. The procession winds through the city in near silence and near total darkness, the only light coming from a few dim electric bulbs on the gods' chairs and from glowing incense sticks. Householders, usually in their night clothes, stand in their doorways with incense sticks and pai (bow slightly with the hands together, the gesture of respect and supplication to the gods) as the chairs pass. They receive charm papers, hu , from the men who accompany the procession.

Most religious processions in Taiwan are, by definition, lau-ziat (Mandarin je-nao )--that is, exciting, gay, crowded, offering maximum stimulation to all the senses. Religious festivals and processions are often referred to simply as “lau-ziat.” Am-hang in Lukang is not lau-ziat; it is spooky. There are no bands, no floats, no costumed troupes of performers, none of the great puppets one sees in processions in northern Taiwan. The participants are mostly young men in their regular clothes, who take turns carrying the sedan chairs through the silent streets at a trot. There are no tang-ki, and chairbearers are not expected to go into trance. (One I observed who showed signs of possession was immediately replaced and left behind by the rest of his group.) All the deities are from temples in Lukang; there are none from any other place. No one watches the procession; indeed it is hard to see anything but lurching points of light. No feast is associated with the am-hang, and it is certainly not an event one invites guests to. There is an intense but somewhat hurried and furtive atmosphere about the whole event. As far as I know, this silent, distinctly eerie procession through the sleeping streets is the only ritual event that includes every household in the city of Lukang. Whatever else it is about, it is clearly concerned with territory and locality, and every household, rich or poor, is “served” equally and in an order determined only by its location. The procession, in an understated way, defines the limits of the city and deals with the inhabitants in terms of their most basic and common status, that of city resident. No one has very much to say about the procession, and people do not discuss it as they do Ma Tsu's birthday, the festival for the hungry ghosts in the seventh month, or the dedication of a new temple. “That's amhang. It's an old Lukang custom.”",0,0,0,0,1,1
Ritual123,Great Communal Sacrifice (ta-chiao),"Memorial for a Collective Service

The memorial for a collective service I have chosen as an example was used at a chiao held in 1969, in the village of A-lien in the north of Kao-hsiung hsien. A-lien Village is the administrative center of the similarly named canton. At the turn of the century it became an important sugar-growing area, and much of its relative commercial and administrative importance dates from that time. The village now comprises three hamlets, Ch'ing-lien, Ho-lien, and A-lien, the first two names being derived from that of the village temple, the Ch'ing-ho Kung. The entire agglomeration has about 5,000 inhabitants, according to the census of 1959. Since the end of the war, the three hamlets have collaborated in a Great Communal Sacrifice, ta-chiao , every twelve years. Participation of the villagers is near unanimous, with almost 80 percent of them contributing financially to this festival.

A collective memorial such as the one used for A-lien's Great Sacrifice is written in bold k'ai-shu on a long piece of high-quality red paper. After the memorial is written, the paper is folded like an accordion, the folds being about three inches apart, and the title of the document is written in large characters on the outer fold. This is the main memorial. As is customary, the A-lien memorial had several annexes, executed on paper of the same size and folded in the same way, which bore names of all the faithful, sin-su , i.e., those who had helped finance the festival. The A-lien memorial had three such appendixes, one for each hamlet. The text of the collective memorial, including all the annexes, is copied a second time on a far larger sheet of red paper, one more than three feet high and several yards long. This is the pang or placard, posted at the start of the ceremonies on the outer wall of the village temple for everyone to see. The placard is usually written in the special style known as ta-tzu , which was used for official announcements by the Ch'ing dynasty.

The following is a somewhat condensed version of the main memorial. I have numbered the sections into which the original document is divided in order to facilitate reference to my commentary, which follows the translation.

1. Blessed Memorial of the Fragrant Sacrifice of the Golden Register for Thanksgiving and Prayer for Peace in the Ch'ing-ho Kung temple at A-lien, the eleventh month of the year chi-yu [1969], the 24th, 25th, and 26th days.

2. The Immortal Grand Official of the Canonical Register of the Orthodox Covenant, Holder and Preacher of the Law of the Divine Empyrean, appointed Prefect of the Boards of Heavenly Medicine, Fate, and Thunder, the humble servant Ch'en Ting-sheng,

3. with sincere fear and apprehension, bowing and knocking his head in a hundred-fold salute, the aforenamed servant humbly presents this memorial on behalf of

4. the population of A-lien, Kao-hsiung hsien, Taiwan province of the Republic of China,

5. having all gathered at the Ch'ing-ho Kung temple to profess their faith in the Tao and prepare a sacrifice in thanksgiving and prayer for peace, to protect the territory and cultivate blessings .

6. [Each of the following titles is preceded by a person's name.] Chief of the Assembly, Chief of the Sacrifice, Chief of the Altar, Chief of the P'u-tu, Head of the Lamp of Heaven; Head of the Lamp of the Three Officials, Head of the Lamp of the Heavenly Master, Head of the Lamp of the Supreme Emperor, Head of the Lamp of Kuan Yin, Head of the Lamp of Prayer for Peace; Assistant Chief of the Assembly, Assembly Coordinator, Assembly Director, Assembly Cantor, Assembly Correspondent [?]; General Manager . [Here, at the reading, may be inserted the names of the faithful, i.e., the family heads whose names appear in the annexes, followed by a count of their sons and daughters. Sons are counted as ting , daughters as k'ou . A name may thus read as follows: Chang Ping-ting, five ting, two k'ou (five sons, two daughters). In the three annexes, there were altogether 780 heads of household listed; I did not count up the children.]

7. All these, together with the masses of believers, respectfully, having bathed and lit incense, venture to do obeisance and communicate that:

8. Heaven is high but hears those who are low, the gods can be stirred to answer those who approach them. Thus the Pole Star did away with the calamity about to befall Chao-tzu, and the [god of the] Ni Mountain answered the prayer of Confucius's father. These proofs of ancient times today give us trust. But, considering that we, residing together in our tree-shaded village, while maintaining the countryside's tradition of benevolence, have experienced in former years great natural calamities, as well as periodic epidemics that contaminated our territory, disturbing the peace of people and animals alike; therefore we have, with utmost sincerity, lit incense, bowed our heads, and invoked Our Divine Benefactor Marshal Hsin, as chief of the population, to act on our behalf and transmit to the High Perfect Beings of the Three Worlds and the High Firmament as well as to the multitude of Divine Saints, the sacrificial vows we have pronounced: That epidemics may disappear and calamities may cease to occur in our region; that auspicious emanations may herald happiness and that felicitous blessings may be diffused in our community; that each family may prosper, man and animal alike may have peace, grains be abundant, cattle multiply. Having indeed moved [Heaven and Saints with our prayers], we now evidently must answer.

9. Through divination we selected the 24th, 25th, and 26th days of this month to devote ourselves to our religion and gather at the temple, erecting an altar in order to celebrate a great communal fragrant sacrifice of the Golden Register for Thanksgiving and Prayer for Peace, the ceremonies lasting for three days and nights, beginning with the sounding of the drum at the propitious hour [here follows a list of all the rites performed during the three days of ceremonies].

10. All this in order to thank the High Perfect Beings above and ask for peace and blessings below.

11. The . . . day of the eleventh month of the cyclical year chi-yu, the humble servant Ch'en Ting-sheng, prostrated, salutes and with humility presents this memorial .

1. Collective services for the benefit of the living are now called sacrifices of the Golden Register, Chin-lu-chiao , whereas services for the dead are called retreats of the Yellow Register, Huang-lu-chai . This distinction, which has developed since the Sung dynasty, is a rather artificial one. It reflects the association of funeral with mortification and of festival with sacrifice and communion. In practice, both kinds of liturgy comprise a retreat as well as a subsequent sacrifice. In the present case of a three-day chiao ceremony, the first day, in terms of the rituals performed, is taken up with preparation for the retreat, the second day (counting from midnight to midnight) constitutes the retreat, and the third day is devoted to the sacrifice, chiao, from which the whole ceremony derives its name. As for the terms Golden and Yellow Registers, they originate in the early Taoist seasonal festivals, the Retreats of the Three Origins, San-yüan chai . The first festival, which fell in the New Year period and was called Shang-yüan , was dedicated to Heaven. Its divine administration was listed on the Golden Register. Similarly, the festival at the beginning of winter was called Hsia-yüan , and was dedicated to the earth and the infernal world. The dignitaries of those regions were known from the Yellow Register.

2. The long title of the head priest in charge of the ceremonies can only be approximated. This title is given the priest on ordination, and every priest's is slightly different. The first part corresponds to the Lu, a general title signifying the priest's rank. The second part, beginning “Holder and Preacher . . . ,” is the chih , the office to which the priest has been appointed.

The Lu of the Orthodox Covenant (with the Mighty Beings), Chengyi meng-wei , is the present-day equivalent of the fifth rank in the hierarchy of the Church of the Heavenly Master headquartered in the Lung-hu Mountains (which had little influence in Taiwan before the arrival of the 63d Heavenly Master). In Fukien and Taiwan, however, the Lu under discussion means much more, as is shown among other things by its association with the term chi-chiu , libationer. The chi-chiu, long forgotten by the clerical administration of Lung-hu, was in Han times the headman of the early Taoist communities. The title, borrowed from the Han rural administration, denoted a village elder, the dignitary chosen to make libations to the ancestors and local deities before community banquets. These “wise men” also had the prerogative of memorializing the throne in the event of bad management by local imperial officials. It is interesting that this title should have remained attached to the office of the ordained priest in Fukien and Taiwan while elsewhere it has been completely forgotten. More or less the same situation obtains for the Lu of the Orthodox Covenant. In Taiwan it is not just another rank, but is the highest title a traditional priest can be given at ordination. The point is of some historical interest because Cheng-yi meng-wei Lu was also the highest rank possible for a newly ordained priest in the early period of the movement. In later times, as the Han church was diminishing in importance, this title remained a prerogative for all Taoist priests conducting communal services, including those of sects and movements, such as the Ling-pao and Mao-shan sects, that did not belong to the Church of the Heavenly Master. This shows the fundamental importance of the liturgical canon elaborated and established in the early days of the Taoist church.

The second part of the title, corresponding to the “office,” was invented by the magically oriented instigators of the New Orthodox Church of the Heavenly Master of Southern Sung times and is of little importance. It denotes nothing specific, and can be chosen individually from several hundred variants, at random or through divination.

3. The expression of apprehension and humility is a standard formula found not only in this kind of Taoist literature, but also in similar documents of the imperial administration. The priest's function is defined as presenting the memorial to Heaven on the community's behalf. This role is not explicitly mentioned in the ordination documents, which instead stress the opposite role: tai-t'ien hsing-hua , civilizing (i.e. converting) on behalf of Heaven. The capacity to address memorials stems simply from the priest's status as an official of the divine administration and, as such, a mediator.

4. The population is defined as chung-hu-min , all the inhabitants. Geographically, the village is defined as part of the worldly administration. Through the mediation of the priest, however, it also belongs to the divine administration. As we have seen, the time of the festival is mentioned in cyclical characters only, without reference to any official era name. The place is immanent, the time transcendent. Dioceses, along with other administrative units, are invariably expressed in time values.

5. Chiao in Taiwan are invariably held in the local temple. This relationship is a profound one. Newly built temples are consecrated through a chiao, as is every major renovation. This in itself accounts for the regular celebrations of community chiao at intervals of approximately one generation.

All the rites of the first two days in our present example, that is, the retreat part of the service, are held inside the temple, behind locked doors. The greater part of the sacrifice part takes place in the open air, in front of, or near, the temple. The preparations for a chiao require major alterations in both the interior and the exterior of the sanctuary. Inside, the statues of the deities normally worshipped in the temple are removed from their regular niches, situated at the noble side (opposite the entrance), and placed on the exact opposite side, with their backs turned toward the closed doors. In this location, they are said to be “inspecting the sacrifice,” chien-chiao . Joining them are a host of usually smaller statues brought from the home altars of the faithful (who do not themselves participate in the proceedings), so that the part of the altar established inside the temple is crowded with deities of all possible kinds. Their place, which has a definite liturgical function, is known as San-kuan-cho , Table of the Three Officials (of Heaven, Earth, and Water), who represent, theologically, all the higher spiritual beings this side of the Tao. Opposite this table, at the noble side of the sanctuary, are placed five or more votive oil lamps. They are called tou-teng , bushel lamps (and in fact rest on pedestals made from rice measures of one bushel and filled with rice grains). These lamps symbolize fate : bushel = measure = the Dipper = the controller of Destiny.

6. The memorial next lists the names and titles of the community representatives. There is a connection between them and the bushel lamps, because each lamp represents the destiny of a given representative; together they stand for the fate of the community. The representative dignitaries or “Chiefs” are the only members of the community to participate in the ceremonies. The five main dignitaries, the Chief of the Assembly, et al., are the traditional ones. The title of the last of the five, Head of the Lamp of Heaven, refers to another votive lamp, which unlike the tou-teng is placed outside, in front of the temple, where it hangs on a long bamboo pole. Made of paper and round in form, it bears in large red characters the inscription “Lord of Heaven.” A similar bamboo pole with an identical lamp is installed in front of the Head of the Lamp's house. After the chiao, he may keep both lamps, hanging them before his home altar as a token of his dignity.

Similar votive lamps are dedicated to other deities who occupy secondary altars during the festival: the Three Officials, the Heavenly Master, Kuan Yin (associated with the p'u-tu), etc. Before these secondary altars are lamps like the one described above (the one for the Three Officials being hung on the temple ceiling) and similar poles before the dwellings of those responsible for them. All the ordinary faithful also have lamps on bamboo poles in front of their houses. Their lamps do not carry any deity's name, but are simply marked “prayer for peace.” They are represented at the ceremonies by a headman. Finally there are several assistant dignitaries, aides to the Chief of the Assembly. In certain rites, the five main dignitaries represent the faithful of the five orients, but in most cases their function is honorific, and very vague. They have the privilege and duty of assisting at all the ceremonies, holding incense sticks, standing when the priest stands, kneeling when he kneels, and having their personal fate lamps receive the most intense impact of the forthcoming blessings. They also have their names on the main memorial, while the names of the ordinary faithful are entered on the annexes, the so-called ting-k'ou shu .

Every family that wants its name included in the memorial must pay a certain sum, which is fixed before the chiao at a general community meeting. The basic rate for each family is the same, with increments for each child (the more one is blessed, the more one pays). In A-lien, most families paid NT $20 (U.S. $.50) per household, plus NT $5 for each son. People known to have been successful in business and community leaders are supposed to pay more. It is among the latter that the big contributors who serve as Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs at the ceremonies are recruited. Either a high price for each such post is fixed in advance by common consent, or the offices are distributed through divination, i.e. the throwing of the divination blocks among the largest contributors. The Chiefs are mostly the elderly heads of large and wealthy local families. They are not necessarily the organizers of the chiao. The latter, the tung-shih, kuan-li , or whatever they may be called, normally do not have their names entered in a special way on the memorial. But the custom of including them and their functions is gaining acceptance. In A-lien, only the main organizer, called the General Manager, gained the privilege of being mentioned along with the Chiefs.

The precise nomenclature of the dignitaries and representatives varies from place to place and is subject to (more or less precisely recalled) local traditions. In any case the Taoist priest, unless invited to intervene, accepts all titles and names as they are supplied to him by the organizers and enters them on the memorial.

7. This is the standard presentation of all the faithful at the chiao, and serves as the opening formula for the “intention” that follows. The reference to purification is pertinent. At a variable interval before the chiao begins, the entire village starts to observe certain restrictions: meager food, no sexual intercourse, no gambling, etc. The evening before the ceremonies begin, everyone takes a bath.

8. In general, the wording of the shu corresponds to established models and formulas. The text of the so-called intention or yi , however, in which the community explains why it is holding the service and formulates its vows, is free. The community, as was the case here, may commission someone to write it. In earlier times, many great men of letters wrote intentions for Taoist memorials, and some examples of their work have come down to us. The priest, too, normally has a manuscript collection of ready-made yi, which he may propose if the community itself lacks the means to produce one. In any case, the yi is considered the literary work of a layman, something outside the scope of Taoist writings, which are all supposed to be divinely inspired.

An intention normally begins with a few cosmological maxims, followed by a summary explanation of the reason for the service. In the present case, we see that the community has made a vow of a very general nature toward its tutelary saint, the Marshal Hsin, to whom the A-lien temple is dedicated. Hsin Yüan Shuai is a saint of modern Taoism. His cult is reputed to have been brought to A-lien from Foochow, and to have started in A-lien as a semi-private medium cult on a farm just outside the village. The first sanctuary was built around 1860, also outside the village. Only in 1905, ten years after the arrival of the Japanese, was a communal effort mounted to build a temple in A-lien itself, of which Hsin Yüan Shuai became the tutelary saint. Before its own temple was built, A-lien belonged to an association of twelve communities that worshipped at the temple in the neighboring village of T'u-k'u (not to be confused with a place of the same name in Yün-lin hsien). At this temple, dedicated to Hsüan T'ien Shang Ti, the Ruler of the North, exorcising deity and divine protector of the Ming, a chiao involving all twelve communities was held every three years. 7 In A-lien today, it is Marshal Hsin who is in charge of the population ( wei-min tso-chu says the memorial) and who transfers their prayers ( tai-wei chuan tsou ). The latter function, as we have seen, belongs during the chiao to the head priest, while Marshal Hsin is temporarily reduced to the role of communicant. But the chiao is also intended to be a service of thanksgiving for the blessings received through the Marshal's mediation. He is the divine benefactor of the village. The offerings are in the first place directed to him, as a solemn consecration of the bonds between him and the community.

9. The program of a chiao is fixed by the Taoist priest in accordance with immutable standards, the main variant being one of duration. A five-day chiao includes many more rituals than one lasting two days, but the same rationale underlies all such ceremonies, and they all follow the sequence of preparation-retreat-sacrifice. The sequence and also the time of execution (morning, evening, night) are all predetermined; the memorials preserved over the last two hundred years, from both Taiwan and the mainland, as well as those preserved in the Taoist Canon, show that the system is very traditional indeed and virtually unchangeable. During the three days of ceremonies at A-lien, eighteen different rituals were performed by the head priest and his four acolytes, two (preliminary purification and cloture) were performed by a single acolyte, and the reading of the different sutras and litanies (during the intervals between rituals) was done by one acolyte at a time, on a rotating basis.

The memorial enumerates all the rituals, one by one. Included in the list are rituals that may or may not be executed by the Taoists: the Buddhist p'u-tu and the siu:-pieng , a Huat-su ritual. At the A-lien chiao, the Feeding of the Hungry Spirits was done by Buddhists as well as Taoists, and the siu:-pieng by a local Huat-su. Both rituals are performed on the third day of the festival, the day of sacrifice. Both also take place near or during the evening, when in principle the Taoist ritual is already completed. But both figure in the Taoist memorial as an integrated part of the service.

At each of the eighteen major rituals, the memorial is read at least once. Although the document is in the head priest's name, the actual reciting of it is done by an acolyte. During the recitation, the head priest prostrates himself in front of the altar, and the Chiefs, behind him, follow suit. During certain rituals the head priest performs a silent meditation while the reading goes on. His meditation takes the form of a confession of sins, directed to the patriarchs of the Taoist church, notably the original Heavenly Master. In the ritual the head priest is considered the patriarchs' representative, and, while presenting the memorial, he transfers it to the patriarchs for them to transmit higher up, to the Lord of Heaven at the pinnacle of the pantheon. The day date is left open at the end of the memorial because the priest cannot foresee the date at which the patriarchs will effect the transfer. The patriarchs will insert it themselves when the time comes.

Only the main part of the memorial is normally read at all eighteen major rituals. The complete version, including annexes, with all the names of the common faithful, is read on only three occasions. The first is at the very beginning of the service. The second is at the very solemn ritual with which the third day of ceremonies, the day devoted to the sacrifice, begins. A high platform (with an altar table and offerings on top) is erected in the open air, in front of the temple. The head priest and his acolytes ceremonially ascend this altar to present the message of the impending sacrifice to the Lord of Heaven. On this solemn public occasion, the names of all the faithful, along with the numbers of sons and daughters, are recited. While this ritual is taking place, each household prepares, at home, offerings to the Lord of Heaven. Among them is usually a sacrificed pig. The offerings are put on a festively decorated table at the foot of the lamp pole. When the ritual is over, the acolytes visit each home to purify and consecrate the offerings. Their duties include the recitation of a short individual memorial stating the household's exact address, the names and birthdates of all its members, and a general prayer to “the High Perfect Beings.” This part of the communal service is called in the main memorial ke-chia hsin-hsiang yen men hsüan-shu . For the Chiefs and other dignitaries, the head priest, surrounded by his acolytes, performs this service. In these cases the individual offerings are very abundant and presented in a special setting, often a temporary “Altar of Heaven” erected in front of or near the Chief's house. These temporary altars, made of bamboo and paperboard, are elaborately painted and ornamented so as to resemble a real temple. They sometimes have two or more stories, making them towers from which to address Heaven. Inside these altars, the Chiefs expose their family's heirlooms and treasures: antiques, silver and gold coins, dwarf trees, etc.

10. All memorials of this kind end with this phrase. The ultimate recipients of the village's request are the High Perfect Beings, i.e. all the gods of Heaven.

In a highly condensed form, the memorial incorporates all aspects of the service. It is read a final time at the solemn presentation of the sacrifice, the real chiao ceremony, the concluding ritual of the entire celebration. After this, the bans are lifted and the Feeding of the Hungry Spirits can begin, to be followed by the festive communal banquets at which the offerings are consumed. Unlike individual memorials and the many other written prayers presented at almost every rite, which are invariably burned as part of the ceremony, a collective memorial such as the one discussed here is preserved.

Ong Thuan had once been the fattest man and the best drinker in Ploughshare, but he developed diabetes in his late forties, becoming too debilitated to do any work. Hence it was not surprising when he died at 49, five days before the lunar New Year, in January 1973.

Thuan's body had to be disposed of before the joyous New Year holiday, so when So A-bieng, an old man who handles funeral arrangements for other villagers, went to San-hsia to consult a geomancer about a suitable time for burial, he hoped to be able to find one before New Year's. Fortunately, there was an auspicious day, and the geomancer prepared a schedule which would be pasted outside the door of Thuan's house. This recorded the date and time of Thuan's birth and death and stated that his body was to be placed in the coffin between 5 and 7 a.m. on the 30the of January, the coffin was to be brought out of the house at the same time on the 31st and buried between 3 and 5 the same afternoon, facing in a specified direction. Only thus would the characters of Thuan's own birth and death be in harmony with those of the times and orientation of his burial, insuring that his family would not suffer from any ill effects of disharmonious interment. But this burial conflicted with the characters for people born in certain years, and these were warned on the same schedule to stay away from the encoffining, the bringing the coffin out of the house, and the actual burial.

Until the encoffining Thuan's body rested before his ancestral altar, covered by a sheet, and silver paper was burnt continuously to light the way for his soul on its journey to the spirit world, or im-kan . During this time, a priest came from San-hsia and erected a paper ancestral tablet where Thuan's spirit would also reside until a permanent wooden tablet was made two years later. Food and changes of clothing were placed at the feet of the body morning and evening until the burial.

Four young village men brought the coffin from San-hsia in a two-wheeled pull-cart on the evening of the 29th. After depositing it in Thuan's house they washed their hands carefully; even an empty coffin is dirty because of its contact with death. Early the next morning, as the body was encoffined, a priest from town ritually cut Thuan off from contact with the living: he tied one end of a string around a hand of the corpse and asked all the relatives and friends who were helping out to stand in line with the string in their hands; then he cut the string between each pair of hands. After this the lid was sealed on the coffin, which would rest in the house until the next morning.

For some funerals the kong-tik , or merit-making rituals, last all day, but Thuan's family was poor and decided on a shorter version. So when I arrived in front of Thuan's house early the next morning, I found very little activity: a few people were coming and going, and the strident wailing of Thuan's two sons and his female relatives could be heard behind the closed doors of his house. Despite the injunction that the coffin be taken out of the house between 5 and 7, it was still inside. Moving it slightly during that period was sufficient compliance; it would be taken out later when there were more men around to help.

The early part of the morning was taken by practical concerns -- a feast had to be prepared, albeit a rather simple one, so anyone from the village with spare time stopped by and helped with preparation of food and tableware. Female relatives and neighbors sewed mourning costumes in Thuan's youngest brother's house, pausing occasionally to beg Thuan's aged mother to stop wailing over the coffin and come back to her youngest son's house and rest. Each time she rested for a short time, but eventually went back to wail again. The loud, almost melodious wailing is a required part of the ritual for some mourners, and when an old person dies at the end of a full life, it is often merely perfunctory. But for someone like Thuan who died in what should have been the prime of life, the grief is real and so are the tears.

Five priests arrived around 10 o'clock and began preparing for the merit-making rituals. They hung stylized portraits of Buddhist deities not ordinarily worshipped by villagers in a house next to Thuan's, along with scrolls graphically representing the tortures and punishments of the ten courts of judgment the dead man's soul would have to pass through on its way to a permanent resting place. The primary purpose of the priests' ritual was to expedite the soul through these courts, and to this end they made two white pennants, one expressing the wish that Thuan's soul reach the Western Paradise as quickly as possible, and the other expressing similar wishes for Thuan's long-dead father and for a son who died in infancy. In the popular view the meritmaking ceremonies also serve to provide a comfortable life for the spirit in the afterworld, so people often have a second ceremony performed for a previously deceased relative when they are having a funeral anyway.

The kong-tik rituals last most of the day. They consist of innumerable offerings, chants, flag-wavings and prostrations with specific purposes unknown to the descendants who perform them at the direction of the priests. They are separate from the funeral ritual proper, the content and purpose of which is known to everyone. Nobody can remember an adult who was buried without a proper funeral, but it was formerly fairly common for poor families to forgo the kong-tik because of the expense.

While the priests continued with the kong-tik , some village men set up a table in the courtyard outside Thuan's house and began to receive and record contributions. Every household in Ploughshare customarily contributes at least 50 New Taiwan Dollars (U.S. $ 1.25) at every village funeral, and people filtered by all morning, placing their white envelopes on the table, watching their names written on the list of contributors, and stopping to chat for a while. Relatives arrived later and contributed more, so that the greater part of the funeral expenses was defrayed by a total collection of about U.S. $ 600.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual125,Shamans Posession and Divination of Illness/Madness,"Ong A-bi is Cured of Madness

When I knew her, A-bi was 16 years old, a normal Taiwanese adolescent except that she walked with a slight limp and did much more work than the average teenage girl. She had to, because she lived alone with her blind grandfather in the poorest housing in Ploughshare -- two dirt-floored rooms of an old mud-brick compound across the street from our house. A-bi's grandfather Tiu: Pun-a, made a little money as a medical practitioner -- he was reputed to be adept at setting bones and at curing injuries caused by falls, but living in an out-of-the-way place like Ploughshare he didn't have much business. So it seemed a good thing all around when A-bi went to work in an electronics factory near the market town of Shu-lin -- she worked the 4 p.m. to midnight shift, and the bus from the factory transported her both ways. But Pun-a's satisfaction turned to grave apprehension on February 21, when A-bi did not return on the midnight bus.

Pun-a and some of his real and sworn relatives spent the next day looking for A-bi; the old man went all the way to Taipei to visit his only daughter, A-bi's adopted mother, but she knew nothing of the girl's whereabouts either. A-bi was gone the next night as well, but on the afternoon of the 23rd Pun-a found her in her mother's house in Taipei, and around 10 o'clock that evening she returned to the village. Around 11 o'clock the whole neighborhood was awakened by sounds reminiscent of funeral wailing coming from her house. Running outside in pajamas and jackets, we could see that she was inside her house crying desperately while her grandfather and some female neighbors tried to quiet her down. They were successful around 2 or 3 in the morning, and when I talked to Pun-a at around 9 or 9:30, he said she was overtired and was sleeping quietly.

The next day when I saw A-bi in the afternoon, she seemed somewhat shaken, but was displaying no signs of overt hysteria. I learned that Pun-a's younger brother's wife, a woman with whom the blind man had had almost no contact lately because of a previous quarrel, had taken A-bi to the temple at Paichi to have her soul called back. Taiwanese religion posits that a living person, as well as a dead one, has a soul, but seems to care little about it until it is somehow dislodged from the body in which case states of mental dissociation result. Soul loss is usually a result of having taken fright, and people guessed that this was what had happened to A-bi, a conjecture strengthened by the fact that she had apparently become disoriented and gotten lost on the way home from the factory where she had been working.

The hope that A-bi's soul had been called back was shattered on the afternoon of the 24th when, in the street in front of her grandfather's brother's house, she suddenly broke into a violent crying spell. She yelled “grandfather, grandfather,” but when her grandfather felt his way out into the street to meet her, she ran the other way, wailing hysterically. This, of course, attracted a sizeable crowd, and two of the women tried to restrain her while someone quickly went to fetch So A-bieng, who could tell the nature of her madness by looking into her eyes. She wasn't about to let him, but finally the two women restraining her forced her to allow him to look, and it took but a second for him to determine her trouble; “Her soul is gone, someone go right to San-hsia and ask Co-su Kong to come and diagnose her trouble.” Li Kim-hok, a son of Pun-a's deceased elder brother, immediately disappeared in the direction of town.

They soon coaxed A-bi back into her house, where she continued to cry and female relatives continued to try to quiet her by a mixture of comforting and shaming. One of them would cradle the girl's head in her arms, saying “It's all right, it doesn't make any difference, you're all right,” and when this temporarily had no results would switch tactics and say, “Look how you're acting with all these people around, now stop it!” They also attempted to get A-bi to drink some water or sodapop, but when they did, A-bi would simply change her lament from “Grandfather, Grandfather, I haven't done anything wrong, I haven't done anything wrong today,” to “I don't want to, I don't want to drink any.” She was obviously beyond human help.

As I stood outside A-bi's house I heard people speculating on what might be the matter, and some at least agreed that the probable cause was someone's writing an evil hu against the girl. A hu is a written charm, usually consisting of some meaningful Chinese characters and some occult signs that look like characters or are derived from them. Most hu are beneficial and can be good for the general purpose of preventing misfortune or for something more specific, usually the cure of an illness. But there are malevolent hu also, little understood but greatly feared charms which cause madness or facilitate seduction. But this was merely a guess and would have to be confirmed by Co-su Kong's diagnosis.

After an hour or so, Kim-hok returned from the San-hsia temple with a small image of Co-su Kong on the front of his bicycle. This was Lak-co, the sixth brother and the smallest size image available. There was some consternation at this, for people usually consider a particular image called Lau Sa:-co, the old third brother, as the most reliable for diagnosis. Kim-hok had asked about Lau Sa:-co, but he was out doctoring somebody else, so Lak-co was brought as a substitute for his brother. After some consultation the women attending A-bi decided that Lak-co just would not do, so they asked Kim-hok to go back to San-hsia again, find whoever had Lau Sa:-co and ask their permission to let him borrow the image for one consultation. He disappeared again in the direction of town.

While Kim-hok was gone, they brought Lak-co from his house to Pun-a's and erected a makeshift altar for him; Pun-a was so poor that he had no altar at all in his rented quarters, but worshipped the gods at their temples and his ancestors at his brother's house across the river in Ta-p'u. So they placed Lak-co on a rather rickety square table, with an incense burner made from a tin can filled with raw rice grains and set out a few offerings of cookies and snacks. Pun-a wanted to seek diagnosis in the most advantageous manner, so when the altar was set up he took divining blocks in his hand and began to ask procedural questions. First, he asked if Co-su Kong could perform the diagnosis, and the answer was positive. Then he asked if Lak-co could do it without the aid of his elder brother, and again the answer was affirmative, even though Kim-hok had already gone to find the larger image. Finally, he inquired if his house was a suitable place to diagnose the illness, as there was no altar there, and it would be easy for Pun-a to move the proceedings to his third brother's house, a handsome dwelling with a new and elaborate family altar. But the god seemed not to care about such trimmings; he indicated the Pun-a's house would be satisfactory.

It was not too long until Kim-hok returned from San-hsia again -- he had found Lau Sa:-co at a house in town, and since the people there were not holding any consultation that evening, they had agreed to let Kim-hok borrow the image and bring him back to them the next morning. So they placed Lau Sa:-co on the same table in a position to the stage left of his younger brother.

While intending to rely fully on the supernatural to determine the cause and ultimate cure of A-bi's madness, those concerned with her case were still willing to seek temporary and symptomatic relief from Western medicine. Accordingly, they called in the doctor from Ta-p'u to give her a sedative, which he came and administered around 7 in the evening. After an hour or so it took effect, and her wails became more muted. In a few minutes she was so easily restrained that two women could hold her and pour down her throat a concoction of water and smoke from the incense burning before Co-su Kong's images. A few seconds later she fell asleep and was carried to her bedroom by one of the attending women.

At about the time A-bi fell asleep the shaman arrived. Usually people in Ploughshare employ Hai-a, a man who has just recently moved out of the village, to serve as shaman, but he had been recently injured in a motorcycle accident, so they had to search for a suitable medium, and finally found one in the nearby community of Mua-hng. He would speak with the god's voice and diagnose the cause of A-bi's madness. For Taiwanese religion states that a shaman can enter a trance and have his own soul leave his body to be replaced by the spirit of a god. When this happens, the god is physically present in the shaman's body, and people can talk directly to the deity.

The shaman, or tang-ki , appeared to be a man in his late twenties; he was accompanied by a huat-su , an older man who knew the verses which had to be chanted to call the god to come and inhabit the shaman's body. When they arrived, they burned incense to the god's two images, then scattered rice and salt around the room. Because gods can sometimes act violently when physically present during a seance, the two images were moved out of the way to the top of a food cabinet near the table where they had rested, and things such as cooking pots, which might hurt someone if knocked about, were put in the safest places available in Pun'a's cramped quarters.

Then the tang-ki took off his sandals and sat upright on a wooden bench in front of the square table, closing his eyes. The huat-su began to chant, slowly and deliberately, while burning three or four sheets of gold paper in his hand and waving them about the room until they burned too close to the flesh, when he would light another bundle and discard the first upon the floor. After five minutes or so the tang-ki , who seemed to be concentrating deeply on allowing the god to come and possess his body, suddently looked around and said in a normal voice that the god hadn't come yet, and perhaps there was somebody present who was ritually unclean and should there fore leave. Gods abhor the ritual pollution brought on by menstruation, childbirth, or contact with death and corpses, and will recoil from the presence of a person so polluted. Whether anybody actually left or not, I wasn't sure. At the same time Pun-a took three sticks of incense and stepped out the door of his house to invite the god to come in.

One or both of these strategies apparently worked, for after another minute or so, the tang-ki began to shake his head and roll his body from side to side, and his breathing became forced and heavy. All these were signs that the god was beginning to possess his body. Soon he was bouncing up and down and slapping his thighs, and finally he stood up and pounded on the table several times, once emitting a high-pitched squeak and once a lower yell. Then, the god in full possession of his body, he began to speak. The first thing he said was “Everybody short get out.” People were not sure exactly what this meant, but they shooed out the few children who were there and then all left themselves except for Kim-hok and his brother Kim-hieng, who were holding the table, the huat-su , Pun-a, A-bi's natural mother who had come from the nearby town of Ying-ko, and a rather sheepish ethnographer trying to look inconspicuous (fat chance) in a dark corner.

The god then explained that it was A-bi's grandmother and grandfather, at which point Pun-a, holding incense between his hands, stepped up and said, “Her grandfather's right here.” The god stopped to figure for a minute and then said, “That's right, it's her great-grandfather,” meaning Pun-a's father. Why her great-grandparents were angry enough at A-bi to cause her madness, the god did not volunteer. Then he said there was also a thirty year old ong-si kui (ghost of a man who died violently) who attacked the girl on the road in Chiao-hsi, the rural district immediately below Ploughshare. When the god was about to give his prescription, Kim-hok motioned to me to come over and write, and stuck a Chinese writing brush in my hand. I was supposed to write the cure for madness which involved placating both the roadside ghost and the great-grandparents. First, someone was to go to Chiao-hsi at exactly 10:00 the next morning and bring back seven dirt clods from the roadside there. They were to make an infusion of these clods, combined with a sprig each of three kinds of medicinal grasses and some silver spirit money, and wash A-bi with it. They were also to leave offerings to the ghost at the roadside, one bowl of rice and six of raw leafy vegetables. Then, at exactly 12 o'clock on the same day they were to worship Puna's ancestors, presumably at one of his brothers' houses, with six bowls of rice, and burn specified amounts of gold spirit money and kho-ci: , a kind of spirit paper which is used to support and secure the head of a corpse when it is placed in the coffin.

Neither of these offerings was remotely similar to any I had heard of before; they seemed to do violence to the fairly neat ritual system used for customary offerings (Ahern 1973:167ff). It is common to try to propitiate ghosts who are diagnosed by shamans as causing illness; but this is usually done with a bowl of rice and some cooked foods, not with raw vegetables. And why six bowls of rice to the ancestors, with no other foods to accompany them, I am still puzzled. Even more peculiar was the burning of gold money which is almost always reserved for gods, and kho-ci: which is ordinarily used only in funeral ceremonies. Anyway, the participants accepted the god's prescriptions without hesitation.

The god also said that A-bi should not go outside any more than necessary while her condition persisted, and should by all means stay away from work at the factory. When he seemed to be through with diagnosis of her case, Li Kimhieng asked him about his adopted daughter's chronic arthritis, for which the god gave a rather ordinary prescription. Then the tang-ki , who had been standing and pounding rhythmically on the table with both hands, suddenly grabbed three sticks of incense and collapsed on the table in front of him, and the god was gone -- the trance was ended. He stayed bent over for a minute or two, and two men had to call to him before he awakened rather like a heavy sleeper being aroused from a deep slumber. He was coherent and seemed normal again, but he refused a bowl of the noodles which are usually served at the close of a shamanistic session.

The next morning Pun-a and his relatives carried out the required rituals, but there seemed to be only slight improvement in A-bi's condition. The talk of her ailment was everywhere in the village, and there was much speculation as to whether the god's diagnosis had been correct or not. But correct or mistaken, it was quite frightening to some people at least. My landlady's daughter, 14 years old, seemed quite impressed and slightly frightened when I hold her what had happened; Pun-a's elder brother's daughter-in-law expressed a similar reaction. Telling someone of the ghost to whom the trouble was partially attributed, she referred to an ong-si hit-o-e , a “one of those who died a violent death,” being afraid to call it a kui , or ghost.

This same woman, strangely enough, had her own reason for the illness, quite unrelated to an ong-si anything or to Pun-a's parents. She recalled that another women, now about 33 years old and also called A-bi, had had a similar attack of madness while living in the house Pun-a was now renting, and at about the same age as the girl now being affected. Obviously, it was the house which was at fault, probably because it was haunted by ghosts of previous residents. I knew a similar case in a nearby farming community where I did fieldwork previously; after many attempts to exorcise the ghosts from that house it was finally abandoned and stood in ruins by the time I saw it. I heard two other people mention this theory independently, although Pun-a refuted it strenously when I asked him. He said that he could tell by feeling the door and walls whether a house was haunted or not, and if this one had been, he surely would never have rented it.

Sometime during these first few days after A-bi's initial acute attack, Pun'a took two other measures to try to cure his granddaughter, neither of which was indicated by Co-su Kong in his original diagnosis. First, he went to Wu-liao, a place deep in the mountains to visit a hu-a sien-si: , a master of writing hu . Despite the Co-su Kong's diagnosis of ghosts and ancestors as the cause of A-bi's madness and the rather simple remedies which he prescribed, the talk which I heard about the incident kept turning to the subject of hu -- not only that a malevolent hu had possibly caused the illness, but that a Hu-a Sien-si: would probably be the right person to cure it. The man in Wu-liao apparently treated A-bi as best he could, but to no avail, as her attacks continued, usually at least one acute screaming spell each afternoon. In addition Pun-a had gone to the Tho-te-biou in Ploughshare, asking Tho-te Kong to search far and wide for A-bi's soul. If he brought it back, Pun-a would reward him with a suitable offering. But this didn't work either.

Two or three days later, around the 27th or 28th of February, A-bi, who had not improved much, left her grandfather's house to live for a while with her natural mother in Ying-ko. When she returned on the 13th or 14th of March, she seemed somewhat better, so that she was able to take her grandfather grocery shopping. But on the morning of the 16th, returning from the store, she began crying again. This time it was not the funeral-like wailing, screaming and pouting in coherent sentences which we had heared before. Rather, the girl was reduced to hoarse grunts and groans with no apparent words to them. Something needed to be done, and they called in a hu writer to try to cure her. This was not the wizened old man usually thought of as adept at charm-writing, however, it was a young woman ferried there on the back of her brother's motorcycle. She said she had cured many cases of this kind and that it had three primary causes. First, there was something wrong with her spirit or character (ching-sin), a statement I can tentatively interpret as meaning what we would call mental illness and not concerned with the supernatural. Second, her un , or luck, was very bad. A person's luck, like his fate, is determined by the characters representing the time of birth. But fate is one's destiny to be rich or poor, something which works itself out over the course of an entire lifetime, while luck is one's likelihood to contract supernaturally caused illness and changes every few years. People whose luck is bad are more likely to be attacked by ghosts or even to see them, so it stood to reason that A-bi's luck was bad when she suffered ghostly malice. The third cause of her illness was taking fright.

The woman's approach to curing consisted of a combination of profuse charm wiriting and a sort of supportive psychotherapy. She sat by A-bi on a bench and wrote several charms on gold spirit money with red ink, directing A-bi's female relatives to post them at various places in the house: over the front door, on the wall above the stove, over A-bi's bed, and so forth. She also wrote some hu for A-bi to eat in infusion and traced characters with the red brush in a mug of hot tea which the girl was later to drink. She wrote a charm on A-bi's forehead as well. While she was doing this, she comforted the girl, telling her to calm down, it would be all right, and when the girl had quieted down somewhat, that she should try to go to sleep. When A-bi seemed much calmer, the threapist said, “Let's go to sleep; I'll go in and go to sleep with you.” She then carried the girl, no longer crying very loud, into the bedroom.

When she emerged after 15 or 20 minutes, she said the girl was not asleep, but was lying quietly on the bed, which was a good sign. In her experience, she explained, her cures would work much faster if she could get them to sleep. She seemed to have confidence in her own curing abilities, though she prudently refused to pinpoint the interval necessary for A-bi's complete recovery.

Apparently, though, the woman's efforts had been fruitless, for that same afternoon A-bi had another attack in the street above our house -- she ran back and forth for a long time, and when Li Kim-hieng finally tried to lead her forcibly back into her house, she refused and became even more hysterical. She would point toward her house and say, “I'm not going, I'm not going, the crazy woman's in there.” After lengthy effort, he got her as far as the doorway where she went absolutely limp in the manner of a non-violent resister. Kim-hieng then picked her up and carried her into the house.

The next day I talked to Pun-a. I had been extremely hesitant to ask him about this sensitive and embarrassing matter, even though he was a willing informant and a close neighbor. But when I did approach him, I could hardly get him to stop talking; it seemed as if he needed to pour out his troubles upon anyone who would listen. He told me that his granddaughter had had two more really acute attacks, one the evening before and one that morning. In reply to any approach or question from him her only answer was “Screw your mother,” a common Taiwanese curse. He would ask her if she had a mother, and she wouldn't know; he would ask her if she knew who he was, and no response, so then he would hit her, and she would yell, “Screw your mother” at him. After a while she would calm down a little and call “Grandfather, Grandfather.” He would then ask her, “Who are you that you should call me Grandfather,” and she would say “I'm your grandchild,” and go on crying in the wailing manner of her first attacks.

Pun-a's diagnosis of his granddaughter's troubles remained much the same as Co-su Kong's original formulation -- his father and a malevolent ghost were both attacking the girl. In addition he said it had now been determined that there was a second ghost which had seized her when she went to the Hu-a Sien-si: in Wu-liao. To prove this he showed me a paper which the woman charm-writer had given him the day before. It said there was trouble with Good Brothers in the northeasterly direction, which did indeed fit the suspicion of the angry ghost in Chiao-hsi. But there was also a mention of someone surnamed Ong in a southwesterly direction. Now Wu-liao is south of Ploughshare, not southwest, but with the twists and turns in mountain roads, such a small error is understandable. What is not so easily solved is the mention of someone named Ong as the attacker -- angry ghosts at roadsides do not ordinarily have surnames, and when I read this to Pun-a, he ignored what I had read and said it was im-ping , or soldiers of the im , another word for ghosts, who were attacking A-bi from the southwest. He had read the woman's diagnosis as conforming with his own beliefs about the matter.

Pun-a also told me why his parents were angry enough with A-bi to contribute to her madness; this had been a puzzle both to me and to others with whom I had discussed the matter, since ancestors who are provided with descendants to worship them do not usually bother their descendants. It was true, the old man said, that he had five brothers, all of whom had living sons. But his eldest brother was an illegitimate child of his mother and so bore the surname Ong, and did not worship any of his Tiu: ancestors. Pun-a was the next in line, the eldest legitimate child and the first to bear his father's surname, Tiu:. But Pun-a's fate had been bad; he had been married only 34 months when his wife died, and to that time she had borne him only one daughter and no sons. This daughter had married a mainlander uxorilocally whose surname was Wang (the Mandarin Chinese reading for Ong), and their three daughters all carried their father's surname, leaving nobody in Pun-a's line to carry on the name of Tiu:. Pun-a's four younger brothers all had sons named Tiu:, but that was no matter; what his parents wanted was descendants who bore the Tiu: surname in the line of descent of the eldest son . Since A-bi's mother was already in her forties and not likely to bear any more children, the burden of descent would fall on A-bi or one of her sisters. Pun-a had gone to his brother's house and thrown divining blocks in front of the ancestral altar, asking which of the three granddaughters his deceased wife wanted as a descendant. She indicated A-bi. This did not mean, however, that A-bi would immediately have to change her surname from Ong to Tiu:; it merely meant that when she married her husband uxorilocally (for her parents had no sons), in addition to giving some children her surname, Ong, and others the surname of her unknown husband, they would have to give at least one male child her grandfather's surname, Tiu:; this would satisfy the angry ancestors by providing them with a descendant.

But the promise to the ancestors did not seem to have done much good; neither had the woman hu writer. So they had decided to go to a god again and find out if there was anyone who could cure A-bi. Pun-a's sworn brother's widow had taken A-bi to the temple at Pai-chi, and by the use of divining blocks had first asked if the problem was taking fright, and the answer was no. She then asked if it was a physical problem, and again the answer was no. Was the cause then her soul having been taken away (by ghosts or evil magic), and the answer was yes. In this case was there a practitioner in Taipei who could cure her? No. In Ying-ko? Yes. So they would give the cure administered by the young woman one more day, and if A-bi were not better in the morning, they would call in an old hu-a sien-si : from Ying-ko, a man of reputed extraordinary powers.

On the night of the 17th A-bi slept peacefully, and she seemed somewhat better on the 18th, sleeping quietly again that night. But the worry remained and A-bi still appeared very disturbed, so they brought in the man from Ying-ko on the morning of the 19th. He came in a taxi, having been persuaded to come against his own inclination by a friend of his who also happened to be A-bi's natural mother's boss at work. As soon as he arrived at Pun-a's house he asked for a package of gold paper and began to make hu out of it. He cut one in the shape of a paper doll, another a paper snowflake, still others strips of various lengths and widths. With a writing brush and a water solution of red food coloring he wrote characters and signs over all of these with great speed and an air of confident knowledge. All but two or three of these charms he folded around three sticks of unlighted incense and waved the bundle first in front of standing A-bi, then over her head, then in back of her. Two small hu he gave to Pun-a's brother's wife, one for A-bi to eat and one to wash her with, both as infusions of their ashes. He then took two other strings and crossed them, led them over a stick of intact gold paper, and waved them over the girl as well. Finally, he gave the large bundle of charms and incense to Pun-a, whom he directed to go outside to a place where people seldom walked, face south, and burn the paper and incense.

The magician left as quickly as he came, and people were impressed with his performance. He had but to look at the girl's eyes, they said, and he came up with the correct diagnosis, ghost soldiers of Iu-ieng Kong, himself a spirit of unknown dead who is more like a ghost than a god. Shrines are built to him to ward off the danger of his presence, and only secondarily to be able to ask help from him. The Hu-a Sien-si: was clearly of higher skill than the woman who had come and done similar cures two days before. As evidence people cited the fact that A-bi had been quiet on the nights of the 18th and 19th, so his cure must have worked, despite the conveniently forgotten fact that the Sien-si: did not come until the morning of the 19th.

On the 21st, A-bi had one more attack, which Pun-a blamed on the fact that her father's father and her mother's father's father were somehow in supernatural conflict. But other people rediculed this diagnosis, asking how the spirit of her father's father, clear in the West Chinese province of Szechuan, could come all the way over to Taiwan to bother her. Perhaps he could fly?

After this A-bi had no more attacks and steadily improved, so that by the time I left Ploughshare in mid-April, she seemed normal again. But she still had not returned to work at the electronics factory.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual126,Prophylactic Exorcism Rite (Shiehtuu),"Exorcism: The Shiehtuu

When the rite of passing through oil is performed in connection with a god's birthday, it is a prophylactic rite, and its performance is primarily a drama of what the god would do if the houses of his devotees were threatened by disaster. This is not to say that such purification is not desirable or efficacious. Of course it is. But it is not necessary, save as it is a part of the festivity of the god's birthday.

The case is somewhat different when exorcism is performed for the relief of particular misfortunes of a specific family. During the period I lived in Bao-an, several families attempted to improve their financial fortunes and the health of their members by means of a rite called a Shiehtuu . 

This rite was typically performed when the family was suffering from generalized inharmony that could not be directly related to any specific misfortunes. Ill health, financial reversals, and domestic quarrels stalked in the family circle, and eventually it was decided that something was wrong and an oracle was consulted which recommended a Shiehtuu .

The Shiehtuu rites are complex and depend for their full exposition on an understanding of the chants themselves, which I do not have. In general, they are an exorcism and ritual cleansing of the house and the people living in it. The rite seems to be a composite of several different parts, which occur also in other contexts. I do not propose to analyze all of these here, but to mention certain ones that are directly relevant to our present purposes.

The priests perform chants in the afternoon which contain (as I understand it) magical formulae designed to bring the evil forces in the house under their power. Early in the evening one priest seats himself on the floor of the central room of the house and faces a crockery pot over which a piece of brown paper is tightly stretched and on which a few grains of rice have been placed. At one side of the paper there is a series of small holes, perhaps five to eight millimeters in diameter. As the priest chants and burns small yellow papers said to “open the eyes of spirits,” an assistant bangs rhythmically on a small gong. The grains of rice make their way in short, irregular hops from their randomly scattered positions across the brown paper on the pot toward the holes, until they tumble into the pot through these small openings. When the last grain of rice has dropped into the pot, the evil forces of the house are considered to be concentrated in the pot, and it is carried as quickly as possible out of the village to a spot some distance into the fields, often the bed of a dry irrigation canal. Here it is staked to the ground with a charm stake of the same general type as we saw used in identifying the forts at the corners of the village. This expedition to the fields is overseen and led by a ki[unknown] o-á borne by village people, although one of the âng-thâu-á bears the pot and stakes it to the ground.

The forces in the pot are dangerous. Were they driven from the house but allowed to remain in the village, they would endanger the houses of others, if not of their original host. Once they are taken outside the village, they can reenter it only by overpowering the soldiers who man the boundary lines and forts of the village itself. This is perhaps one of the most explicit points of tangency between the microcosm of the house and the macrocosm of the village, each seen as a sacred domain existing in space.

By the time this expedition has returned, a basin of oil has been heated for the rite of “passing through oil,” which constitutes the heart of the rites. Under the direction of the ki[unknown] o-á and usually a tâng-ki as well, the oil is fired in the central room of the house, where each object of the altar is passed through successive columns of flame. Then it is carried to the other rooms of the house and is fired once in each room. As it leaves the room, firecrackers are ignited in the room. Both the oil fire and the firecrackers are understood to frighten, purge, and destroy malign forces, and the house has already been emptied of those forces that were carried out magically captured in the pot. When all the rooms have been thus purified, the oil is carried to each corner of the house and fired once more, as a stake with a charm secured to the top of it is pounded into the floor of the central room, beneath the center of the red approach table, or higher of the two family altar tables.

When this has been completed, the âng-thâu-á performs a rite that by itself is known as “changing luck”. This is performed by some âng-thâu-á in public temples in Tainan, and occasionally occurs in Bao-an without an âng-thâu-á if someone else who knows the chants can perform it. Each member of the family is provided with a paper figure of himself, which he carries across a bench representing a bridge. Arriving at the end of the bench, he sits down and the officiant takes away the paper figure and recites charms causing malign forces affecting the body to rest instead in the paper body, which is subsequently burned outside the boundaries of the village.

The Shiehtuu rites usually last from early afternoon to just past midnight. Usually a punch-and-judy show is provided for the pleasure of household gods in the afternoon and early evening, and neighbors are invited to bring food for late-afternoon sacrifices to the Good Brethren, that is, to the hungry ghosts in the vicinity by way of propitiation. The punch-and-judy, whatever its supernatural effects, provides an added inducement to would-be sacrificers.

One of the features most striking about all this is that the core of the rites, the purification of the house, is a scaled-down version of the rites of exorcism and purification described in connection with the protection of the village from generalized evil influences. The stakes at the four corners of the house represent the forts of the house, just as the stakes at the four trees around the village represent forts. The purification by oil is the same. The purification of individual sacred objects from the family altar is the same as the purification of objects on the altar of the village temple.

In other words, one part of this rite, and, so far as I understand it, the core part, makes the house a microcosm of the village. It is guided by the same logic (expelling malign forces), expressed in the same idiom (forts), performed by the same practitioners ( âng-thâu-á ) with the same equipment (oil, stakes) as the village exorcism described earlier. This general homology between the village macrocosm and the family microcosm has appeared more than once so far and is worth singling out for further examination.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual127,Triennial Festival: Wangjiaw,"But King Guo is not merely a benevolent outsider who puts in his oar only at local invitation. He is also the protector of the village, and accordingly from time to time he makes a visit. Bao-an, like other villages in the Hsikang region, participates in a triennial festival. The festival is called a Wangjiaw and is performed in honor of visiting divine inspectors of extraordinarily high rank. The rites involve, among other things, a procession in which local gods move through the villages of the area for three days to provide themselves with a change (1) to inspect their territory, (2) to drive out misfortune and correct injustice, and (3) to pay their respects on behalf of their village constituencies to the visiting inspectors. The core elements of this procession are palanquins containing the gods of the participating villages. Normally, each village is represented by at least one palanquin filled with small josses belonging to individual families or owned collectively.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual128,Spirit Writing Seance,"The Spirit Writing Seance

The whole reason for being of the cult is to communicate with the gods, the representatives of the Jade Emperor's celestial bureaucracy. The gods are not only the source of moral law, but in their administration of that law are able to influence man's fate. A man may therefore hope that if the gods will intercede for him then his fortunes may be improved, his sickness healed, and his life lengthened.

The means for communicating with the gods is provided by the seance. In the course of a seance, the cult member or other supplicant can ask direct questions of the gods about his own fate or the fate of others. A seance can include visits from more than one god, especially if the business at hand is especially complex (calling for various special skills not likely to be possessed by a single god). The mediums can also relieve one another if the session is extended or if the presence of a god known to be especially close to one or another of the mediums is desired.

Seances are held at regular intervals ( Chi-Jih ). In the case of the temple at Pearl Mountain Village the second, twelfth and twenty-second days of each lunar month are regular seance days. This has not always been so, and in each year the days when regular seances are to be herd are always newly assigned or reconfirmed. Seances will also be held if there is some emergency or especially pressing business. Normally permission to hold an emergency seance is asked by ‘casting lots’ first ( poah-poe ). ‘Casting lots’ is done by means of ‘moon stones’ ( poe-a ), which are two blocks of wood or bamboo carved in a half-moon shape, one side flat and one side convex. A question is put and the two blocks are thrown on the ground. If both blocks land convex side up, the answer is indeterminate. If both flat sides are up, the answer is no. If one flat side and one convex side are up, then the answer is yes.

The reasons for holding seances are as many as the problems of life in the village. Sickness is definitely the most frequent problem dealt with. But practically any issue can be put before the gods. A name for a new child, the date for a wedding, a name for a business, a propitious day to build a pigsty, investment advice, help in getting rid of ghosts, instructions on digging up grandfather's bones, helping in finding missing persons, all of these are legitimate personal concerns that may be laid before the gods for help and advice. Besides these private matters, the gods may give gratuitous advice concerning morality, life-style, or anything else. This may be addressed to the community as a whole, a specific group, or some one individual. Public matters such as the order of ritual events or the celebration of calendrical festivals are also placed before the gods for their decision.

A typical seance takes place in the evening. I will describe one that took place in the village temple on June 3, 1973. In the early evening several members of the cult are sitting in the temple office. These are early arrivals who have come to the temple as soon as they finish dinner. It is the twenty-second day of the fourth lunar month, a day on which a seance is regularly scheduled. The village head of Lower Pearl Mountain Village arrives. At the last seance held in the temple he had been appointed by the gods to supervise the construction of a new Earth God temple in the village. He and several other villagers had spent the day going from place to place looking at Earth God temples to get some ideas about how to construct the new temple. He was worried because they had not yet decided on the exact dimensions although the gods had already designated a date to break ground. He engaged the other men in discussion about their opinions on the size and cost of the new temple.

Several minutes later another man came in, carrying a newly carved statue of a god, the Emperor of the Dark Heavens ( Hsuan-T'ien Shang-Ti ). He planned to install the statue on the altar of his house. He put the statue on the desk in the middle of the group for everyone to inspect. He is immediately asked how much the statue cost, and everyone agrees that US$ 30 is a reasonable price. One man criticized the statue's carriage, saying that the carving was very nice but since the Dark Emperor was a military god, the statue should be more lively. This one, he said, was too stiff and rigid in its pose and the god was sitting too far back on his chair. A military god should be poised on the edge of his seat, as though set for instant action. Yes, someone else chimed in, and the sword should be lifted up more as if to strike.

The man who had brought the god statue was concerned that he hadn't made advance preparations for the statue's ‘initiation’ ( K'ai-Kuang ). Normally when a new god statue is to be initiated, advance notice is given to the gods by writing out a petition and leaving it in the inner sanctum for the gods to look over. He had not done this because he had some personal reason for wanting the god installed in his house in a hurry. So he asked the spirit medium if he thought it would be all right to initiate the statue anyway. The medium said that it would probably be all right, to take the statue into the main hall and put it on the altar there, then ask the gods when they came.

By nine o'clock thirty or forty people had arrived at the temple. Some of them were cult members who had definite tasks to perform, such as setting out the evening offerings of fruit and flowers and tea for the gods. Others, especially women and old men began chanting sutras in the great hall. Still others had taken their station in the scriptorium, where they were writing down the questions that the now steadily arriving supplicants wished to put to the gods.

In the office, the medium got up, took a blue robe off a peg on the office wall and began to put it on. This was the signal for several of the men in the office to get their own robes down and start to dress. Word was passed to the back room on the other side of the temple where most of the cult members were sitting, and they too began to dress in their blue robes. These robes are one sign of membership in the cult and also have a purifying effect on the wearer. All persons who enter the inner sanctum must wear one.

The medium and the assistant medium along with a dozen others enter the great hall. They take their places facing out of the main door. Seven sticks of incense are lit, handed to the medium and the assistant, then passed out through the central door to another man. He steps into the courtyard, recites a formula, then tosses one stick of incense into the air. The drums beat and the gongs sound. The incense passes back inside and is placed in the incense pot. The spirit medium and the assistant kowtow nine times. Then they and several others enter the inner sanctum, which is then purified by burning spirit money. All women members remain outside in the main hall; they may not enter the inner sanctum under any circumstances.

The medium and the assistant take their positions holding the peach branch over the tray of sand. All the cult members in the inner sanctum begin a chant to purify the premises and invite the gods to appear. After a short while, the peach branch begins a subtle vibration, trembles, and begins to make wobbly circles in the air. The stylus falls down with a thump onto the sand and begins to trace out circles. Two cult members standing under the eaves begin to beat a salute on the bronze bell and huge drum suspended there. The god writes out his name and title on the sand planchette. Another salute is given and the seance begins in earnest.

First the god composes two four stanza poems. These poems what are called Ch'uan-Shih-Shih , or ‘poems to instruct the world.’ When the god indicates that he is through writing poetry, the recorder reads it back. By tapping the peach branch on the sand tray the gods indicates that the poem has been transcribed correctly and he is now ready to take care of other business. First the man who is responsible for building the new Earth God temple says that he and others on the committee have gone to look at several temples around town. They would like to make the temple as imposing as possible, so even though the god had previously given them some dimensions for the construction, would it be all right to change the size of the temple if they wanted to? The god replies that the dimensions that he had given were only suggestions, and if the people wanted to build a bigger temple it was certainly all right. The man then reads off a set of measurements that he has brought with him. The god is silent for a minute or so as the peach branch circles in the air above the sand tray and then the god questions the measurements for the front portico. The man gives them again, and after another short wait, the god tells him that they should look into the matter of the porch a little more thoroughly, and that he does not want to give approval right now for the new measurements. First he will consult with another god who is a specialist in geomancy. The man thanks the god and steps back.

The next order of business is announced by the god himself. He writes that he will initiate the god statue which has been brought to the temple for that purpose. He questions if all the paraphernalia have been provided. Yes, he is told, a white cock, a mirror, and a new writing brush are all ready. Still in trance, the medium puts down the peach branch and leaves the inner sanctum, returning into the great hall. He stands in front of the altar table, facing toward the inner sanctum. On the table in front of him is the new god statue, its head covered with a piece of red cloth. With no preliminaries, the medium picks up the writing brush and calls for the white cock to be brought to him. As the medium grasps the head of the chicken and bites its comb to draw blood, another man steps up to help. He chants an incentation as the medium opens the eyes of the idol by dotting them and all the seven orifices with a brush dipped in the blood of the cock. He then writes ‘charms’ ( hu-a ) on the statue's back and on the mirror. The god statue has now been infused with ‘spirit’ ( ling ) and is occupied by a god. It has soul. Helpers come up and take it to rest on the higher altar (altar B) with other god statues there. After a few days the owner will come to take it home.

The medium now returns to the inner sanctum, where he takes up the peach branch once more. The god again directs the next order of business: the resealing of a fate. Every person has a unique identity, based on the year, month, day and hour of his birth. In the traditional system of calendrical calculation, each year of the sixty year cycle is ruled over by a different ‘Lord of the Year’ ( Tai-Sui ). An individual born in a certain year may ‘clash’ with ( Ch'ung ) the Lord of that year, and thus make it necessary to ‘hide his fate’ ( kham un ), to avoid any unpleasant fate which might be in store for him. In this particular case, a man's fate had been ‘hidden’ earlier in the year, but it was felt that some mistake had been made and that the measure had been ineffective. So the gods were being asked to ‘hide’ it again this evening. The ‘fate’ was in a small ceramic jar, represented by a few grains of rice and beans, a few small nails, a coin or two, and a piece of red paper with the year, month, day and hour of birth of the individual written on it. The jar was covered with a piece of red cloth over the mouth, tied down with 12 strands of black thread. Pasted across the top was a ‘seal charm’ ( hong-hu-a ) made of a strip of yellow paper with a ‘charm’ written on it. A bamboo incense holder was tied to the side of the jar. In this case, the fate was thought to have escaped from the jar, thus allowing the Lord of the Year to see it and to make trouble for the involved. As a result, the man had become ill. The god directed that the seal and the red cloth should be removed and the jar placed on the sand planchette. The god used the peach branch to write a lengthy charm over the open mouth of the jar. He directed that the red cloth be re-tied, and while this was being done, the god called for the ‘red pen’ ( Hung-Tsu-Pi ) helper immediately took a writing brush which had been dipped in red ink and attached it to the end of the stylus. The god called for strips of yellow paper about an inch wide and six inches long, to be placed on the sand tray. He then wrote out three charms on the yellow paper with the ‘red pen’. These charms he had pasted over the top of the cloth covered jar to ‘seal’ ( Feng ) it. The peach branch (now bereft of the ‘red pen’) was used to trace another ‘charm’ in the air over the jar. The god wrote out a single word of dismissal -- on to the next item.

At this point the ‘recorder’ breaks in with a request. He had been to work up in the mountains all day the day before and when he came home he had a kind of fainting fit; his breath felt cold and he could feel the pounding of his heart. The god told him not to worry, as this was not a matter of mortality. The god calls again for the ‘red pen’ and makes several charms for the recorder to drink.

One of the other men speaks up on the behalf of someone in the village who has not come that night. He says that this man's family is suffering from ‘lack of peace’ ( bo peng-an ). He gives no further indication of the nature of the problem. The god is silent for a few seconds, the peach branch tracing a wobbly path in the air. Finally the god replies: “My investigations show that it is a matter of the Kitchen God being ‘restless’ ( put an )...I find that this man must wait until well into spring before gradually things take a turn for the better. But even then, he must be very cautious during the seventh and ninth lunar months. I will give him some charms. The first should be used to pacify the Kitchen God (*i.e., be pasted up in the kitchen beside the god's place over the stove). The second should be taken to the local Earth God's temple and there burnt in the incense burner. At that time the god should be asked to help explain the trouble. The third charm should be burnt, the ashes infused into water, and drunk. This should cause a change in the situation. But if not, then the man should undertake a ‘Dissipation of Disaster’ ( siau-tsai ) rite.” These directions were copied off by the recorder and a copy given to the man who had asked the question so that he could take it and explain it to the man whose family lacked peace.

Now that all the men who have come into the inner sanctum have taken care of their problems, those of people who went to the scriptorium are taken up. Each case has been written out on a form printed up for the purpose. The name, age and residence of the supplicant are written down, along with whatever problems or symptoms are being submitted for consultation. These are read off to the god in the inner sanctum and disposed of one by one. As each case is completed, a runner takes the transcript of the seance you get up in the morning and also one when you go to bed.

4. Q. I have just had an operation. The incision drains and I have dizzy spells.

A. Your fate is not good. Here are some charms. Drink one once a day. Also, here is a prescription for some herbs. Make a potion of them and drink it.

5. Q. A man wants to build on to the back of his house. His son is getting married and there is not enough room to accommodate the new bride.

A. The 27th day of the 4th lunar month will be all right to start work on the addition.

6. Q. A son is getting married. We wish to make over the ‘earnest money’ to the family of the bride. Would you suggest a day?

A. The 5th day of the 5th month is appropriate. After about an hour, the first medium and his assistant are relieved by the other medium and his assistant. There is no need to go through the ritual of invitation, since the god is already present and the new medium is immediately possessed. The work on the caseload continues until all are finished. At this point the god announces that he is retiring and the drums and gongs are sounded to speed him on his way. Firecrackers are set off outside the temple, the medium and his assistant lay down the peach branch on the sand tray and all leave the inner sanctum. They kowtow in the great hall, ending the session. The cult members either retire to other rooms in the temple or leave to go home.

After taking off their robes, some of them sit around talking for an hour or so, if it is not too late. On this evening, one man tells a story about the place where the man had performed the ‘strawman rite,’ mentioned during the course of the seance. A village a few kilometers away had built a temple to the Earth Gods picking up stones lying around the area to use in the construction. One of these stones happened to be an Earth God image from an older temple that once had been there. Because he was not worshipped any longer, the temple had fallen into ruins. This stone image was inadvertantly incorporated in the foundation of the porch of the new temple without the people knowing it. Soon after the new temple was built and a new god installed, people in the area began seeing the image of an old man, half naked and clothed in rags, who appeared on the porches of houses at dusk and at dawn. Frightened, they went to a temple in a nearby town where there was a spirit writing cult. They found out that the apparition was the old Earth God who was in torment after having been discarded, neglected, and his image put in such an uncomfortable and lowly place. So the people dug up the porch, found the image, and agreed to construct a new residence for him around the hill from the other new temple. This explains why there are two big new Earth God temples right together in that village.

The recorder points at another cult member who is nodding and obviously very sleepy. “Hah,” he says, “You know why gentleman Lau is so sleepy. He was out at the temple at Southside Mountain till four in the morning. The ‘shaman’ ( tang-ki ) there has been holding Court of the Dead sessions ( phoa* sam-se ) and everyone in town is running out there.” Now since the village temple is a spirit writing cult, it is not the best form for one of the cult members to go to another sect which uses shamans as spirit mediums. Court of the Dead sessions are interviews with dead souls, through the medium of interrogation by the Judges of the underworld. These sessions often explain why calamity or suffering has descended upon someone whose conduct in this life should not call for such punishment.

In this case, Gentleman Lau was quick to protest that he had gone on behalf and at the behest of his sister, who has a mentally retarded boy and was seeking the reasons for her son's affliction. But everyone got a good laugh out of the slur on his loyalty to the cult. In fact, it is not uncommon at all for people to divide their loyalties between different cults, especially when some other cult is popular and efficatious in some respect.

About this time, the temple keeper comes in and tells everyone that it is time to eat. The fruits, candies and wine that were set out for the gods at the beginning of the evening have been gathered up and are now set out for everyone to eat. These tidbits are quickly gobbled down, with much commentary on which are good and which bad. Mainly, sweet is good and sour is bad. After eating, everyone goes home. Only the temple keeper is left to pick up the fruit skins and banana peels and sweep the floor of cigarette butts. Then he closes up the doors of the great hall, turns off the lights, and goes to bed himself. Night closes in.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Ritual129,Ritual during pai-pai commemoration of deity,"In midmorning, the lo cu and a few assistants enter the temple of Tho Te Kong to formally invite him and his spouse to come out and enjoy their festival. His consent to being moved about is sought through the medium of the divining blocks. Persons coming into contact with the images are careful to have purified themselves ritually before they approach. Gods almost never refuse to come out when asked, as they enjoy their rare respites from duty as much as people do, but the permission should be sought as a matter of courtesy.

Unlike the tradition followed in some paipai, including that for Wen Cu Kong (described later in this chapter) a spirit medium (tang ki) is not employed to determine an auspicious time to bring out the god and begin the opera. People say that Tho Te Kong is a familiar (and perhaps lowly) enough god to be asked in the simpler manner. Some informants were of the opinion that Tho Te Kong never speaks through a human medium--he does not have the power to possess human beings characteristic of higher gods.

Having arrived at the temporary shelter, the gods are placed and incense lit with a minimum of ceremony. It is important to burn incense at once to purify the shelter of any taint which the still unsettled gods might resent. Although there are general rules for the placement of the images--the left side ranks higher than the right, and a position higher or further back on the altar is more honorable than a low or forward one--much of the arrangement is guided by aesthetic considerations, the intent being to make an attractive and symmetrical display. Tho Te Kong and Tho Te Bo are joined by a few smaller images which normally stand with them on the altar, and by household gods from local families.

After the gods have been set in place and flowers, fruit, candles, and incense offered, it is necessary for a responsible person to remain in the shelter at all times. This is less a ritual requirement than a precaution against meddlesome children or strangers. As older people like to gather in the shelter to observe and comment on the preparations, there is usually no need to appoint particular persons to watch over the gods. When necessary, some old person will stay nearby until informally relieved by another, a rare example of completely informal cooperation.

The only ritual specialist whose services are employed during this paipai is an elderly Taoist practitioner. He performs a brief ritual in the temple itself, the central act of which is the reading aloud of the entire list of contributors to the opera fund. The name of the household head or person in whose name the contribution is made is mentioned, and the Taoist specifies the number of persons in the family, plus the number of hoped-for members signified by extra donations. All other details of the management and expenses of the festival are read, and the accompanying ritual ensures that the information will reach the ears of Tho Te Kong so that supernatural credit will go where it is due. The Taoist is paid a small sum for his services (NT 120, U.S. $3).

This important ritual is not considered an interesting one to watch. As its performance requires no participants but the Taoist and his young apprentice, no one else has any reason to be present. Many people of long residence in the community have never seen, or, in some cases, heard of it. This is a good illustration of the Taiwanese attitude toward Taoist and Buddhist religious specialists: one pays them to perform a task which one cannot do oneself, and that is the end of the affair. No reverence or special respect is shown them; it is rather like hiring a plumber.

It is customary for the opera to begin at about 2:00 in the afternoon. The play is preceded by a curtain-raiser of impersonations of gods of Longevity, Fertility, Official Preferment, and Wealth, and as this sacred portion of the entertainment ends, the lo cu or his wife sets off firecrackers and burns gilded paper money. Children used not to be allowed to watch the “gods” perform, as it was thought too “strong” for them, but now no one restrains them. The cheerful sounds of percussion accompaniment and firecrackers soon attract a crowd of several dozen persons who chat, buy delicacies from vendors, inspect the gods in their shelter, read the list of contributors, or just relax in rented chairs and watch the play. The afternoon spectators are mostly the old and the very young, but as evening draws on, school children and then husbands and sons join the crowd, and housewives complete the food preparation which has occupied most of their day.

Once the cooking is done, the mature women load an attractive selection of three meat dishes and wine, incense and spirit money into baskets to carry to the shelter. A woman unpacks her basket onto a table in front of the alter, lights three incense sticks to signify that the offering is made to gods, not ghosts or ancestors, and with its fragrance calls the attention of the gods. While these sticks burn, the housewife lights others, placing them in the god's incense burner, prepares and burns spirit money and firecrackers, and prays for the health and prosperity of her family in the coming year. A prayer is prefaced in orderly fashion by the recital of the name of the official head of the supplicant's household (usually her husband or father-in-law), the woman's own name, their address--complete with street and number, Neighborhood, Section, and City--and with the inevitable plea for pieng an, an undisturbed life. Women may take advantage of this occasion to teach their toddlers to offer incense and bob their heads in prayer; it is thought to be charming to see, as well as good for the child. Sometimes an older child or husband comes to help if the offerings are heavy, but this is primarily a woman's duty and privilege. When the incense from the first three sticks is consumed, enough time is adjudged to have elapsed for the essence of the food to have been eaten by the gods. The offerings are then repacked and taken home for consumption.",0,0,1,0,0,0

His daughter, Yasaa,   sits at the side, responding to the cues Mèjugo gives her in the ritual invocations with an appropriate “eeee” or “mmmm.” The sacrifice is being carried out on her behalf because she is still not pregnant after several years of marriage. Not only does she really want children, but her marriage will be in jeopardy without them: she will even have trouble leaving her parental home for her husband's. Today's sacrifice is by no means the first related to this problem. One indication of its persistence is the presence of a statue showing a woman kneeling with a child (e.g., Fig. 1). Mèjugo has placed it next to the altar, an earthen cone that is kept under or beside the bed inside the house. He has taken two altars ( omono or ama in Dogon ) out into the compound, one for himself and one for his daughter, dusted them, and prepared them for the ritual by smearing them with fresh mud and circling them with a special twig covered with chewed charcoal. An old, well-worn leather string with a bead, the duge, is placed over the altars, and finally the statue is set next to them. Then the sacrifice begins in earnest.

Mèjugo intones a long invocation to all gods and beings from the Dogon pantheon. This is the toro, the basic text for many Dogon rituals, two stanzas of which have been given above. As he does so, he pours water and rice gruel on the beads, on the altars, and on the statue. The text is recited throughout to the end of the proceedings. No ritual can be carried out without “words” (Calame-Griaule 1965:416), just as no sacrifice can be performed without some kind of altar. In the toro, which is too long to be cited here (Paulme 1940:444-46; Dieterlen 1941:148-52; 1982), the major and minor beings are invoked, ranging from God (Ama, the same word as for altar), through the earth god (Lèwè), to the various lesser spirits, ending with the ancestors, the first settlers, and those people who scaled the cliffs.  Mèjugo normally would have his friend Ani help him with the invocation or with the sacrifice proper. Ani could not come this time, so Mèjugo will have to do it alone. After the rice gruel, he pours millet gruel on the altars and the statue and finally adds a tiny piece of millet cake and some millet mush, a staple food of the Dogon. Now the preliminaries to the sacrifice are out of the way. In this case two chickens are slaughtered above the altars and statue. Mèjugo repeats the reason for this gift to Ama in his invocation: “Do away with the barrenness./ Do not mix the words./ This is the chicken of purification:/for the mistakes,/for the failures,/ for the bad words,/ for the evil thoughts./ Let her be pure,/ forgive us, forgive us./ Please those who have passed (the ancestors),/ do not disturb our killing (of the chicken);/ open the belly,/ let the child enter.” His daughter Yasaa joins in: “All the mistakes of the mouth,/ do not listen to those./ Let our hearts be pure,/ accept our chickens./ Give me the thing I think of,/ look at me at your place (the statue, near the altar)./ Mother (her deceased grandmother), here is your chicken;/ Ama tongo (God Creator), are you there?/ Accept our chickens,/ fill my womb./ Once the Creator has come/ all discussion is finished.”

The little carcasses are plucked and grilled. Mèjugo then puts some liver on the altars and statue: “Here, take the liver, do not take the people.” When the gods have had their share, the remainder of the food is eaten by members of the family who are present: first Mèjugo, then his daughter, and finally the others partake of the mush, the gruel, and the beer.

This case is an example of the traditional use of statues among the Dogon. A figure like the one employed here is both a person and an altar; in fact it represents someone at the altar. In sacrifice it fulfills four functions: to identify the supplicant, to identify his or her problem, to draw the attention of supernatural beings to the proceedings, and to intensify contact. In order to assess the impact of a statue on a sacrifice, let us follow the general procedure for obtaining and using one.

Usually it starts with a problem; illness and infertility are the most common ones. At first sacrifices are performed on the standard altar, without a carved figure. If a solution is not reached, the man or woman in question may decide to have one made. This option is sometimes indicated through divination, either by the well-known method involving the tracks of a fox (Griaule & Dieterlen 1965:160 ff.; Pern 1982:122; Paulme 1940:223) or by the one where cowry shells are thrown. For a small fee, one of the few blacksmiths (jèmèn) able to carve makes the sculpture, indicating the problem it is to address. In principle it should “look like” the client, but in practice faces and expressions are routinely stylized, the style varying more with the carver than with the client. In fact, in some instances statues can be reused by other people. Designation of the difficulty takes precedence over identification of the owner.

The first time the sculpture is used, the sacrifice is performed in a slightly more elaborate way than the one performed by Mèjugo. The procedure for the installation of a new altar is followed, because that in fact is what a new statue is. A new altar is usually erected behind the granary in which it is kept, near the place where its owner washes himself each morning, and if possible under a small overhang. The special feature of the installation ceremony is the blessing of the altar/statue by the lineage elders of the village half, who arrive after the performance of the sacrifice to voice a loud and clear benediction over the new owner of the omono, demanding God's blessings and stressing their own best intentions toward him. Afterward they are given a feast of the millet beer prepared by the women of the household.

The statute, wrapped in a rag, is kept in a trunk inside the house or in a special granary. During the ritual it stays next to the altar and so receives all invocations and offerings directed toward it. When the sacrifice, as I have outlined it, is over, the figure stays there for some time, often for the rest of the day. Even after everyone has left, it remains praying to God, beseeching the ancestors, drawing the attention of the supernatural world to its owner.

The rationale behind the Dogon use of statues is closely interwoven with their belief system and with their system of sacrifice, so a short excursion into this realm is called for. Ama (or Amma), the sky god, is the head of a triumvirate that includes Nomo (Nommo), the water god, and Lèwè (Lèbè), the earth god. He is the Creator, Ama tongo, who gives rain, life. As such he is not an otiose God, for he actively engages himself in the lives of men. All sacrifices and other rituals are primarily directed toward him; his name is invoked in the countless blessings, greetings, and salutations of social interaction. Though Ama is the source of all being, animal as well as human, he is also a major cause of insecurity. He is the god “who changes everything,” as was expressed in the opening stanzas of the toro. The toro dwells extensively on this characteristic: whoever walks on the paths, Amma puts in the bush, and vice versa; he brings comfort to those who grieve, tears to those who laugh.

The other two members of the triumvirate, Nomo and Lèwè, share the ambiguity of Ama, though each in a slightly different way. As the god of open water, Nomo is the most feared of all (Griaule 1948). Conceived as a reddish person (like Westerners!) he lives in any permanent pool of water. Although he descends from heaven with the first rains, he is not so much the rain god, for it is Ama who gives and withholds the rain. (An explicit myth insists on that.) Like Ama, Nomo is a “changer”: he transforms himself into anything red and often something dangerous. A number of familiar spirits are associated with him, of which the binu are the most important, as we shall see.

The earth god Lèwè, who takes the form of a giant snake, has a dominant role in a founding myth of the Dogon, the one about the migration from Mande (Dieterlen 1941:184). He is important through his association with several altars, especially the one associated with the village as a whole. His special priest is the hogon, the oldest man of the village, who bears an important ritual responsibility (Bouju 1984:167). Among his familiars Lèwè counts the atüwünü, small black beings that roam the scree between wards and villages, and who the Dogon say are the oldest inhabitants of the scree. Other associates are spirits belonging to the physical environment, like the yènèü, spirits of the trees, and yèbä, spirits of the bush. (In most of the literature — e.g., Griaule 1938a — these spirits are indicated by their Sanga names, andoumboulou and yeban.) All are considered at once important and dangerous: some major cultural elements, like mask language, stem from them, but the atüu'ünü are also believed to kidnap children and attack people walking alone.

By themselves, the gods cannot be trusted with continuous care of their offspring. They are both helpful and threatening; they give blessings but can also kill people. Yet one has to depend upon these unpredictable beings. The sculptures help in the interaction between men and this ambiguous supernatural world. Though bolstered by his family group, for the most part the individual faces Ama by himself. A statute serves somewhat as an intermediary, addressing the Creator on the supplicant's behalf, directing the gods' attention, which is thought to be of limited span, and refreshing, their reputedly poor memories. As the Dogon say, “One cannot always pray and kneel at the altar, but the statue can!”

Thus carved figures are not ancestors but rather representations of the living. The Dogon do have ancestors — deceased kinsmen some of whom they know by name, but whom they usually address collectively. To some extent, ancestors may serve on behalf of the living as intermediaries with Ama; the toro is explicit about that. Their role in religion, however, is small. The abode of the dead is vague and their place in the lives of their descendants is of minor importance. Rather it is Ama who is addressed first and foremost directly by the living. Characteristically the toro starts with the invocation to the Creator God and only then proceeds to the lower beings. The latter are invoked as separate beings with their own potential for good and harm. The ancestors come at the end of the list; one may ask them to plead with God, but that is not a prominent request. Neither do they receive any special attention in sacrifice or other rituals.

For the Dogon, the statues function in a way similar to that of ancestors in other African religions (Uchendu 1976:291). Yet, one might say that in structuralist terms they are “inverted ancestors,” as their relevant characteristics are exactly opposed to those of ancestors. For example, among other African peoples ancestors are deceased kinsmen who control their offspring, punish or bless them, and have their own well-being at heart together with that of their dependents. In contrast, statues have never lived, and are created and controlled by the living from whom they spring; they have no volition or any goals of their own to pursue.

By the logic that governs this kind of thought process, opposite elements of pairs may serve a comparable function and purpose, but in a different way (Lévi-Strauss 1964:123 ff.). That holds true here. In Afric[unavailable] religions where ancestors are important (thus not among the Dogon), both ancestors and statues intervene between man and the supernatural world. In the case of ancestors, the living apprehend ancestral intervention through misfortune: problems or illnesses are interpreted as corrective measures of the deceased but watchful kinsmen. Though sometimes their descendants may be aware of transgressions, often divination has to be performed to know exactly what has gone wrong. Divination indicates both the diagnosis and the cure. The latter frequently takes the form of sacrifice, in which the ancestors are appeased, put at rest, and reassured of the fundamental allegiance of the living toward the dead. Statues may also be employed in times of stress and misfortune, but for their use no divination is needed, as problems do not originate from them. These figures serve to stir the supernatural world out of its inherent lethargy, into specific action. Misfortune is viewed not so much as a corrective but as the consequence of a lack of attention. Besides, in this kind of sacrifice, it is not the wishes of the ancestors that are heeded, but the aims and goals of the living: statues stress the individual wishes of their owners. As we shall see, the individualistic aspects of the use of these objects almost guarantee that some will be utilized for goals that run counter to the social order. Of course, the aims of the ancestors and those of individuals are in harmony; ancestors are often interpreted by researchers as representations and reflections of the social order (Norbeck 1974:45 ff.; Holas 1965).

Without sacrifice a statue would be a simple baga (piece of wood); with sacrifice it is a dege, the Dogon term for protective statue. It serves both as an addition to the altar in question and as an altar in its own right, filling a special niche in the ritual environment. Dogon villages are replete with altars, their size and location varying from community to community. There is one for each social unit: village, village half, ward, clan, lineage, age group, household, and individual. In addition to these, special altars address specific problems (such as drought or locusts) or belong to specific groups (herdsmen, hunters, etc.). Though the generic name of the altar — in fact, of the sacrifice — is omono, and though each may be termed ama — as a place to invoke Ama — these different types have their own names: for example, lèwè (village altar), pegu (village-half altar), babinu (ward altar), amayèwè (clan/lineage altar). Those for individuals and families are simply called ama plus the name of the person in question. Some of the special altars have their own names. Dogon altars form an open system, the adding of new ones and the discarding of old ones being a normal pattern. The construction of an altar and the performance of sacrifices on it are largely optional. (Only the lineage and clan elders and the ward priests are obligated to sacrifice.)

People follow their own inclinations and respond to their own problems in the performance of the traditional religion.

The same freedom characterizes the use of statues. Most of the altar types do not feature them at all; an earthen cone, some of them portable, is fully sufficient. Statues are used in individual and household sacrifices (like the one I have described), in some lineage altars, and in the ward shrine, the binu-ginu. Most serve in the household setting. The figure is called the guyo togu ama, after the guyo togu, a special type of granary used for the storage of valuables, not cereals. The entry is low and the door rather wide. Old men sometimes live there.

The shrines of the ward priests are the most prominent among the altars featuring statues. In principle each ward house consists of several clans (Paulme 1940: 165 ff.) and is linked to the supernatural world by a binu ginu, the house of the binu. Binu spirits are thought to possess people, at their own whim and at the person's inclination. Those possessed thus receive a call to serve both the binu and their community as special priests or priestesses (respectively binukèju, the “one who accompanies the binu,” and amayanu, the “woman of God”). After passing a test, in which the new priest must find the beads belonging to a deceased predecessor while in trance, the binukèju builds or restores the shrine, a small houselike construction dedicated to these spirits (Fig. 2). A dege statue is often found among the paraphernalia inside (Fig. 3). This cult is sometimes called totemic (Griaule 1938a:267), since each shrine is associated with a particular animal, frequently represented by a figure sculpture. The totem of the binu in Figure 3 is the hyena. Often these statues are very plain, made with a minimum of detail; sometimes they are just one or more uncarved sticks. However, in contrast to the statues for individuals, they may be preserved for quite a long time. In this case their very age is important, as they are not the representations of the binu but rather their resting place; the binu have manifested themselves through these dege. These spirits are closely associated with Nomo, the water god. In some cases Nomo himself is depicted in a sculpture, belonging to such a shrine, as a cross between a crocodile and a man or woman (Fig. 4). Such examples are, however, not very common; people know of only a few places where such a Nomo shrine exists.

Sacrificing on the statue is identical to sacrificing on the earthen altar. Despite the identification with the client, the sculpture, like any intermediary, is subject to the same processes that govern altars in Dogon religion. The major point is that their association with the capricious supernatural world tarnishes them with similar characteristics. Sacrificing on an altar or on a statue enhances its power (panga). A statue that has served for a long time and has been used in many sacrifices therefore becomes dangerous. While its effectiveness grows as well, the negative aspects increase more quickly than the beneficial ones: Ama gets a bit too close for comfort. In the right amount, then, sacrifice is commendable and necessary. In the Dogon view, there should be a balance between need and fulfillment. This notion of balance is central in their social life (van Beek 1983a).

This is one important reason why statues are discarded after they have been in use for a while. They normally do not last a person's lifetime. Of course, if the problem is solved, the dege is no longer needed. Still, as we shall see, many of these sculptures are open to various interpretations and may serve as a multifunctional instrument, a ritual aspirin. After functioning for a period of time, whether the particular problem has been solved or not, the statue is put back in its hiding place. One must respect its power and not terminate its use too abruptly, as total neglect would result in an “attack” on the very people it was created to represent. Sacrifices should be made at gradually decreasing intervals until, at long last, the statue is put at the bottom of the granary or trunk to be forgotten.

The figure then enters its final phase, when it is rediscovered by the descendants of its original user, usually after the owner's death. For them it represents their deceased father, grandfather, or grandmother. At some important ritual moments they may even exhibit such sculptures to show off their “ancestors.” As an example, during the ritual that is called buro (or bulu), which marks the beginning of the rainy season (Pern 1982), statues that have fallen into disuse by the death of their clients may be displayed on the top of the main house in the compound. In a few cases, descendants will reuse the figure for their own benefit; the dege will be considered to represent the new client. Usually, however, the old statues remain inactive. With time, they become associated with the deceased, but in that capacity they do not function in ritual, and they are no longer powerful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual131,Naming Ritual,"Becoming a Character

The most important ritual event is the naming. Dogon have many names, and one of those is given at the end of the period immediately following birth. After thirty-five days the mother may leave the compound and eat and drink together with other people; on the fortieth day she takes the baby to the lineage elder. Presenting the baby to the oldest man of the lineage, the one who inhabits the gina (which signifies both lineage and lineage-house), she gives the old man a small gift and presents him with the child. Seated next to the altar of the lineage, the old man gives the child its gina name and performs one of the many blessings, Ama duwo, with which Dogon social life is so full. Invoking the name of Ama, the high god, he calls down on the child and its family peace, another day of life, and obedience to the elders. It is up to him what name he gives, and it often implies some criticism of his younger kinsmen: such names as ‘The wealth has not found me’, ‘Respect is no longer’ or ‘Forgotten’, say nothing about the child, but bring home to the child's parents an indication of the old man's feelings. He then presents the baby with a few coins. If the mother has some meat, she will give it to the elder. Five days later the baby is presented to the father's parents, and receives their name.

This is in fact only one of the many names that the child receives: any close relative will give a name of his or her own choice to the new arrival. The father gives a name, the mother another, as do the grandparents. Besides these, babies do have a generic name, based on order of birth or special circumstances at birth. Order of birth constitutes a clear-cut system of naming (Bouju 1984: 64), where sex and position in the sequence of the parents' children are the main criteria. However, specific family circumstances suggest a special name: for instance twins have their own names, as children conceived without menses between them and the preceding sibling ( Yakunyu/Akunyu), or - more rare still - girls born or conceived during the sigui festival ( Yasigui). The same holds for twins, whose birth and emergence from the house call for specific rituals. Though many are indeed adressed by these ‘structural names’, many others are not. When older, the person in question can choose a name, which may stick. In the end when the child grows up some consensus may prevail about what their name is, though in many instances people continue to be called different names by different persons. Finally, when reaching the age of marriage, most youngsters choose a tige, motto, as an accompaniment to their name, in which they propound their own view of themselves (de Ganay 1941).

Once born and named, the baby is recognized as inè, a person, consisting of a body ( goju), hakilè and kikinè. The body comes from the father, both other elements of the person coming from Ama (God) and the parents. The hakilè is the most complex concept. Located in the kinè, liver or heart, it may be translated as intelligence, imagination and character. It is the essence of the personality through which one distinguishes oneself from others. All living beings have hakilè, though in widely divergent ways. Whereas the body is for work, for performing physical labour, the hakilè is for staying alive, keeping people together, and remaining part of a social group. Animals have it, the ‘cunning’ ones more than the ‘stupid’: the fox, the black ant ( key), the rabbit, the pigeon (all animals associated with divination) have plenty, sheep only a little. But anyone who can find his way home has hakilè. During pregnancy the child in the womb has the hakilè of both parents, and, as any real inè, may speak with God. At birth, one of the two hakilè is erased and the child takes on the ‘character’ of one of its parents. Though usually boys have the hakilè of their father, and girls the one of their mother, it may cross sexes; Ama decides which one it is to be. As the child in the womb may be a boy, any pregnant woman has to pour some water on her belly before drinking from a well outside the village: as men are stronger than women, the hakilè of the boy may overrule the mother's; if he is not respected as a man, drinking first, he may have himself exchanged for a spirit child.

Not only can one hakilè be stronger than another, but one person may have more of it than someone else. Whoever has a lot of hakilè learns quickly, has a good memory, is able to follow several conversations at the same time, and has a strong sense of fantasy. As social categories, smiths and leatherworkers should be endowed with much hakilè but, according to the Dogon, the bards ( goû) use theirs mainly to trick people; bard status is much lower in Dogon than among the Bambara, Malinke and Soninke. Someone less well endowed has difficulty in remembering and is less coherent in speech. However, ability in speech is not decisive: one deaf-mute in Tireli is generally considered to have plenty of hakilè. People may have a considerable amount of it and still have difficulty in speech: their hakilè is considered ‘short’ ( gele), while someone whose abilities lie mainly in speech has a ‘long’ ( para) one.

Other character traits depend on the hakilè as well: being gentle, quick to react, patient or jealous; a ‘bad’ hakilè leads to jealousy, a good one to equanimity. A witch's hakilè induces them to poison people.

Witches are ascribed another, quite bewildering, trait. Besides administering poison, they roam at night in the bush and leap out on people who inadvertently come their way; most of their victims are thought to be male. Flying through the air with burning sticks in their hands, they land on the victims' heads, sometimes urinating on them, and paralyse them for some hours; but in any event their victims are rendered incapable of speech. After consulting the shamanic priest, a ritual is performed as a remedy, the central part of which is an emetic. The patient is expected to vomit up a hairy worm, after which his tongue will loosen up immediately. Some people are reputed to be stronger than these flying witches and stay on top of them for the whole night. Such a ‘strong man’ will remain a close friend of that particular woman-witch, though she may pass on his name to her fellow-witches, to ‘try him out’.

Male sorcerers, who direct their attentions mostly towards enemies, teach their craft to their sons when very old, selecting the one who ‘knows his words’. Female witchcraft is passed matrilineally, from one yadugonu (witch) to her daughter or younger sister. However, this full inheritance of the hakilè is believed to happen not at birth, but on the death of the old witch, and may result in an unbroken chain of ten generations of witches. Should a mother wish to abandon witchcraft, her daughters would become infertile. However, even with the hakilè of a witch, the assumption of witchcraft is not deemed to be wholly involuntary; witches have to wish to become one. Once they have chosen the ‘path of poison’ ( dugo means poison), and once it resides in their granaries, there is no easy way back.

On the positive side and regarding ordinary people, their hakilè makes some of them inè piru (literary a ‘white person’): open, friendly, hospitable, well at ease with everyone - which, according to most of my informants, is an epithet few deserve. Their opposites, inè ma (‘dry person’) are difficult to deal with, individualists who dislike company. Others have a ‘white liver’ ( kinè piru) and are generous with goods: they make gifts of food to anyone in need. The essence of hakilè, after all is ‘keeping people together’.

The notion of kinè, meaning ‘liver’ but often also used for ‘heart’, is important here. Its general implication is ‘inner person’ and all qualities are thought to reside in it, emotions and thoughts included. In fact, it is also the locus of the hakilè - its point of reference within the body - and often both terms are used interchangeably.

The last part of the inè is the kikinè, ‘spirit’. The term is closely related to kikinu, shadow, but their meanings have now become identical. The kikinè is added at birth, and the person then becomes complete. The kikinè comes from Ama, God, who, according to some informants, must have known it in the way that we know a person. It enters the body, takes on the qualities endowed through the hakilè, and will leave again at death. Meanwhile, the kikinè travels at night, gathering information through dreams (for everybody) or clairvoyancy (in some cases). Though the kikinè is normally invisible, some people have the capability of seeing them ( kikinèyèn).

After death, the kikinè can, and will, return for many years, at least till the next mask ritual, settling down finally somewhere near the village. Indeed, the aim of the mask festival is to send the spirits of the dead on their way to the ancestors, to live with the old ones and, eventually, become one of them.

Once established as a person, the naniyè of the new baby has to be established, the one whose name is reborn. The newly born baby is considered to be the ‘respondent’, the representative, of a recently deceased kinsman or kinswoman, usually a grandfather or grandmother. It is the father's sister ( ninu) who performs divination, asking the cowry shells about the identity of the naniyè. Usually, when five or six years old, the child will be given the duge, ritual beads of its naniyè, to keep, wear at special functions, and use in sacrifice. At least once a year, during the annual sacrificial festival of the buro, everyone will perform sacrifices for the naniyè, lest his or her name be forgotten. Nevertheless, the dead person is not considered to be actually reborn in the young child, neither is the child usually called after its naniyè, though sometimes people may use the kinship term for the older naniyè in adressing the younger one. In order to become a fully-fledged person a naniyè is essential; but in any case, everybody always does have his or her naniyè.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual132,Initiation,"Age Brotherhoods

Initiation is supposed to take place every three or four years. It groups together in one and the same age brotherhood, tumo, all those who have undergone it together. The members of one and the same tumo, in speaking of one another, use the expression mu tumono, my comrade, or mu ane, my friend. 237 Here we again come across the age brotherhoods known throughout the Sudan, Fla-mbolo-lu of the Bambara, Kari of the Malinké (1). Even the term tumo which designates the association seems very close to the Bambara Ntomo, children's confraternity of which Monteil speaks at length (2).

During the seclusion of circumcision, which lasts at least a month (six weeks of five days), the ones circumcised live in close contact with their elders of the preceding class, who watch over them and teach them the songs of circumcision. They stay apart, spending their days at the place where they were circumcised, outside the village, their nights in the house that, in each quarter, is assigned to the ones circumcised. Contrary to what takes place among many other African peoples, the re-entry of the ones circumcised into the ordinary social world does not give rise, in our day, to any particular rejoicing: the boys, clothed in new garments, are brought back to the village by their seniors, at night, after washing at the pool and rubbing themselves with sesame oil; the seniors are thanked for having looked after the ones circumcised, but they are not given any gift (3).

Circumcision is an important stage for the young boy; it marks his departure from the world of childhood. He ceases to be regarded as a negligible quantity; his situation, 238 from the social point of view as well as from the religious point of view, is profoundly changed. From the day of circumcision, writes Desplagnes, “the child is considered a man and has the right to take part in all the duties of the men of his clan; it is the most important act in the life of the natives in the organized black societies … In the mountain massifs of the Plateau of Bandiagara, the young men have the right, from the day of their circumcision, to take part in the political and religious life of the village and of the canton” (1).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual133,Dogon Sacrifice,"Offerings and Sacrifices

The content of the libations varies according to the altar and the rite, on the one hand, and according to the power or the soul invoked, on the other. Most often it is made up of the mushes of small millet and rice and konyõ.

In the blood sacrifices the most common victims are domestic animals, especially the chicken. Sheep, goat, dog, ox (the latter more rarely) likewise pay their tribute.

The technique of the Dogon sacrifice is very clear and precise: the sacrificer starts by alerting the supernatural power by a prayer. He then pours the blood of the victim on the altar, which sends the nyama thus received to the power invoked. The latter then liberates part of its own nyama, which will be deposited on the altar and from there will rise up into the victim, most especially into its liver. The sacrificer, by eating the victim, and in particular its liver, will assimilate the nyama of the power invoked.

On solemn occasions in the past human victims were sacrificed.

Arnaud [B 1] describes a ceremony that was celebrated in the dry season to obtain rain and ensure a good harvest:

In his dwelling and in the presence of the old men the hogon sacrificed a man or a child. The flesh of the victim was mixed with that of a sheep or a goat; all was cooked and then eaten by the company. Copious libations of konyõ completed the ceremony.

Moreover, human sacrifices seem to have occurred until a very recent date. Labouret [B 130] has surveyed a certain number of suspicious violent deaths that took place in the circle of Bandiagara between 1904 and 1927. According to this author, these acts may be related to the ancient practices common in all of West Africa and already pointed out by travelers of the sixteenth century, which consisted of offering human victims for sacrifice.

These crimes against persons about which Labouret speaks were all committed between the months of May and August, that is to say, during the rainy season, and would have coincided with the threat of drought.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual134,Sigui Festival,"Becoming Fully Born: the Sigui

Once every sixty years, the villages in the central part of the Dogon area celebrate the coming of the sigui, an ambulant ritual lasting over five years, in which the lives of the villages are renewed. Each Dogon should at least once in his life have danced or, as they call it, ‘seen’, the sigui. The founding myth starts the story in the village of Yougo, a sacred spot ever since for the Dogon:

Sen Senu, when herding the cattle of his father Sanga Yèngulu and his mother Na Yèngulu, grew tired and thirsty, and climbed a tamarind tree to suck its fruits. The owner came along: ‘What are you doing in my tree? Shall I throw my stick at you?’ Sen Senu, showing no respect, answered: ‘I want to suck them with my mouth, not my anus’. Of course the owner grew mad and hit him. Limping home, Sen Senu's parents asked why he had been beaten and how he had lost the herd. ‘I have been hit by the owner of the tamarind tree!’ His father promised to come with Sen Senu next day and kill the owner. In the early morning, the birds awakened Sen Senu and his father, and they walked to the tree. The owner met them. ‘Why have you beaten my son?’ The owner answered: ‘Because he has insulted me’ and told how Sen Senu in answer to the question what he was doing in the tree, said that he sucked with his mouth, not his anus. The father asked Sen Senu if the story was true, and his son agreed. ‘Please accept my apologies for my son’, the father said. The owner, accepting the apologies, told the father: ‘Climb the tamarind and take whatever fruits you like, or suck as many as you like now.’ The father, with his gun at the foot of the tree, climbed and plucked a number of fruits. From beneath Sen Senu called him: ‘Why do you climb the tree, father?’ ‘The owner has given me fruits for the porridge’. Sen Senu retorted: ‘That is not the way, father. First you come to kill him, now you accept his fruits as a gift. If you act like this, I am no longer your herdsman’. ‘That's entirely up to you, son’. ‘My way’, Sen Senu said, ‘is the way of the sigui, I shall follow the sigui.’ ‘All right, my son, that's entirely up to you!’ So Sen Senu set out alone into the bush, and met someone herding chicken. After exchanging greetings, the stranger asked where Sen Senu was heading. ‘I am following the road of the sigui’. ‘That is a hard road, the road of the sigui.’ ‘Still, I want to try it’, said Sen Senu. Somewhat further into the bush, in encounters with people herding goats, sheep, horses, donkeys and cattle, the same exchange was held: ‘Where are you going?’ ‘I follow the sigui oju’. ‘The sigui oju is a hard one’. ‘I shall try it anyway’. At last Sen Senu encountered an elephant [in some versions a lion]. ‘Where are you going?’ Sen Senu: ‘I follow the road of the sigui.’ The elephant trumpeted: ‘I have the sigui’. Sen Senu: ‘If you have the sigui, then do as you like’. The elephant ate Sen Senu, and for three whole years Sen Senu remained in the elephant's belly. At length the elephant grew thirsty, and set out to drink in a water-hole just outside the village. The animal then defecated, and out came Sen Senu, carrying with him the dalewa, forked sigui stool, the oblong calebash ( koju pom) and the horse tail ( sô duro). Then his sister came along to fetch water. Seeing Sen Senu, she tried to speak to him, but he could not speak. She ran back into the village, and cried out loudly: ‘Sen Senu is at the pool’. Her father thought she was crazy, as Sen Senu had been eaten three years ago, and all mourning had long come to an end. ‘Look for yourself’ she said, and so he did. At the water-hole, his father asked Sen Senu to come home. Sen Senu started to speak in the language of the sigui: ‘Go and brew beer, let everyone adorn himself in his finest; if not, I will not be able to return home. So go and receive me' [in fact Sen Senu gives very detailed instructions on how to brew beer, how to grind the millet, how to gather the firewood and to fetch the water, how to make porridge, how to ferment the beer and how to ration it]. When everything had been done as instructed, the elders came to Sen Senu and asked: ‘Who shall be in front?’ Sen Senu then sang one of the twelve sigui songs, ‘Please forgive me, elders, you are the oldest, but if you do not know the road of the sigui, I am the first, and I will turn to the left.’ The elders responded: ‘Yes, you know the way. Three years is not three days; you have been inside the elephant, you know more than we do.’ Thus Sen Senu came home, and this is the way that the sigui came to the villages.

The ritual takes the form of an ambulatory dance, from a specific water-hole in each village - since it was at a water-hole that Sen Senu was found - then into and through the village. Lengthy preparations are made for this central ceremony; for three months, the ritual speakers for the village are initiated by being taught the Dogon traditions regarding the ritual language ( sigui so), and all men prepare their outfit: long Dogon trousers, the dalewa (Y-shaped stick for sitting on), a shirt bedecked with cowries ( goû kai), pendants in the ears, a special white bonnet ( sigui kukwo), a horse's tail and an oblong calabash. On their faces the men simulate, with blue paint, women's facial cicatrization.

On the morning before the day of the dance, all men, in strict order of age, walk to one public place of the village, where the representative of one specific clan puts some sesame oil in both his ears, to receive the ‘language of sigui’. Also present are the pregnant women, whose bellies are touched with a dalewa so that the baby in the womb will already have ‘seen’ the sigui. After birth, if the child is a boy, he will have to touch the stool with his hand while, in the event of a girl, the dalewa will be thrown away. That night, the initiated boys leave the caverns, to which they have been confined for three months, and sleep out on the dunes.

On the morning of the day of sigui, all the men fully attired throng around the initiates and, whirling their bull-roarers, take them to the water-hole. Some hundred meters before the hole (which nowadays is dry) they release the initiates, who run to the hole, trying to be the first to dip their feet in (which brings riches). Mud from the water-hole will be besmeared on the feet of small boys and the bellies of pregnant women. The men go home, have their hair shaven, take their sigui implements, and return to the foot of the scree, at the ‘start of the village’; here, the initiates await them with their outfit: bonnet with red agates, rich goû kai, a richer decorated kind of dalewa, an oblong calabash with decorations of masks. They have just washed themselves, for the first time in three months, but still have not shaved their heads.

At the foot of the scree the sigui line is formed, strictly following age, the oldest in front (that is to say, the oldest who have not yet ‘seen’ the sigui) and the younger men behind them. The smallest toddlers who can just walk bring up the rear, if they are not carried on shoulders. Accompanied by the village drums, the initiates then lead the way, sounding iron bells. The tortuous sigui route takes the immense line of slowly dancing men and boys through most of the village, passing the major ritual spots, before ending at one of the two main dancing grounds. A long line of beer jars is waiting for the men. The initiates then start reciting the major sigui myth (as rendered earlier) in the ritual language, each recounting how he stayed with his companions in the bush for three months. They express thanks for the food and beer, and may add some general admonitions on how to behave towards elders, kinsmen and strangers. Then, with all men sitting on their stools, the oldest initiate (all of them are young boys!) puts his horse's tail into one of the jars of beer, swings it to the four cardinal directions, pours some beer on the floor, then lets all initiates drink first. General drinking follows, from old to young, though both drinking and passing the calabashes is done with the left hand. As the beer at the dancing ground is finished, the men go home and eat and drink the beer their women have brewed. Throughout, the women, dressed in everyday clothes, have been the main - almost the only - spectators, though they are kept at some distance by the old men who have already seen previous sigui and may flank the dancing line. Usually, however, these men are too old for active participation, and just watch and pass comment on the proceedings. The rest of the day is spent eating and drinking at the home of kinsmen, age-mates and friends.

All girls born during the period of the sigui (from the start of the initiation till drinking is ended) are called yasigui and will perform a special role throughout their life: they are the sisters of the masks. For them the taboo on the masks does not hold; freely mingling with the masked men, they are the ones who fetch them water and bring them food during the days of the dama masquerade (van Beek 1991b: 59).",0,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual135,Dama Ritual Day 1,"Celebration of the Dama

First day. — The first day of the Dama is called warsigiri (5). It coincides with that of the Sanga market.

At sunrise the cry of the masks makes itself heard at Songoulou. It is repeated about 9 o'clock with bull-roarer accompaniment. Shouts and hummings repeat every half-hour.

Toward the middle of the day, while the participants are putting on their costumes, a mulono positions himself on the road going from the village to the shelter and declaims a text in secret language intended to attract the favor of the supernatural powers onto the dancers 

The burning-hot, burning-hot, burning-hot mask is Amma's mask
The mask came from the East to us all, to our village

Mask greeting! May Amma beat down the sorcerers (1) May he give long breath to all men A skillful man went into the bush, he saw a dead tree He took with his hand a lizard on it The lizard lost its life on the mask

The mask became powerful, powerful, burning hot, burning
hot,
burning hot, burning hot, powerful, powerful, burning hot,
burning hot,
To the woman who touches it with her hand, to that woman
there arrives misfortune
They struck a rooster on the mask
The mask became powerful, powerful, powerful like the sun
The mask became powerful, powerful, powerful like fire
The mask became powerful, powerful, powerful, like the assegai
May Amma beat down all the sorcerers
May no good happen to the sorcerers
May evil happen to them
All words are Mouno's words
May Mouno put in our hands good things
May Mounokanna put in our hands good things
May Kannamanga put in our hands good things
May Onowagna put in our hands good things
May Dyonséo put in our hands good things
May Sadyimmé put in our hands good things
May Mouno beat down the sorcerers
May misfortune happen to the sorcerers
May all men put the mask on their heads, put it on their eyes
All, may they put, it on their arms, and well on their legs
Holding in hand the fly whisk may they take the road
May they go to the drums
May the bad things, may the words be shut up in a hole.

After this declamation, another formula is recited for the dead man

bige dyu wüyo boy
man head fall
bige perye nu[unknown]onu (2) komdyu boy
man calabash hand take

In the course of the afternoon, the clans set up the crosse-seats ( dolaba) of the dead on the public square (2).

Meanwhile, the masks of all Sanga-du-Haut make their way to the buguturu altar of Sangabinou (3) to circle around it, and each awa returns to its shelter (4).The wife and the mother of the dead man kneel in the public square near the crosse-seat; a mapuru mask (5) comes out of the shelter on the run, crosses the fields and the village, rushes on the dolabas which he circles around three times and which he tears out uttering the ritual cry, while the mourners wail. He goes back at the same gait toward his comrades and, without entering the shelter where they wait covered by their costumes, he calls them and takes the lead of the column which begins to move slowly toward the 373 dancing place (1).During the ceremonies to follow he will hold the crosse-seats (2).

The masks then head for the Ogotyé locality where they are to meet the awa of the other part of the double village and the one of Barna.

During this move some dancers devote themselves on the edges to various exercises; the mask on stilts, tene tãna, goes and comes on the flank of the troupe, leaning against trees or passing into the fields. Indeed, he cannot be an integral part of the whole group of his comrades because of their too-slow gait which would not allow him to keep his balance. The bambara kade mask, brandishing his throwing-stick and his skin shield, mimes attacks on imaginary enemies.

During this time the Ogol-du-Haut masks go out of their shelter (5:30 p. m.), go along the kolyana locality to assemble there, pass behind the Tabda altar of the goatherds, and arrive (5:40 p. m.) on the crag of Ogotyé where, dancing in a circle, they wait for their Ogol-du-Bas comrades who are progressing toward the village (3). That far the marching is kept in rhythm by the kagãdige battery. Before arriving at the boundary of the locality, each column splits: one part of the dancers continues its march toward Ogotyé, the others, the ones who were not present at the last Sigui, that is to say the youngest ones, go back to the shelter to deposit their costume and come back simply as spectators to attend the progress of the ritual.

When all are assembled (5:45 p. m.), the file of men goes around the place three times to the warsigiri boy rhythm and finally forms a circle in the center of which the different masks carry on their respective parts. Then the dance becomes general (5:50 p. m.) and the people without costumes mingle with the others.

When the tumult reaches its highest point (5:55 p. m.), all those present form a circle kneeling down. A blacksmith mask goes around the group brandishing the crosse-seats of the dead men concerned, while a notable ( mulono) or an Initiate recites the part of the myth relating to the teaching of the secret language to the goatherd (verses 475 to 641). A

When the recitation is ended, all go in a line (6 p. m.), to the 374 warsigiri boy rhythm, downward from Ogotyé onto the rocky esplanade of kilikili (1). They dance under the baobabs to the rhythm of the same name (2). While the whole seated assemblage forms a circle-arc open toward the base of the Ogotyé crag (6:05 p. m.), two masks begin to run in a circle. To the rhythm of the drums and upon a general shout, all stand up then sit down again except two drummers who begin to twirl around.

At that moment, bede masks carrying the crosse-seats of the deceased (3) approach a rock situated on the northern part of the esplanade and named labadugo dumo, “stone of the masks”. Holding the crosse-seat vertical, they strike the rock with the heel of the handle. With a second shout (6:08 p. m.) all get up and, to the warsigiri boy rhythm, go in single file to the tummugo locality, cemetery of the crosse-seats (P1. XXX, B), which is characterized by a fault in the rock on which people dance and which forms a kind of step, one lip of the break being higher than the other. The uncostumed men, who have gone ahead of the masks, jump this step individually, each one going back to his place toward the one following him who towers over him by the height of the step. He then performs several dance movements as if he wanted to forbid the other from jumping. He finally gives way and the next man acts the same way (6:12 p. m.). The file of masks follows that of the dancers without costumes and devotes itself to the same procedure (6:20 p. m.). When the whole assemblage has crossed the step, the crosse-seats are deposited not far away (6:30 p. m.) and the masks, each in his turn, do a dance in place before going back separately into the shelters.

Lastly, the samana, having kept out of the way, gives himself over to a grotesque pantomime consisting of crossing the step again, which he does with many difficulties. His spear- and saber-play, his agitation when he has fallen on the ground excite general hilarity. In time, he returns to the village (6:40 p. m.).

When the rock is empty of dancers, an Initiate declaims, in front of a few who are present, a text in secret language on the dolaba which he circles. As soon as he finishes (6:46 p. m.), the drums beat the sigi meli then the gona (6:47 p. m.) and the assemblage breaks up (6:49 p. m.).

When all the dances have been performed and the masks put down in the shelters, the men gather on the main square (1) to drink the beer prepared by the dead men's families (2). In the evening, the crosse-seats having been moved and put near the mask shelters, the uncostumed men go to dance at all the houses of the dead men. During the entire night they chant the gummo wolo accompanied by drum beating.",0,1,0,1,1,1
Ritual136,Dama Ritual Day 2,"Second day. — The second day of the Dama is called gondenu (3). Before sunrise the masks come to the dead men's houses to the boy dyamu rhythm. They climb up on the terraces to dance the endye kom, “crow of the rooster” (Pl. I, A), punctuated by the hand-clapping of the dead man's mother (Pl. I, B) or the widow and by the songs of the men remaining in the courtyard or the nearby alleys (Dog.):

endy[unknown] kom v[unknown] kwa [unknown] dojaba mo ya [unknown] The rooster utters his cry For me it is day. kamma pęlu ulu dyãngul[unknown] a yeluguwo sa In Pélou of Kamma the children were elegant. Who has not seen them destroyed! (4) key dala ula and[unknown] ginę omo sa The ants have gone up on the man's terrace His house is destroyed (5).

During the dancing, encouragements in secret language are expressed. According to the strength of the bearer and the violence of the wind, the sirige stays in the courtyard 376 or goes up on the terrace (2), while his companions perform their dances. Next, the procession makes its way to the main “square” where, after three turns executed to the odu boy rhythm, the masks present their dances in the following order (2) ( cf. p.376 and refer to the chapter on Dances).

After the dances the masks go back into their respective shelters where the costumes are put down. The men then come back to the square, where a distribution of beer takes place.

Who gets to drink first is of the utmost importance. The order in which the drinking is done recalls the bonds which unite some members of human society with the snake ancestor. At the time of distribution of the beer, the most aged of the old men commands the youngest of the notables who have seen two Sigui to go to notify the guides, giritõ, charged with going ahead with the business. He mentions that a first part will be set aside for the Great Mask, a second for the old men who have seen two Sigui, a third for the Initiates ( olubaru) since it is understood that the latter figure in this distribution as respondents, nani, of the snake. No allusion is made to the people who have seen only one Sigui, but their share is nevertheless anticipated in the sense that they will drink the rest of the beer.

This beverage is furnished by one of the clans in mourning. The giritõ have the entire amount of beer carried to the main square by village people, not without having set aside their own share which remains in the houses.

First of all the pots are divided among the villages of the region (Sanga-du-Haut). Next, as far as the Ogols are concerned, an old man chooses a man from each of these localities who carries out the apportionment. The distributors first set aside the old man's share and give smaller and smaller quantities for those following. One pot is reserved for those who helped the dancers dress. The first one to drink the beer must be the oldest of all the ones who celebrated the last or the next-to-last Sigui in the area where the Dama is celebrated (3).

When only a single calabash remains, it is offered to those who have not yet received any and they drink in turn.

This distribution is made out of gratitute to the Great Mask for having come to greet the dead man and also to thank the dancers who are going, immediately afterward, to go to the houses of the dead men singing and dancing to a very slow rhythm (Dog.):

and[unknown] solugu gadu[unknown]ga

yoyo geb[unknown]nga (bis)
geb[unknown]nga de solugu gadüiwo
[Before] the father speaks it is forbidden [to sing]
I shall say [before] the father speaks it is forbidden
[to sing]
I shall say yo yo (twice)
I shall say [before] the father speaks it is forbidden to

When the procession enters the dwelling, a mourner intones (Dog.):

yaya lumiwo bamma gode [unknown]
girimo di balubalu
Although I do not want to cry
The tears flow from my eyes.

To this chant those arriving respond (Dog.):

House destroyed, who will rebuild it
He left the house destroyed

When all are assembled at the house and while the drinking continues on the square, the following chants are intoned (Dog.):

Begining with the arrival of the mourners, the drums and part of the men go up on the dead man's terrace continuing the chants or others of the same type (Dog.):

yago bego tudo womo won tudo Pay him for the dance he held yesterday, pay him! key tõndo [unknown] dala ula [unknown] ba [unknown] sa key tõndo [unknown] dala ula [unknown] ende key [unknown] dala ula d[unknown]r[unknown] gin[unknown] sa ende key [unknown] dala ula The column of ants has gone up on the terrace The column of ants has demolished the father's house, has gone up on the terrace They are ants which have gone up on the terrace Have demolished the father's house They are ants which have gone up on the terrace (2).

The dancers descend from the terrace going on with their chants. Without entering the house of the dead man, they go to drink beer in the courtyard.

About 3 p. m., according to the ritual of the morning, the masks, preceded by men without costume, come back to the main “square” and to the dead man's terrace on which they dance while those who are below chant (Dog.):

March on the road zigzagging Masks, as soon as you have gone out. He has his father no more. Move yourselves! Masks! Move (1)! I drank your beer, O rich Pala (2)! I remember yesterday I drank your beer, O rich Pala!

During all these chants, the masks are interrupted and encouraged in secret language:

awa puro puro yeni boy
mask eyes eyes beautiful
awa puro puro duno boy
mask eyes eyes big
awa puro puro ĵeĵana
mask eyes eyes burning hot

The eyes of the mask are beautiful eyes
The eyes of the mask are big eyes
The eyes of the mask are burning-hot eyes.

This rite performed, the assemblage goes to the main square where the same exercises as in the morning take place, with participation of all the Sanga-du-Haut men who arrive by quarters (1). As soon as the first of them arrive, the masks stop their dances, the sirige performs his, and all return to the cave. During this time, the masks from the other villages, after going around the main “square” three times, go to dance on the dead man's terrace. When they arrive, the relatives intone the following chant (Dog.):

e

The presence of the masks on the terrace does not last long. They soon come back to the main “square,” where the dances continue until 382 sunset. Then the costumed visitors go under a nearby overhang and undress in order to participate in the drinking.

When the beer has been distributed among the various villages according to their importance, each group drinks separately. The dignitaries' beverage, specially prepared, is distributed as was done in the morning. When night has come, before the departure of the outsiders, the old men go around the “square” three times (1) preceded by the drums, while the following chant is intoned (Dog.):

Ritual137,Consecration of the Great Mask,"Carving and Consecration of the Great Mask

After the harvest and about 4 months before the festivities they proceed in each village (single or double) (2), to the carving of the Great Mask. For this purpose, about ten men go into the bush to get a suitable tree, ga (Ficus) or togodo (3), which they fell after taking certain precautions intended to protect them from the nyama of the wood (Bk. VI, chap. 2, A). The trunk is then brought not far from the habitations (4) where, during about a week, skillful Impure ones who were present at the last Sigui proceed with the carving or 179 give directions to younger artisans. From the whole length of the trunk is disengaged a flat and tapered snake whose rectangular head is pierced by two eyes (1).

From place to place in the high part of the pole isoscelestriangular holes are made, very variable in number. They are supposed to serve as passage-ways for the wind so that it will not overturn the piece of wood at the time of the funeral ceremonies during its erection beside the dead man's house.

On the forehead of the mask between the two ears an iron hook, gobo, is driven in, which has received a special consecration on an altar of masks (Bk. V, chap. 1) and which is intended to give to the wood a supplementary force drawn from that of the altar.

During all these operations, an old man recites the part of the myth relating to the discovery of the fibers by the Andoumboulou (Myth, verses 184 ff.) and to the ancestor's death in his snake form (Myth, verses 408 ff.).

The finished pole is painted with black and red triangles with the help of the colors usually utilized for the decoration of masks (Bk. Iv, chap. 2, A); to the red is added a little ocher earth on which sacrificial blood has flowed. After that operation, a fiber bracelet is attached to the extremity of the pole which is then consecrated in the presence of the future Initiates whose entrance into seclusion coincides with its being put in place in the rocky shelter.

For this, the new and the former poles are carried into the mask shelter of Ogol-du-Bas (2) and placed one against the other on the altar built for the occasion (3).By this contact the new support is put into the most favorable position to receive, at the time of the sacrifice, the soul ( kikinu-say) and the force ( nyama) contained in the other. Then they cut the throat of a chicken and a dog which have been bought with the help of a sum of cowries levied on all the participants in the festivities.

Since the dog is a dangerous animal to kill, his movements are restricted with the help of a piece of wood which goes between his legs and is tied to his back and withers. Besides, an assistant of the sacrificer holds him with a slip-knotted rope around his neck while he is knocked on the head by an aide (Pl. XXVIII, A). It is only when he is 180 obviously incapable of reacting that his throat is opened (Pl. XXVIII, B) so that his blood will flow on the masks. The following prayer, in Dogon language, is pronounced at that moment by an Initiate:

Au masque trouvé grâce aux Andoumboulou The mask found thanks to the Andoumboulou Trouvé grâce aux Andoumboulou Found thanks to the Andoumboulou Nous faisons boire l'eau à leur chose. We give their thing the water to drink.

(To the Initiates):

“Du masque prenez l'eau et donnez “From the mask take the water and give Voici la poule, prenez et donnez Here is the chicken, take and give Voici le chien, prenez et donnez Here is the dog, take and give Le masque ayant pris et bu, When the mask has taken and drunk Asseyez-vous comme hier (1)” Be seated like yesterday (1).”

(To the Mask):

“Les Initiés durant trois mois “The Initiates during three months T'ont gardé”. Have watched over thee.”

(To the Initiates and the Mask):

“Joignez-vous “Be united Voici le Gyinou levé Here is the Gyinou raised up 181 Voici le [génie] Sintandou levé Here is the [genie] Sintandou raised up Contre l'homme (1).” Against man (1).”

The liver is then taken, pounded with salt and pimento; the mixture thus formed is finally thrown on the hook which received the blood. Then the chicken's throat is cut and it is subjected to the same operations in its turn. The victims' bodies are thrown into a fault in the Sisongo locality where the fibers of the Ogol-du-Haut masks are made; this abandonment of the sacrificed is intended to give more efficacity to the sacrifice.

They then proceed to the renewal of the mythical action which consists in making the nyama of the ancestor (verse 691) pass into the rock. To do this, the shelter's painting ( bammi) representing the Great Mask is refreshed if need be and the head of the wooden snake having been put into contact with it, a notable pronounces the following orison:

dyu sagya degu wana boy
head put house come back
awa da[unknown]u bige duno awa tunyo boy

The purpose of all this ritual is not only to make the ancestor's soul, which must leave its former support in bad condition, pass into the new wood, but also to attract the souls of the Initiates consecrated at the last Sigui and dead since. After drinking, these souls impart to the new mask some nyama intended to reinforce that which already resides because of the presence of the ancestor's soul. And, as a precaution, people they sacrifice on the wood a gannu sunono, a kind of lizard which is believed to possess a very powerful nyama (1).

By the sacrifice of the dog and chicken, and since each participant has contributed toward the purchase of the offerings, the generation whose first Sigui it is is bound to the new Great Mask and is obliged to furnish it with sacrificial animals and libations until the following Sigui, which will mark the relief effected by the generation to come.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual138,Installation of the Sau Chief,"Installation of the Sau

The following account is given of the installation of new Chief as Roko Sau. (See also 7, p. 70.)

The family of the Vuanirewa make kava; Tui Mereke strains it. There is no singing; the kava is merely taken up to the chief. The two Ramasi, that is the Lord of Tumbou and the Lord of Nasangalau, tie a piece of bark cloth ( masi ) on Roko Sau's arm. One of the two, or else the Vakavanua or the chief of Nukunuku admonishes him and the people of Lakemba that he should be loved, that what he says should be accepted, that they should hearken to what he says, that he should be good to the people of the land.

No one may come in during the ceremony. On that day and for four days afterward no crying or beating of bark cloth is allowed. Every day they bring in feasts from all the villages. He stays in the house for those four days; this is called tonivaki [a term also applied to the staying in after a funeral. After four nights he goes to bathe; a feast is then held called the bathing feast.

Another informant says the retirement lasts for eight days and a man of Katumbalevu proper claims that it is the function of Katumbalevu to rise after the drinking of the kava and tell the Sau “They give all things into his hands and he must be good to the people.”

So long as the chief is only Roko Sau the people of Naiau bring him the first fruits of every kind of food.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual139,Kava Ceremony,"Kava Ceremony

Kava drinking is part of all important ceremonials. It is indispensable in rites connected with the chief--his death, marriage, circumcision; the reception of a visiting chief; and the building of a chief's house or canoe. It always precedes a feast ( mangitchi ).

Kava root is a valuable object of ceremonial exchange. It is in great demand, for kava is scarce on the southern islands where it is rarely planted and must be imported from other parts of Fiji. When a stranger arrives in a village he presents ceremonially a whole fresh kava root to the hosts. Dry kava roots are substituted when the green plant is not available. Kava is never prepared and drunk without ceremony, which is elaborate in the presence of a chief. Kava ceremonies vary slightly on different islands and for different occasions. In southern Lau on formal occasions a mixed Tongan and old Lauan kava ceremony is used. On less formal occasions a simplification of the Tongan ceremony is customary. The natives say that the Lauan ceremony is long and is marked by much hand clapping, whereas the Tongan ceremony is short and simple. The Tongans say, “Faka sinisini ko Fishi. Sa levu na topotopo” (Too many tens in Fiji, too much clapping), meaning that the Fijian ceremony is too elaborate.

The kava ceremony for the chief of Kambara is as follows:

The kava drinkers sit cross-legged in circular formation called yalofi , in the following order: the chief sits in the center of the upper end of the house. On his left sits his herald, on his right, another chief or herald. The clan elders sit in two rows on either side of the chief. Those of highest rank sit nearest the chief. At the lower end of the house, opposite and facing the chief, sits a young man who is the kava maker ( palu yanggona ). In front of him stands the kava bowl, which is a wooden bowl ( kumete ni yanggona ) made of greenheart, usually with four legs. The bowl used for a chief has cowry shells tied to the sennit string handle, which is stretched toward him. It is tabu to use this bowl except in kava ceremonies for the chief. In olden days, according to the natives, an earthenware kava bowl without legs ( ndari ni yanggona ) was used.

On each side of the kava maker sits a young man, called assistant at the bowl ( nggaravi kumete ). The young men who pound the kava sit behind the kava maker. Either green or dry kava is used, but natives say the green root makes a drink which is more tasty and digestible. A flat stone slab is placed on a kava mat ( yambe ni yanggona ) and when the root has been pounded with a rough stone hammer into bits, the stone slab is tiled so that the bits of root fall on the mat, the mat is passed to one of the assistants, who slides the kava bits into the kava bowl. Occasionally a wooden mortar and an iron pestle are used.

Formerly kava root was chewed by youths. The kava chewers ( matha ) sat behind the kava maker. They were young men of rank related to the chief. The chewed root was removed from the mouth and placed on the strainer ( i vauvau ), composed of strips of the inner bark of the Hibiscus tiliaceus (vau) , which lay in the bowl; or it was passed to one of the assistants, who put it into the bowl. The kava maker and assistants chewed also. (Old men who have chewed kava in their youth seem to have better preserved teeth than those who have not chewed it. Chewing has been forbidden by the colonial government.)

When sufficient kava has been prepared the kava maker raises the bowl by the two rear legs and says, “Kawa nai mama” (The kava is chewed).

The herald answers, “Kuo holo” (It is kneaded), and the kava maker lowers the bowl. The herald adds, “Tukuwatu” (put it down), and the kava maker puts the bowl down. When it is resting on the ground the herald says, “Tutumalie pe kae palu” (All right, mix). The kava maker places his hands, fingers together, palms down, on the sides of the bowl. The herald looks at them and if they are not clean he says nothing and the kava maker is replaced by another. If they are clean he says, “Palu, tafoki kimoua” (Kava maker, turn), and the two assistants move forward to the bowl. During the mixing and serving they face the bowl, otherwise they face the chief.

Then the herald says, “Lini o ma wai” (Pour the water). The kava maker places his hands in the bowl and the assistant who is sitting on the right of the kava maker pours water from the water container onto the kava maker's hands. It is poured away from the kava maker. It is tabu to pour it toward him. Either a bamboo water container ( ndangoni wai ), imported from Viti Levu, an earthenware pot ( kuro ), or an imported bucket is used.

The kava maker mixes the kava. Before straining it he squeezes the mixture over the bowl to show its consistency and color. The herald judges it. If more water is needed he repeats “Pour the water”, and more water is added. If it is satisfactory he says, “Lele” (Good). Then the kava maker begins to strain the mixture. If he squeezes with the right hand he keeps the left elbow on his left knee and vice versa. It is tabu to raise the elbow above the knee while squeezing. If this tabu is broken, he may never make kava for the chief again. It is very tabu ( tambu sara ) for the kava maker to straighten his legs or to shake the strainer while straining. He passes it back to be shaken out.

When the kava has been strained the kava maker coils the strainer, passes it around the bowl and claps on it two or three times. He says, “Maa e kawa ni” (This kava is clear). The herald says, “Fakatau” (Wring it out). The cup bearer ( vakatau ), a young noble, who has been sitting behind the bowl, comes forward and squats in front of and facing the bowl.

The drink is served in a highly polished cup ( mbilo ) usually made of the pointed end of a coconut shell. The chief has his own cup which is tabu to all others. The cup bearer holds the serving cup over the bowl with both hands, his fingers on the outside of the cup. The kava maker squeezes some kava from the strainer into it. When the cup is full, the cup bearer lifts it with arms extended shoulder high. Then, still in squatting position, he turns. He rises to a standing position, walks slowly toward the chief, kneels with one knee ahead of the other, and fills the chief's cup, which the chief holds toward him with one hand, the index finger extending over the rim of the cup. The chief drinks the kava in one draught. Meanwhile the cup bearer returns to the kava bowl and places the serving cup beside it. Then he takes a cup of water from the assistant, and, facing the chief, stands before the bowl. The chief, after drinking, puts his empty cup down in front of him and the herald says, “A matha” (It is empty). Then all the members of the kava circle clap with hollow hands crosswise ( thombo ) but not in unison. The chief spits toward the side wall of the house, drinks water offered by the cup bearer, and spits again. The cup bearer returns to the bowl and sits down, cross-legged, in front of it. He claps two or three times. The members of the kava circle clap only after the chief has drunk. All the drinkers except the chief clap before receiving the cup.

The cup bearer picks up the cup and holds it to be filled a second time. When it is full he turns as before, and, holding the cup with arms either extended or slightly bent, he stands up straight and faces the chief. The assistant says, “Kawa kuo heka” (The kava is taken up).

The herald replies, “Aui e ma--” (Take it to so-and-so). The recipient claps two or three times, receives the cup, and drinks from it. The cup bearer returns to his place in front of the bowl but does not clap. When the man finishes drinking he throws the cup toward the bowl on the mat in front of him. The cup should not be spun.

The cup bearer and usually the kava maker and assistants dress in ceremonial attire. They wear long pieces of Fijian barkcloth around their waists and wreaths around their necks. They oil their bodies and paint their faces black.

The order of drinking depends on rank and often does not correspond to the order of seating in the kava circle. The herald decides the order and calls out all the titles except that of the chief. When the chief has drunk, the herald who is not calling drinks, then another chief, then the second herald, and so on. The chief of Kambara says that formerly if the high chief came to Kambara he sat in the place of honor and the chief of Kambara prepared the kava. The chief of Kambara's herald sat next to the chief, and the envoy to Lakemba directed the preparations and called the order of drinking as follows: the high chief, the high chief's herald, the oldest man, the chief of Kambara, the envoy to Lakemba, and so forth.

After the first round of kava, when all the members of the kava circle have drunk, the cup bearer returns to his seat behind the kava bowl, and claps two or three times. The herald decides when the second round shall be served. He says, “Fakatau” (Wring it out), and the ceremony is repeated.

All kava which has been prepared must be drunk. When the last bowl has been drunk the kava maker coils the strainer and claps on it three times. The members of the kava circle say, “Malo a vala yanggona” or “Vinaka a vala yanggona” (The kava is well made). The men sitting behind the bowl come and take it out. Then people in the kava circle may leave.

On Namuka kava songs ( meke ni yanggona ) are frequently sung during the kava ceremony. I was welcomed to the island by a kava ceremony. A cup bearer, dressed in ceremonial attire, served the kava. After the first cup had been filled at the kava bowl, he began a series of jerky movements, a sort of dance in time with the kava song which was being sung, and slowly arose facing me. He then walked to me and served me.

The kava song follows:

Mothemothe ni mbongi ka singa vaka, | Sleep at night till daylight,
Singa ka sa tangga nai langi, | The sun is up in the sky,
Laki thavu mai na yanggona me na kari, | Kava root is dug and scraped,
Ra tau ya no i mba ni langakali, | To be laid on the langakali branch,
Tanoa ka laveta i thake, | The bowl is lifted high,
Vakarau na yanggona sevuraki, | Prepare the kava to be refined,
Sevuraki ka kere tu i langi, | The sound reaches the sky,
Langi a nonova, | The heavens are watching,
Mothemothe nggai singa a vanua. | Sleep till daylight.
Kathivi andi ka laki kumbunya, | Call the lady who has gone to the other side,
Sa singa rarama na vanua. | For it is now daylight.
Mbasu na waka me tou nggunuva, | Break the kava root and let us drink here,
Livi na kena wai mbulambula, | The water poured in is quite clear,
Wai sevu ma kere savuya, | I can hear the sound of it again,
Kena kambisa koto ma na utha. | Like the falling of gentle rain.

In southern Lau the kava meke is found only on Namuka but meke are often danced between rounds of kava.

A Tongan custom occasionally observed in Lau is the wase ni yanggona (kava feast). While the chief is drinking, a feast is prepared for him, usually by his younger brothers and parallel cousins. The food is served during the kava ceremony to the kava circle. When the food is ready the herald chooses two men from the circle to divide the feast. The young men sitting behind the bowl carry in the shares. The best share is given to the chief, the next to the herald, and so on according to the drinking order. The feast is eaten in the kava circle and the remaining food removed. Those sitting behind the bowl go outside to eat.

The procedure is simple on less formal occasions, such as marriage or death feasts for individuals in the village. The kava is prepared either by young men or by girls. Sometimes the kava maker and the cup bearer are girls and the kava chewers are men. In olden days kava was prepared and drunk by men only. Today it is occasionally drunk by women in southern Lau. The assistants at the bowl are frequently absent. Occasionally the bowl has several legs or no legs at all. It is not raised for inspection by the herald before water is added, the hands are not examined, and the mixture is tested, after being strained, by being poured into the bowl from a raised cup. The tabus pertaining to the straining process are not observed, and the drinking order is not fixed, nor is it called by the herald. The men in the kava circle usually smoke between rounds. To light his cigarette, which is leaf tobacco rolled in a dried banana leaf ( suluka ), each has placed before him a burning brand.

Occasionally a few individuals hold a kava party in the very early morning called pongipongi . Lauans say this is a Tongan custom.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual140,Feasts,"Feasts

Every important ceremony is marked by a feast, which is presented by one group to another, divided into shares, and distributed according to rank to both recipients and donors. Feasts vary in size and quality of food according to the rank of the recipients and the resources of the donors. Food for most feasts differs from that of the daily meal only in the larger quantity for each individual and in the addition of a sweet pudding for each. Communal fishing which provides fish for the feast usually yields more and larger fish than are caught daily by the women. Turtle and pig are great delicacies served only at important feasts for high ranking persons. Turtle is considered the most chiefly food.

In Lau important feasts are steamed in the earth oven (pl. 2, A ) by men, while small feasts, eaten in the morning, are boiled by women. In contrast to the daily use of the earth oven in Lau (p. 153) it is used only for feasts in the interior of Viti Levu.

The cooked food for a large feast is placed on the village ceremonial ground or outside the house of the recipient and is presented according to the usual ceremony (pp. 65-66) by one of the donors. A small feast is divided outside the house of the donor. Coconut leaves are spread on the ground and the food from the oven is piled upon them. Freshly plaited coconut-leaf baskets, one for each household, are arranged in a circle around the food. The food is shared according to households and distributed by the host. At a large feast the food is distributed according to clans under the direction of the chief of crops or the chief of the ceremonial ground. True food ( kana ntchina ), namely garden produce, is distributed first, then puddings, fish, turtle, or pig. Pots of boiled food, covered with slightly dry breadfruit leaves, fastened down by tying a piece of pandanus around the rim, are brought by the women from the kitchens into the circle. The boiled food is either wrapped in leaves and put into baskets with the steamed food by the men, or is left in pots to be distributed with the baskets. The rank and size of the household and its relationship to the host determine the quantity and quality of its share.

The food in the baskets is covered with leaves (hibiscus, banana, breadfruit, ti). The shares are then delivered to each household by young men related to the host. The food is distributed to the members of the household and eaten quickly and informally. Sweet puddings are eaten first, then the main part of the feast. Guests from other villages often carry their food home and eat it in their own village. Shares for visiting guests with canoes are delivered to the canoes. Frequently the shares for close relatives in nearby villages are set aside and delivered.

The chief or person of highest rank always receives the first and best share of a feast. Cooked food presented to the chief or other high persons is covered with green leaves as a sign of respect. Large fish and turtles are wrapped in breadfruit, banana, or ti leaves and steamed in the oven. The head is preferred because it contains the mana and is therefore served to the person of highest rank. Formerly the head of the turtle or pig was eaten by the chief only. Now, in accordance with the Tongan custom (Gifford, 9, p. 125), the back is eaten instead and the priest receives the head.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual141,Kato nda,"Feces of the infant are wrapped in tapa and kept in an excrement basket ( kato nda ) which hangs on the wall of the house where the child lives. This is done because they are a part of the child and removing them would cause the child to have diarrhea. For the first child the basket must be kept 100 days, after which the father throws it over the reef into the sea. The spot where it sinks is marked with a tabu stick. Nobody may fish there until the ceremony, called mangitchi ni ona singa , is held when the child is one year old. If the father erects a tabu stick he is obliged to give a big feast when the tabu is lifted. The feast adds to his prestige and to that of the child. If the parents cannot provide food for a big feast, they simply throw the basket into the sea without declaring a tabu. The excrement basket for a subsequent offspring need be kept only until the child shows he is gaining strength, usually two or three months. It is discarded in the sea without a tabu. This custom of kato nda which is common on Fulanga is not found on all the islands.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual142,Mangitchi ni ona singa,"A feast called mangitchi ni ona singa which is held when the first-born is one year old, is not held for subsequent children. If the child's parents are prominent this is a large feast, marked by an affinal exchange of property. The child is bathed in the sea for the first time on this day. The ceremony is divided into two parts, the “bathing” and the “drying” rites. The bathing rites ( mangitchi ni sili ki wai levu ) are held on the beach by the women of the mother's clan. The mother's older sister, who is in charge, collects property ( i suai ni sili ) from the mother's clan, bathes the child or chooses another woman to do so, and distributes the portion of the singa feast which is eaten by the women on the beach. The father's older sister, who has charge of the drying rites, collects property ( vaka mamatha ) from the father's clan. Parents of the child receive no share of this property which is ceremonially exchanged and divided between the relatives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual143,Funeral,"Death

Dying or fainting is expressed by thimba . A man who is unconscious is said not to perceive his soul.

A dying man is dressed in a shirt and white kilt. Of old if he was a nobleman the house would be filled with his train. As the dying man's eyeballs begin to turn upwards the people press down the eyelids. This is called vakandromuthi (cause to set).

Of old they sometimes called back the soul (yalo): “Tiosese, eh! come back, come back.” This was termed kathi yalo , calling the soul. Some came to life again.

Not until the man is dead do they wail. I once was present at the death of a child: there was not a tear or a sob. As soon as the child had expired the body was brought out to be photographed, it was then wrapped in oiled bark cloth; then the wailing began as if by word of command. The wailing of the women is loud and vehement, “Woe is me! my child!” 25 The men wail, but in low tones. Only the close relatives wail in the house upon the death of a nobleman. A noble youth then comes and blows a conch, and the wailing ceases, though weeping may be done quietly. The conch is blown that it may wail. A nobleman who wants to wail does it by blowing a conch. It is tapu to wail; only the conches may wail. For a Tui Naiau of old there were ten to thirty conches which were blown without ceasing day and night, the men relieving one another until the burial. For Ratu Finau's little daughter three or four conches were blown inside the house; heard from outside the dissonance of the low toned conches produced a most gloomy effect. If the deceased is a commoner the conch may not be blown; they only wail, but not continuously.

The following information was received from various informants:

The wailing is a signal for the kinfolk to bring bundles of mats to prepare the dead man's couch. When Isoa was dying two Tongan. brothers brought theirs before he was dead, and laid him on their mats that he might die on them. After his death his widow, prepared another set of mats for the body to lie on. Inside the clan each individual, including the widow, provides one bundle, if he can; others only provide one for each family ( yavusa ). The widow may decide that her bundle of mats shall be her husband's couch. When the late Tui Naiau died the couch comprised three sheets of a hundred pieces ( lautefui ). Tongan fine mats ( kie ni Tonga ) are used as pillows. Ten to fifty sheets of Tongan bark cloth of the kind called ngatu tasinga are wrapped round the body under the armpits and covering the feet. The arms are extended alongside the body.

Each bundle consists of ten mats rolled up with a sheet of black bark cloth inside, for black bark cloth is used for a nobleman's funeral. Any one who brings a Tongan fine mat wraps it up in a cloth; it is tapu to hold it unwrapped ( taura wale nga ). If it is a noble funeral ( putu vakaturanga ) the Roko Sau will send a bundle, perhaps come himself; or if he does not the Randi Naiau will go and announce, “The bundle from Great House.” Other nobles also send bundles. Bundles come from Tumbou proper and the various villages that are related to the deceased; only the deceased man's kinfolk come. The relationship may be roundabout; thus Tumbou once sent a bundle because the deceased wife's daughter's mother and Tui Tumbou's mother both came from the island of Matuku. The mats that are not to go to the grave are not placed under the body but put away near the couch at the end of the house.

These bundles are called kissing gifts ( i rengurengu ) because after putting down the gifts the donors kiss the deceased. Inferiors kiss the hands or feet according to their rank; if higher still they kiss the face. If the deceased is a Tui Naiau they will kiss his hands or his feet, not his face. Only true kinsmen kiss. Only one will kiss from each group of gentlemen that comes; thus the Tui Tumbou will come with his people and kiss but his people will not kiss. Those who come for the kissing wrap an old tattered mat round their waists, or wear black, a sign of mourning worn as long as the mourning lasts. Whale's teeth are the kissing gifts of those who bring small gifts; the dead man's near kinsfolk cannot bring whale's teeth; they must bring bundles: these are the gifts proper to a death; a stranger in the village may bring kava. The whale's teeth are merely pushed forward towards the owner of the house; they are not offered up in the usual style. When mats are brought the “owners of the dead,” as the family are called, say “Thanks for bringing the mats.” There is no return made for kissing gifts; they are merely left as love tokens ( iloloma ) for the gentleman. Absent people bring their kissing gifts at their next visit to Lakemba.

Lying in state is described as “lying above” or “at the upper end” ( koto i thake ). From the body down to the middle of the house they lay out one, two, three sheets of a hundred pieces ( lautefui ), but not spread out flat. This is a new custom; of old it was hung from both ends like a screen. It is called kolo , which is the Tongan for a fort or rampart. It is tapu to sit above the rampart or step over it; but one may lie underneath it to keep warm. For a small man there is only one rampart.

Of old, Narewandamu and Tandravula handled the body of the Tui Naiau, anointed it and watched over it ( yandrava ) and kept driving away the flies; they were called sacred hands ( linga tambu ), and might not touch their foods with their hands, being fed or using a fork. At the present day the wife and those who fan the body sit at the upper end.

Women come in to watch and sit at the lower end, all the kinswomen assemble in the house where the body is--a custom called tonitoni . The men remain outside or in a neighboring house, coming into the house where the body is for short periods only. The house where the women assemble is the funeral house ( vale ni putu ). The term putu is also applied to the women in the house; they are more commonly known as the ladies or women of the funeral ( marama, alewa ni putu ). If there are many people there will be several funeral houses. Sometimes an arbor is made outside where kava is made. I have seen no kava drinking or smoking in the house where the body lies. The more zealous women remain awake all night. Food is prepared by the “owners of the dead” for those who come: tea, bread, tinned meat, and kava, sometimes a small pig. Neither in the house where the body lies nor in the annexes is cheerful talk and jesting avoided.

While the body is lying in state and for six days after the burial the land is under an interdict ( tambu ). No noise is allowed or beating of bark cloth either in Tumbou or Levuka; religious music is allowed. The people are said to be in mourning; so I translate the expression tiko vakailoloku . The word i loloku is probably from loku , to appoint, promise, fix a time; it is something appropriated for the dead; it seems to mean primarily something sacrificed to the dead, thus a man killed to honor a nobleman's death; a little finger cut off at death. Formerly if the Roko Sau died they burned one another with brands ( veitavu ); they would gash themselves saying, “Roko Sau, this is a return for the food you gave me on such and such a day.” Those who chewed kava for him came and broke off a tooth saying, “Roku Sau, the day on which I chewed kava you gave me the rest of your food; here is a return for it.” All this is called “doing i loloku .”

Nowadays the burial takes place the day after the death. Or, if the death occurs early in the morning, burial may be made the same day. When one nobleman died there were fifty sheets of bark cloth for strewing the coffin ( i thoni ni kato ); fine mats ( kie ) were put in the coffin with the body as gift for the dead ( i loloku ni mate ). He was followed to the grave by the choir of the Free Church, to which he belonged, and that of the Methodists, singing alternately.

I attended the funeral of the grandchild of Lemaki, the hereditary carpenter (p. 55). The attendance was mostly Tongan. The coffin was wrapped in bark cloth and carried in a mat. After the first part of the service by the graveside, a mat was spread on either side so that half of the mat covered the pit; a third mat was placed over the two, the coffin was placed on the top and pushed down; the mats were folded over it, and the whole was pushed down to the bottom; a few handfuls of earth were thrown, then the service proceeded. At the end of it the women emptied baskets of sand into the grave; earth was thrown on the top and the whole was trampled down. The head should be turned to the east.

The word for grave is mara ; the chiefly word is sautambu , holy chief; no lowborn fellow comes near a sautambu .

If a man is buried on the day he died, the burial feast ( mangiti ni veimbulu ) is held after the funeral. If he is buried the next day, this feast is merged in the death feast called i mburua . At Ratu Isoa's burial feast a pig was killed. All those who attend the funeral get a share, even distant kinsmen may attend.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual144,Circumcision,"Circumcision

I use the word circumcision regardless of its etymology, because whatever may be the differences of technique in exposing the glans penis , it is all one custom and a general term is needed for that custom.

It is called in Lauan teve , but the word is not used before women; in their presence, and in polite conversation, the word sili (to bathe) is used. Women have no scruples about discussing it under that name, though I have not heard them allude to details. Another term is vala , to do, act upon. Women may not be present at circumcision.

In the olden days a boy was grown ( thauravou ndina ) before getting circumcized; some had already slept with women. Now they are circumcized at about the fifteenth or sixteenth year. In the school, boys about ten or twelve started a craze for circumcision. The reason was that being alone in the school they were not bashful as they would have been in the village. Normally the date is fixed not by the boy but by the parents' ability to provide a feast. A noble youth is not circumcized till he is big because a feast has to be made. A noble youth also has other boys circumcized with him, who are called i loloku , a word also applied to persons killed at a nobleman's death. One of my boys, Longanimothe, had two i loloku , one a bastard of Vatuwangga, his clan; another an Ono boy who stood in the relation of son to his adoptive mother, whose grandmother was of Ono.

The circumcision is carried out in the bush. The operation can be performed by anyone who has the nerve to do it.

First the dirt inside the foreskin is cleaned out. The operator then takes a flat stick, like a chisel sharpened at the end and winds round it a piece of bark cloth He takes a razor and wraps all but the end of the blade with bark cloth so that it may not slip. The stick is pushed in between the foreskin and the upper surface of the glans; the foreskin is pulled forward over the stick, the glans pushed back, and an incision is made right through the foreskin; a second incision has then to be made in the interior skin as the first incision has not slit it as far back as the outer skin. This Lauan method is called tava sei , slitting, in opposition to the cross-cut ( thembe koso ) formerly used in Viti Levu. When a boy is small it is well to cut just the tip or when he grows up the scar will reach right up to the root, a condition called ranggavula Leaves of kalakalaisoni , in no fixed number, are chewed and the juice is applied to the wound, as a lotion ( indangi ). After the foreskin has been allowed to bleed a little, a few drops of coconut oil are poured onto the wound. Then the glans is pulled out and a leaf of yanggoyanggona is wrapped round the base of the glans, which being slippery prevents the bandage from sticking. The bandage is a piece of bark cloth wound round so as to keep the lips of the wound apart and expose the glans. A loin cloth is then passed between the legs and round the waist to keep the penis pointing up. When passing water they are obliged to turn the penis upside down to prevent urine from touching the wound and causing inflammation.

There is a feast on the same day as the operation; it is eaten before the return from the bush. Gifts are also made to the operator on that day. The newly circumcized are confined to the house for four days; they may not go out, except to satisfy nature, lest they have a relapse ( tandoka ). They do not bathe, but may splash their bodies with water. No food is forbidden. Grown men look after the circumcized; they are known as the boys' grandmothers ( tumbundra ). They and the circumcized eat the feasts which are prepared daily by the father and the relatives of the boys.

On the fourth day the boys go to bathe in the sea, throw away the old bandage, and clean the penis. They cut a bit from the stump of a coconut leaf, warm it over the fire, and stroke the wound to make the inflammation subside. Leaves of kalakalaisoni are again used as a lotion. Then a feast, i mburua , is prepared on the shore.

The following ancient custom probably belonged to Matuku:

People would form two parallel lines extending about half a mile from the oven; old men and the circumcized sat by the oven armed with candlenuts or coconuts; young men came running between the two files and were pelted until one of them managed to set foot on the oven.

One of my boys on the fourth day went with his two fellows in circumcision ( i loloku ) to Tumbou for the feast. They were dressed in well oiled bark cloth and necklaces ( i salusalu ) of scented flowers and seeds. Part of the feast was taken to the chief [? nobles] in Tumbou, part of it was brought up to me; there were also mats as gifts, which in this case are called “the seat of the circumcized” ( i tikotiko ni sili ). The feast was offered up in the usual way, after which the boys took off their bark cloth and necklaces and put them on the mats. The bark cloth being oiled was of no use.

When the present High Chief's eldest son was circumcized, he and his companions dressed up and accompanied a big feast. One bundle of mats was provided by Nasangalan, and one sheet of bark cloth ( ngatu ) provided by the ladies of Tumbou, all of which were taken to the native medical practitioner who performed the operation.

After circumcision a boy ceases to sleep in the family house ( vale soso ), but lives in a men's house ( mbure ). He must not henceforth let women see his penis. In old times young men did not put on a loin cloth or have intercourse with women till they had public hairs and beards. Circumcision was the occasion of their putting on clothes.

After circumcision a boy is called a man ( tangane ) and must be grown up in his ways; he must not cry, but endure and work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual145,First Fruits Ceremony,"First Fruits

The ceremonial presentation pattern is a variation on the one formerly used for the offering of the first fruits of the land ( sevu ni vanua ) to the priest at the god house. Today first fruits are presented to the chief. The following ceremony, recorded at Undu, illustrates the pattern.

The chief of crops offers a bunch of coconuts (called i vono ni vanua ) to the chief, who sits in the center of the upper part of his house. It is received by the chief's herald, who sits to the right of and lower than the chief.

Chief of crops: with bunch of coconuts bows at the door of the chief's house cries, “O ... oa” (cry of welcome to chief).

Herald: “Vinaka” (Very good).

Chief of crops: enters in crouching position and sits crosslegged in lower part of the house, facing the chief. The people making the offering enter and sit in the lower part of the house. “Ka vaka vanua, saka” (The offering of the land, Sir).

Herald: “Sa vinaka me i vala mai” (You may present the offering here).

Chief of crops: puts the fruit down, claps twice with hands crosswise, takes fruit, and advances on his knees. When kneeling on his right knee he turns his bent body to the left. When on the left knee he turns to the right. “O ... oa.” He places the fruit before the chief, claps twice slowly, twice rapidly and places his hands on the nuts. “Kotokoto vaka tha saka na kasa mua lala, ai vono vei keimundou a turanga ai vono ni vanua vei iratou a matua. A mbala-mbalavu nonggou yangatha sosoraki thake vakaturanga tu yani ka ndonu ka vu ... ra.” (The young bunch of coconuts, the offering to you, the chief, from the people of the land is poorly presented. The lengthy speech of presentation is offered to you in chiefly fashion with honest mind and that is all). He pushes the nuts forward.

Herald: “Vinaka” (good). He takes the fruit and claps three times. “Um ... ” (a sound expressing that he is pleased and likes the fruit). “Au a taura manda nga ni kamananga vakaturanga ka rika tu mai vei keimundou na matua ka vangara tu mai vei iratou na turanga. Au taura kau masulakina ka ndonu mai thake vua na kalou ka mbalavu tu manda nga nomundou mbula.” (I accept the chiefly offerings which have come from you, the ripe fruits for the chief. I accept them gratefully. May you live long).

Herald: “Mana! E ... ntchina! A ... munduo! (Mana, may it be true, may it be effective!). Claps three times. “A ... munduo!” Claps three times.

The fullest information concerning the first fruit rites was obtained on Fulanga, where Waisea said that formerly there was only one offering, the offering of the fruits of the trees. The first fruits of Muanaithake, Waisea's village, were taken to the god house called Tambanikasanga on the piece of land named Tara Nggilo. The fruit was eaten by the priest and his subclan, which belonged to the Nggilo clan.

Today there are three offerings made to the chief of Fulanga: the offering of the fruits of the trees ( sevu ni vua ni kathu ); the offering of the fruits of the garden land ( sevu ni nggele ); and the offering of fish ( sevu ni ika ).

The chief of crops has charge of the first fruits. The offering of the fruits of the trees is held annually for each of the three most important fruit crops--the ivi (Tahitian chestnut, Inocarpus edulis ), the ndawa (Pometia pinnata) , and the uto (breadfruit). Before the season for each crop, the chief of crops declares a tabu on it. Thereafter no one is allowed to eat the fruit until the tabu is lifted. When the crop is ripe the tabu is lifted by the chief of crops, and the first fruits of the crop are collected from each village on the island. They are taken to Muanaithake and presented ceremonially to the chief of Fulanga by the chief of crops and the chief's administrator. The feast is divided among the clans of the island by the chief of the ceremonial ground. The offering of first fruits is held in the fruit season between February and March. The offering of the fruits of the garden land is held annually for each of the most important garden crops: sweet potato in April, yam in May, and sweet yam in July. The procedure follows the pattern described above. The offerings of fruit and of garden produce are considered the offerings of the land ( sevu ni vanua ).

The offering of fish is not an annual ceremony but is held on special occasions as at the installation of a chief or the death of a high ranking person. The master fisherman sets the days and leads the communal fishing expedition. Standing on the reef, he holds one end of the net, while the chief of crops carries the other end to another part of the reef. No one except the master fishermen and the chief of crops is permitted to speak. and if any man throws his spear before the command of the master fisherman or chief of crops he is disgraced and his spear is broken.

The catch is piled before the chief of Fulanga. The chief of crops sits on one side of the pile, the master fisherman, who is also the herald, on the other.

Herald: “Sa vinaka me vakathombo na ika vei Tui Fulanga” (You may proceed with the presentation of the fish to the chief of Fulanga).

Chief of crops claps three times. “I ... a ...” (Yes). Pause. “Tui Fulanga ika ni rau sa tu. Sa thambe tu mai veta tu nggoli. O mai ika sau sa tu. Sa mai vakathombo veikemu na Tui Fulanga. A mbalambalavu tu kena vosa a sosora ki vakaturanga ka vu ... ra.” (To the chief of Fulanga: Sir, lying before you are the fish caught when we fished today. They are the fish for the chief. These are presented to the chief of Fulanga. I have spoken at length on this and this is all, Sir).

Chief of Fulanga: claps three times “A ... u, a ... u, u ... lia, thika manda ya au mundou tu kuku ndau. A rawa tchiko manda ya veta totoli” (I gratefully accept the fish presented by you, my fishermen. May your fishing expeditions be successful for years to come).

Then all the people clap three times and the chief orders that the catch be shared among the people. The chief of crops and the herald distribute the fish, the largest, the sangga and the ndonu , to the chief. The remainder of the catch is placed in rows according to size and from each row one fish is taken for each clan in the following order: Vunikoro, Rasea, Nasava, Sau, Vandravandra. The master fisherman's clan, Vandravandra, receives the same share as the others; but later the chief's clan, Vunikoro, presents property and kava to the master fisherman.

Turtle, sangga, ndonu , and ndaungava , caught at any time of the year, must be presented to the chief of Fulanga and may be eaten by the people only if the chief gives permission.

Natives say that a fish offering is occasionally presented to the high chief at Lakemba as a form of tribute. When a large catch is made on the island the men hold a meeting at which the chief of Fulanga presides. If an offering to Lakemba is decided upon, baskets of fish are loaded onto canoes and taken to Lakemba about 60 miles to the north. The sailors go to the high chief's house in Tumbou and announce their arrival. They then unload the canoes and carry the fish to the envoy to Fulanga of the Vatuwangga clan. He divides the offering into three parts: one for the high chief, one for the chief's household, and one for himself. The shares for the chief and his household are taken to the ceremonial ground in front of the chief's house and presented ceremonially. The envoy to Fulanga and the high chief then give a feast ( i nggaravi ) to the sailors.

In the bush near the village of Naivindamu, Fulanga, a mbau tree, which belongs to Lingau clan, is fenced with a stone wall and called mbau ni sevu . The fruit of the tree is tabu to all but members of the Lingau clan.

On Ongea the main offerings of first fruits are held annually for the mangrove ( Rhizophora mucronata ) and the yangai . The yangai is ripe in June and July. The offerings are presented to the chief of Ongea. Formerly every turtle caught was also presented to him, but today this custom is not regularly observed.

On Kambara in olden days the offering of ndawa , Tahitian chestnuts, and breadfruit was presented to the chief of Kambara. All turtles caught were presented to him also. Today first fruit offerings are presented only when the crop is particularly good. The chief of crops sets and lifts the tabu. In April, while I was on the island, an offering of sweet yams was made in Tokalau. The men of the village collected sweet yams from their gardens and took them to the chief of crops, who examined them. After they had been steamed in the clan earth ovens, the chief of crops presented them to the chief of Kambara and the village headman jointly. Afterwards the food was divided and eaten by the village.

On Mothe an annual offering of first fruits is held for breadfruit and Tahitian chestnuts, and an offering of garden products for yams, sweet potatoes, and sweet yams. The offering was formerly presented to the priest, but now it goes to the chief of Mothe. From each clump of banana trees the uppermost ring of the first bunch of the season is given annually to the chief. Each season the first cluster of fruit from each ndawa tree goes to the chief. He also receives all turtles, all ndonu and all sangga fish caught by the Mothe people.

On Namuka the last offering was held several years ago. They stopped the tabu because they had plenty of food.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual146,"Ceremonial Exchanges, Solevu","Ceremonial Exchanges

Large competitive ceremonial exchanges ( solevu ) are made according to a definite ceremonial pattern based on the sevusevu rites which were formerly used to make offerings to the ancestor gods but are now used to present first fruits to the chief (pp. 65-66).

On Kambara a solevu with deferred payment is occasionally held between the rival villages, Tokalau and Nggalinggali, and between Undu and Lomatchi. Each village tries to outdo the other in quantity of food presented. Several months or years may elapse between the initial payment and the return payment.

The following description of a competitive exchange with immediate payment, held in January 1934, between Komo and Muanaithake was obtained on Fulanga.

The exchange was initiated by the Komo people who sent a message to Muanaithake by a visiting Muanaithake man, asking that a solevu be held. The Komo people stated that they wished wooden bowls, a small canoe, paddles, chickens, mats, and pandanus, and that they would bring manioc. A village meeting was held in Muanaithake and the proposal was accepted. Work began on the articles, and four months later a group of Muanaithake men went to Komo on the Fulanga cutter. The Komo people gave a feast called mangitchi ni veikandavi . The Muanaithake helped the Komo people cut manioc in their gardens and after two days, returned with some of the Komo people to Maunaithake. When they arrived the veikeudavaki ceremony was held in the house of the mbuli Fulanga (headman of Fulanga district). First a ceremonial presentation was held; kava was presented by Komo and accepted by Muanaithake. The Komo men said they wanted to make a little solevu and they discussed the plans. A Komo man was sent to tell the rest of the Komo people to come with their property to the village, while the mbuli Fulanga prepared two guest houses ( i thili ), one for the Komo men and one for the Komo women. A small feast ( i takitaki ) was presented by the chief of the ceremonial ground to the Komo men in the guest house. The men ate first, then the women and children. The chief of Komo and the chief of Fulanga discussed the solevu in the chief of Fulanga's house and then decided to begin the ceremonies on the following day. That night the Komo men and the Muanaithake girls gathered in the men's guest house and the Komo girls and Muanaithake men gathered in the women's guest house for kava drinking and a meke (dance).

Early the next morning the chief of the ceremonial ground of Fulanga took a banana shoot ( vu ni vuntchi ) to the men's guest house, stood outside the door, gave the chiefly greeting ( tama ) to the chief of Komo, and thrust the banana shoot through the door. The chief of Komo, inside the house, unfolded the shoot. (Informants say that the shoot, just beginning to unfold, symbolizes the awakening of the people.) The chief of the ceremonial ground entered the house and put down the stem. He was followed by young men of Fulanga carrying a feast ( i vaka vandra , to awaken), which was presented to the Komo people and eaten by them.

The Komo people took the property brought for the solevu from the guest houses to the village ceremonial ground. This was called i siko Tui Fulanga . First many manioc roots in baskets were placed in a pile. On top of the pile were placed many breadfruit and over all was spread Tongan tapa. The people seated themselves on the ceremonial ground in two semicircles facing each other, the pile of property between them. The chief of Komo knelt in front of the Komo group. The chief of Fulanga sat on a coconut-leaf mat with the chief of crops, tui naro , and the mbuli . Then the ceremony called vakathombo Komo was held. The chief of Komo presented a whale's tooth to the mbuli Fulanga according to the usual ceremonial pattern. The mbuli Fulanga held the whale's tooth, saying, “Ndou a mbula tchiko manda nga na, tui Komo” (May you remain in good health, chief of Komo). He gave the whale's tooth to the chief of the ceremonial ground, who then presented a bunch of ripe coconuts ( i vono ) to the chief of Komo, according to the usual pattern. This ceremony is called vatonakina . Then the Komo girls danced a vakamalolo meke , calied meke ni vakathombo . The Komo people returned to the guest houses and were given a feast, called mangitchi a vua viri by the Muanaithake people. That night a meke was held. While the Komo people were on Fulanga the Muanaithake people prepared a small feast each morning and a large feast each afternoon for them.

On the afternoon of the fourth day the vakathombo Muanaithake was held. A feast called mangitchi ni vakathombo was presented to the Komo people. It was not eaten until after the presentation of property. The Muanaithake men carried their property to the ceremonial ground and piled it as follows: first about 15 wooden bowls and fish plates, and several headrests, then pandanus, and finally a score of rolled mats. Many chickens with legs tied were placed in front of the pile. The mbuli Fulanga stood (he did not kneel because he was the host) beside the pile and presented a whale's tooth to the chief of Komo. This ended the solevu ceremonies.

The Fulanga people won the competitive exchange because the property they presented was considered of greater value than that of Komo.",0,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual147,Name-giving,"Name-giving

After the completion of the third year, a new, important period of life begins. The nursing period is ended, and the child, which hitherto belonged to the flesh and blood of the mother, has become an independent human being. Now it is also given a name, which is taken from the animal or vegetable kingdom. The name is given to the father, when he offers his prayers in snuff-powder intoxication, by the gigantic animal and plant spirits living on high mountain ridges -- hekurá --, who represent the intermediaries to Poré and Perimbó, the joint Supreme Being of these Indians (see pp.197/199). The particular animal or plant whose name a child bears is regarded as a sort of “ spiritus familiaris ” throughout its life. This is linked to the idea that the fate of the child has now become identical in essence with them; that is to say, good fortune, but also the suffering and dying of animals and plants are transferred to the like-named human beings.

The use of animal names corresponds to the nagualistic ideas and customs which Eduard Seler mentions in his monograph 65 on Michuacan /Michoacán/ , while plant names are also included under the same aspect by the Surára and Pakidái. The name “nagual,” according to Seler, is derived from the Aztec word naualli = disguise . In place of nagualism, however, the technical term “tonalism” may also be used (Aztec tonalli = someone's destiny, fate, soul, spirit...) .

On the day of the name-giving the children are given a tonsure such as is worn by all adults of both sexes. It is shaved off with the sharpened side of a split piece of reed ( taquara -- Guadua sp.). Simultaneously they are attired for the first time in the hip cord of cotton or plant fibers, which they may then never remove up to the end of their lives, not even while bathing or during sleep. The cord must, of course, be renewed occasionally, but this is done in all secrecy. At the time of the donning of the hip cord by little boys, the penis is tied up, with the preputium held fast under the cord by means of a loop (Ill. 22). From now on the penis must no longer hang down, for this would be an offense against good form. On festive occasions a belt of cotton is also tied around children (see pp. 64 ff.). A thin cord of cotton or plant fibers, which is occasionally worn below the knees, is supposed to strengthen the legs, and corresponding upper-arm cords, the muscles (in the case of boys) and the arms (in the case of girls). Moreover, small girls wear strings crossed over their chests so that they will have well-shaped breasts later on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual148,Puberty Rites for Girls,"Puberty Rites for Girls

At nine to ten years old, the Surára and Pakidái children have already reached maturity, which is probably related to the fact that these Indians live in the hot, humid rain forests of the equatorial zone. There are no initiation rites for boys. A girl, on the other hand, at the onset of her first period, is kept isolated in a circular pen 3-4 meters in diameter, which is erected a short distance from the maloka ; her entire body is painted with urucú, a red plant pigment. Here the little one must sit motionless and receives only once a day from her mother a calabash of banana soup and a second one of water. In the evening she is brought into the communal house, so that she can lie down to sleep there, but neither parents and siblings nor other members of the tribe may speak to her. The next morning she is put back in the pen. During the second day her mother or another woman applies a pinpoint tattoo above her upper lip, which extends downward on either side of the mouth to the chin. The tattooing instrument is a pointed thorn of the pupunha palm. This is dipped into the dirtygray juice of the genipap fruit, which, after the skin is punctured, leaves a dark blue dot. This procedure is extremely painful for the little girls. Yet they bear it with passive faces, suppress their tears, and do not utter a sound. With this tattooing, all the evil, mysterious forces which are in the menstrual blood, and which might bring danger to the husband, are banished for the rest of a woman's life. With the second onset of the period, too, a girl is again isolated, and after that a small celebration takes place. Later the women do not make any arrangements for concealing the monthly bleeding from the eyes of the other members of the tribe, including the children. They do avoid walking about a great deal during these days, and, if the blood flows too copiously, they sit on the bank of the nearby river or brook.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual149,Funeral,"Death and Burial Customs

As the previous comments have shown, there are neither birth nor marriage ceremonies among the Surára and Pakidái. The social and religious life is therefore dominated all the more by death practices.

If a human being who has completed the third year of life dies, the relatives are inconsolable. There is lamenting in the loudest tones, and the flood of tears among men, women, and children seems endless. Meanwhile, however, the customary occupations are not neglected. While the woman is fetching water from the river, for example, she weeps incessantly to herself and intermittently shrieks loudly; the same is true for the men at their work in the plantings and even for the children at their play. The other members of the tribe cast only an occasional compassionate glance at the mourners, and with this their interest is exhausted.

Immediately after a death it is the duty of the male relatives and 70 friends to fell small trees in the forest, out of which they make a cylindrical wooden frame -- praotimá . This consists of 15 to 20 poles 1.60-1.80 meters long, which are tied with lianas a handbreadth apart. The corpse is slid into this, and liana ropes are drawn over the two open ends so that it is protected from the attack of birds, especially vultures.

Among the Pakidái I was able to be present on the sad occasion of a burial ceremony for the young, vigorous, and happy Hokotómarimá, an unmarried youth whose age was 19 years at most. He had fallen from the top of a pupunha palm ( Guilielma speciosa Mart.) (the liana lashing of his climbing apparatus, see p. 121, had evidently not been firm enough) and must have suffered internal injuries. All the efforts to save him, which were carried out uninterruptedly by the chief and his helpers for two days and nights, were unsuccessful.

After the dead Hokotómarimá had been pushed into the wooden frame, five warriors whose bodies were painted all over with urucú carried him out of the maloka , amid loud lamentations. Two men carried the frame, one in front and one in back; now and then they were relieved by their companions. The women of his kin group, in part with children on their hips or by the hand, accompanied him, amid heart-rending, shrill tones of lament and endlessly flowing tears, on this last journey to the edge of the forest. Then the five men went on alone with the deceased. (The chief did not take part; he would do so only if the deceased were a relative.) After a walk of about 20 minutes, they suddenly stopped, set down the frame, and selected a suitable tree, in order to hang it in the crown. When they had found it, in this case a tall imbauba tree ( Cecropia palmata Wild.) -- tokorí --, two men climbed up, each with two long lianas ( cipó-titica ) hanging around their necks. They chose a particularly thick limb, then lowered the lianas, where their companions tied them to the wooden frame, and pulled it up with the dead man lying in it. When the frame was hanging firmly and securely on the branch, they climbed down again.

Immediately thereafter the five men started back to the maloka . On the way, however, the brother of the deceased cut into a tree, the name of which the deceased bore -- hokotómarimá -- matamatazeiro ( Eschweilera matamata Hub.), with his tercado (large bush-knife) and in the lower part of the truck, deep notches which had the following appearance[unknown] and extended around the entire trunk. This was supposed to make the tree die. If the deceased had borne, say, the name of an animal, it would have been the duty of the brother or a relative to kill such an animal. For, with the dead person, an animal or plant of the same name must also be killed or be made to die (see pp. 138/139).

While the deceased hung in the crown of the imbauba tree, the laments of his relatives in the maloka continued, and even the children did not lag behind their parents in this respect. At night one or two men were always awake, sometimes also a woman, who, at the same time, sang, wept, and intermittently uttered shrill sounds. The sleep of the other members of the tribe, however, was not disturbed by it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual150,Secondary Burial Ritual,"Seventeen days after the death of Hokotómarimá the second part of the burial ceremony began. The male relatives cut down more trees, and, under the imbauba tree in whose crown the dead man hung, they raised a funeral pyre; moreover, they cleared the forest at this spot, so that there was a rather large open area. On the afternoon of the eighteenth day all the Pakidái men then painted themselves with urucú and, under the leadership of Chief Karenauö, singing loudly and weeping at the same time, they went to the place of the dead. All the women and children remaining behind also wept fervently, even the ones who were not related to the deceased. The men carried bows and arrows in their hands; some of them also carried snuff-powder and the tube for blowing it in. The brother, moreover, had the weapons and tools of the deceased, as well as bowls made out of the jamaru fruit -- horotó .

When the procession reached the imbauba tree, two kinsmen climbed up once more and carefully lowered the wooden frame, which was received by the other warriors and placed on the pyre in such a way that the head of the deceased was turned toward the rising moon. The dead man, however, was only a skeleton. The flesh had decayed and fallen through the slats to the ground where the vultures, ants, and other animals had devoured it. The brother put his weapons and tools on the wooden frame, so that they would be available to Hokotómarimá in the realm of the dead. Several pieces of meat, bananas, some manioc flour, and the full calabash of a palm drink were to serve as food along the way.

Shortly before sundown a bright, blazing fire was kindled with the help of the fire-drill, and the funeral pyre was set a fire with it. Then the men blew the snuff into each other's noses, and after a few minutes they were in a state of intoxication, during which they danced, singing and screaming, around the flames that leaped up over the dead man. This was the appeal to the hekurá who are supposed to help the soul of the dead on its journey to the moon (see pp.199/201). The chief uttered his prayers of supplication in a loud voice, and all the other men joined in the chorus. Meanwhile the men kept blowing snuff into each other's noses, so that their ecstasy constantly increased and finally reached an unimaginable climax when the fire took possession of the skeleton. It no longer seemed to be human beings who, howling, stamping, and gesticulating, now stormed around the pyre. They seemed to have taken leave of their senses, and, as a result of the snuff-intoxication, they probably actually were in another world. To me, the sight was like a nightmare and made me think of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch. The wandering of the soul of the dead existing in the bones, accompanied by the tree-soul, had begun, and the hekurá paved the way for them. Meanwhile, night had fallen, and the moon, which I suddenly noticed in the sky in its full size between the crowns of the trees, seemed to be waiting for its new inhabitant. In spite of the heat, which was increased by the fire of the funeral pyre, cold shudders ran down my spine, and an indescribable feeling of terror clutched at my heart. Though I had not taken any snuff-powder at this ceremony, I, too, was in a veritable drunken fever. Never before, neither in church nor in a theater, had I experienced a scene as grandiose as the one here in the nocturnal forest of Amazonia.

This death ceremony continued until dawn. After midnight, however, only a few men, whose duty it was at the same time to keep the funeral pyre burning, were still dancing and singing. The other warriors lay exhausted on the ground and slept. Occasionally one of the dancers was nudged. He got up immediately, had snuff blown into his nose, and danced around the pyre, singing, while another lay down to sleep. Finally, only two men were still dancing and singing. About an hour before sunrise, however, all the sleepers were awakened; they again took snuff immediately, and once more there began a wild dance with singing until daybreak. The death ceremony must be kept secret from the sun (it is likewise regarded as a male creature), the worst enemy of the moon, because otherwise it would hinder the soul's wandering. Loudly sustained, shrill, joyous cries formed the conclusion and made it manifest that the soul of the deceased had found entry into the moon. Then all the warriors, sobbing loudly, formed a circle around the burned-down funeral pyre, while the brother and other relatives gathered up the charred remains of the bones from the ashes. After these had been pounded in gourd vessels by means of small stone mortars, the bone ashes were emptied into two bowls made out of the jamaru fruit, which the brother of the deceased wrapped with palm leaves and a liana binding. Thereupon he handed them to the chief, who lifted up each one in the direction of the moon and, singing, blessed it, while the men standing about uttered shrill cries. With this the end of the ceremony was reached, and the exhausted warriors could again return to their maloka in order to recover in their hammocks from the strenuous night. The brother of the deceased tied the two jamaru bowls containing the bone ashes to the rafters of the roof behind his hearth, in order to keep them for the big annual festival in memory of the dead, at which the bone ashes of their dead, mixed with banana soup, are drunk by the men (see pp.231 ff.). From now on there was no more wailing and weeping in the maloka ; daily life had resumed its normal course.

After the death of women and of children too, as soon as they have completed the third year of life, the death ceremonies are conducted in exactly the same way. For a deceased chief, on the other hand, there is dancing around the funeral pyre for three nights, for, of course, his entrance into the moon must be particularly solemn.

The ceremony for an old person is entirely different. After death has set in, his head is chopped off and is hung, likewise in a little wooden rack, in the crown of a tree, again 15 or 20 minutes away from the maloka . The body, however, is buried in the ground in the jungle without ceremony, and, to be sure, in a squatting position, bound tightly with lianas. This is supposed to prevent its possible return, for it would have dire consequences for the tribe. The head, however, is burned on a small pyre, under the same circumstances as described above, so that the soul may reach the moon in the ascending smoke; the remaining bone ashes are also kept.

The reason for the different obsequies for younger and older persons is the following: At the big annual ceremony in memory of the dead, which is held jointly with the Surára (see pp. 222 ff.), all the men drink the bone ashes of their deceased relatives, mixed with banana soup, because they believe that in this way the vigor and spirit of the dead remain within the tribes. In the case of old people, however, it is assumed that their bodies are already too leached out for their ashes to be able to transmit strength any more. Only the bone ashes of the head are still regarded as valuable.

If members of the tribe are very old or so seriously ill that, in spite of all efforts to cure them, they are no longer able to take part in the joint migrations, they are killed. For this purpose there takes place beforehand a gathering of the chief and older, more experienced men, at which they choose a participant who has to perform the killing. He uses a stick for this and, while the person in question is asleep, beats him hard on the head several times, until he has breathed his last. These tribal members destined for death are thus dispatched into the other world in an altogether humane manner, and even the killing itself is dictated by humane impulses. Since these old and sick persons can, of course, no longer take part in the customary seminomadic way of life, they would be obliged to remain helplessly behind when the tribe sets out on a new migration. This is to be prevented, however, and at the same time it is desired that the way to the moon, the paradise of the dead, be opened for them. After their death, they are cremated in the same way as all other deceased persons, that is to say, in the case of old people only the head is burned, and their ashes, too, are preserved and drunk at the festival in memory of the dead.

Greater than the fear of death among all Surára and Pakidái is the thought that they might one day die without being cremated, for example, during military actions, for then the entrance into the moon is barred for their soul (see p. 198).

Persons who commit incest are excluded from cremation after their demise, and they are not mourned, for incest is regarded as the greatest crime. Poré (see p. 197) does not want their souls on the moon, and partaking of their bone ashes would exert unfavorable influences on the male members of the tribe. They are therefore tied up in a squatting position and buried in a hole in the ground.

If children die before the completion of the third year of life, they are thrown into the river without any ceremony, since they belong to the flesh and blood of the mother and do not yet have their own soul (see p. 138).

For the types of burial of the Surára and Pakidái, which are undoubtedly very old and original, there are no parallels thus far in South America . This is true of the combined tree- and fire-burial as well as of the earth burial of old people. A deceased member of the tribe, however, is only hung in a treetop for two or three weeks, so that his flesh will decay, before the bones are subsequently cremated.

The latter custom, albeit in the form of combined earth- and fire-burial, is, moreover, already mentioned in old sources. “Far inland,” writes Barrere with regard to Guiana, “there are nations who assemble in order to dig out skeletons, when they think that the corpse is almost decayed, and after they have calcined these, they drink the ashes, which they soak in roucou, and they believe that they have thereby given their dead a more decent burial than if they left them to worms and putrefaction” . Similar reports are given by Froger about French Guiana and by de la Neuville and Biet about some of the mainland Karaiben /Carib/ . The Surára and Pakidái, on the other hand, are of the opinion that the soul existing in the bones is able to travel up to the moon only if the flesh has decayed beforehand, and there is now nothing to prevent the soul's withdrawal.

The custom of hanging the corpse in the open until it decays is also documented as early as the seventeenth century, but not in connection with another form of burial. There are statements about this by Coreal concerning the Chevelus (Amaguaxe or Encabellados--members of the Tukano /Tucano/ linguistic family) who lived on both sides of the Putumayo: “They do not bury their dead at all, but hang them in the open until the flesh decays: after that they keep the bones as Relics” /translated from the French/ .",1,0,1,0,1,0
Ritual151,The Festival in Memory of the Dead (patapáanomão),"Religious Festivals

Every year, toward the end of the dry season, March-April, the Surára and Pakidái jointly celebrate the festival in memory of the dead -- patapáanomão -- . It always takes place in the large, open Surára maloka Jaracá (see pp. 25 ff.). Occasionally a few families of friendly tribes (Xiriána, Puseheweterí, Aramamesterí, etc.) also take part. The patapáanomão festival, which I witnessed in all its phases, was held during the period from the fourth to the sixth of April, 1956. But even before that there were great preparations for this purpose. The men set out on a joint hunting expedition in order to kill as many tapirs as possible, the meat of which was then roasted on roasting racks over an even fire, not too hot, until it was black and bone-hard, so that it could be kept for a few days. This roasting belongs to the men's sphere of duties, as does the harvesting of pupunha fruits. The latter are then made into a drink by the women. Moreover, they fetched from the plantings large quantities of bananas which were put in the sun so that they could ripen, and, finally, it should be mentioned that among all the families several stacks of manioc flatcakes were piled up little by little.

On the evening of April fourth, toward 9:00, the actual festival began. Five men and five boys, who wore cotton belts over their hip cords, danced, after the former had first blown snuff-powder into each other's noses, one behind the other (two steps forward and one back, during which the more marked lifting of the knees with a slight turning outward of the legs is to be noted), on a circular path in the open circle of the maloka , and, to be sure, counterclockwise . The first two men each held two arrows in the right hand, and the rest, as well as all the boys, had their hands crossed behind their heads. Occasionally one man would sing in a beautiful, full bass voice, and the others would then join in chorus. The songs were very melodious and furnished the rhythm for the dance steps . Toward 10:00 more men, in part with arrows, in part without, and boys (all without arrows) joined the dancers, and at 11:30 all the men and boys, with the exception of the Surára chief, were gathered in the center of the maloka courtyard, where, from a large clay plate filled with snuff-powder that had been placed here along with several snuff tubes, they blew huge quantities into each other's noses.  Then they sat down in a circle and started singing a song in chorus. Soon afterwards five warriors, holding arrows in both hands, arose and danced around the singers. Now and then they made huge leaps and shouted in a high, shrill voice. All this was enacted on a cool, cloudy, full-moon night, but the numerous hearths added some light. All the women and girls, as well as my servant Mateus and I, lay in the hammocks and watched the unique spectacle. Toward 1:00 in the morning the male participants in the festival arose and now danced, again one behind the other, around the outer circle of the maloka courtyard. They were arranged in such a way that a man with two arrows was always followed by one who held his hands crossed behind his head.

Suddenly Chief Hewemão, who was sleeping in his hammock next to me, was tapped lightly by a warrior with an arrow. He got up at once, removed shirt and trousers (he had been given the two articles of clothing by me as gifts), took a bow without a bowstring in his hand, had snuff-powder blown into his nose, and mixed with the dancers, who, however, immediately after his entrance formed the following new formation: Ten men arranged themselves in rhombus form at the head of the dance procession, one at the very front, two behind to one side, and two more behind and to one side of these; two stood directly opposite the latter, then followed two who stood somewhat inward and finally one who was in the middle behind these (Fig. 29). The first five warriors, who had blackened themselves with soot, symbolized the nonexí (evil spirits or spirits of sickness, see p. 211) and were obliged to dance backwards. The five dancers following them embodied hekurá (gigantic animal and plant spirits who /Fig. 29 appears here/ Pakidái; see pp. 199, 214 ff.). Between these two groups of five, the participants of which each held two arrows in their hands, a sham battle was being carried out during the dance (see also pp. 214 ff.). Each of the men of the first group danced two steps back and one forward, and those of the second, two steps forward and one back. In between, wild leaps and turns were executed, the men threatened each other with the arrows and screamed in the highest key. The “ nonexí ” were constantly in retreat and defended themselves with all their might against the advancing “ hekurá .” Behind these ten “fighting” dancers there followed six men in a row, each with an arrow in his hand, the advance guard of the chief. At a slight distance they were joined by the Surára chief Hewemão, flanked on either side by six men forming a double row. These men were also prominent personalities; thus, among them there were the two younger brothers of the chief, the war chief of the Surára, the chief and war chief of the Pakidái, as well as especially excellent older warriors of both tribes. Following them, as a rear guard, in a double-row formation, came the rest of the men, young men, and boys. All who took part in the procession moved in the customary dance steps, two forward and one back, during which they sang in chorus. Now and then Chief Hewemão would utter a hissing sound, whereupon all the participants grouped themselves in the center of the plaza around the large clay plate with snuff-powder. Here the chief, in a singing voice, prayed to the hekurá and asked them to intercede with Poré/Perimbó , so that the festival would be vouchsafed a happy and successful course. Then the men blew new snuff-powder into each other's noses, whereupon the dance would continue in the manner described above. This dancing and singing lasted, except for the brief interruptions at the clay plate, until 6:00 in the morning.

Immediately after that the Surára chief squatted down at his hearth, and beside him squatted a medicine-man helper. On the opposite side of the large maloka the Pakidái chief and a helper had assumed the same position. Hewemão, the firstnamed chief, began to speak loudly and distinctly to the hekurá (gigantic animal and plant spirits). While doing so, he kept stroking his hair from front to back and then slapping his seat. The helper squatting beside him repeated each of his words and copied all his movements. (This was to express symbolically that the hekurá , the intermediaries between human beings and the united Supreme Being, Poré/Perimbó , actually pass on all questions, requests, and wishes). After Hewemão, the Pakidái chief spoke to the hekurá , and his helper likewise repeated each word and imitated the gestures (stroking the hair and slapping the seat). This exorcism, which the two chiefs carried out alternately, lasted an hour.

After that the two exhausted chiefs and the rest of the men, young men, and boys lay down for a well-earned rest. Meanwhile the women had been going about their accustomed activity. They fetched water, prepared food, took care of the children; some of them also plaited a basket in the meantime, or they strung glass beads on a string. Some of the men who had meanwhile awakened continued to lie idly in their hammocks, some also played with the children, while others sat together in groups and talked.

Toward 2:00 the festival was resumed when 20 men, young men, and boys, each of whom held an arrow in his hand, rushed into the maloka courtyard with loud shouts. They were magnificently painted 510 and on the upper arms and in part in the ear lobes were adorned with colorful feather ornaments (see pp. 93/95). Moreover, they had all glued into their hair the white down feathers of the gavião-real ( Thrasaetus harpyia L.), the dreaded carrier of sickness (see p. 211) (Ill. 43). They made mighty leaps, then bent their knees, turned around several times in between, threw their arrows into the air and caught them again. After that they fell into a dance in step, during which they sang. But this dance was constantly interrupted by wild charges and rousing shouts, which were supposed to drive the nonexí out of the maloka and show them how dangerous it was to come here at all. The others present were enthusiastically watching this performance from their hearths. For the occasion of the festival all the men, women, and children had likewise painted themselves and in part donned the cotton belts; moreover, the men wore their upper-arm ornaments of feathers (Ills. 9-11).

After this two-hour dance performance a particularly solemn ceremony took place, the blessing of the preserved bone ashes of deceased tribesmen. For this purpose two leading personalities of each of the two tribes sat down in a square formation before the chief's hut. The Surára chief Hewemão was squatting in such a way that he faced the maloka courtyard. To the right and left of him, somewhat to the side and forward, squatted the Pakidái chief, Karenauö, and Hewemão's brother, Kurikayawö, respectively, and opposite Hewemão, Poréhiwö, the war chief of the Pakidái, had his place. In front of the latter were arranged ten small jamaru vessels ( jamaru = Cucurbita idolatrica Lacerda) filled with bone ashes. Behind them stood one empty gourd bowl and one filled with urucú. The Pakidái chief, Karenauö, on the other hand, had two large empty jamaru vessels standing in front of him.

Poréhiwö now poured bone ashes from one after another of the small jamaru vessels into the empty gourd bowls, added a little urucú, mixed the two with his hands, and gave the bowl to Karenauö, who each time poured the contents into one of the larger jamaru vessels. While the two Pakidái were silently performing their work, Hewemão was praying in a half-singing voice to the hekurá and constantly passed his hands from his head to his feet. His brother Kurikayawö repeated each of his words and imitated the gestures . Around the four men, who were now officiating as priests, crouched red-painted warriors whose head hair was completely covered with the down feathers of the gavião-real . Whenever the Pakidái chief poured a new mixture of bone ashes and urucú into a larger jamaru vessel, he always pulled a few feathers from the heads of the warriors and threw them in . The closest relatives of the late deceased sat behind the warriors and sobbed heart-rendingly, especially the women. Their tears flowed uninterruptedly, and at the same time they prayed in a low, singing cadence. When the bone ashes of another jamaru vessel were mixed with urucú by Poréhiwö, their sobbing and their prayers changed to high, shrill tones. This made no impression upon the medicine men, however, who imperturbably went on with their activity. The mourners were surrounded by a circle of standing warriors painted red and adorned with upper-arm feathers, who held bows and arrows in their hands and faced outward. It was their task to shield the ceremony against harmful outside influences. Behind them stood numerous male spectators, who followed the proceedings with interest, to be sure, but without inner participation, for at times they laughed and joked.

When the mixing of bone ashes, which lasted about two hours, was finished, Poréhiwö returned the half-empty little jamaru vessels to the relatives, who, amid lamentations, took them for further safekeeping. Then a solemn procession began, in which, however, the Surára chief did not take part. Karenauö, the Pakidái chief, strode ahead, followed by Poréhiwö and Kurikayawö, each of whom held in his hand one of the large jamaru vessels filled with bone ashes, a little urucú, and a few down-feathers of the gavião-real ; all three were singing prayers. Behind them, weeping and lamenting, walked the closest relatives, who carried the small jamaru vessels. The warriors participating in the ceremony formed the end of the train. This procession, which walked around the maloka courtyard several times, came to an end, after half an hour in front of the chief's hut, with a prayer sung in unison.

Meanwhile night had descended and most of the members of the two tribes were lying in their hammocks, sitting around the fire, or calling on each other, singly or in family groups, in order to chat. Loud, happy laughter often resounded. Opposite the hut of the Surára chief, however, six warriors who wore the feathers of the gavião-real in their hair had kindled three blazing fires, upon which, in several black, round-bottomed clay vessels (see p. 115) they cooked banana soup until midnight. During this time a medicine-man helper who carried a bow and arrow in his hand ran around the outer circle of the maloka courtyard, singing loudly, and requested the assistance of the hekurá for the success of the soup. After that, general quiet set in; only two men made their rounds in front of the maloka , as they did every night, in order to warn the inhabitants, if necessary, of a hostile attack .

On the next day, April 6, 1956, the festival reached its climax. Toward 9:00 the Surára chief, his brother Kurikayawö, and the chief and war chief of the Pakidái sat down around the pots of banana soup, in front of which also stood the two jamaru vessels with the bone ashes of the deceased, and all the other male members of the tribe sat around them. The Surára chief started to pray loudly, whereupon a rather long choral song was struck up. Then he poured the bone ashes into all the soup pots, mixed them thoroughly with his hands, and scooped out a calabash full for himself, which he emptied hastily and to the last drop. Thereupon the Pakidái chief, the brother of Hewemão, and the war chiefs of both tribes drank, followed by all the older and younger men, including the larger boys, who drank last . As a result of this ceremonial drinking of the bone ashes, it is believed, the strength and spirit of the deceased will remain within the tribe and contribute to its vigor.

Following this drink, a prayer of thanksgiving was sung. Then the men, youths, and boys together ate large quantities of the roasted tapir meat, as well as manioc flat-cakes, and after that the women handed them calabashes full of the refreshing drink made of pupunha fruits.

Invigorated and fortified with the powers of the deceased, the men were now able to proceed with the most strenuous part of the festival. But before this began, half of them blackened their faces and bodies with soot, which they scraped off of their cooking pots. Meanwhile others had again set in the center of the maloka circle the large clay plate upon which they poured the brownish snuff-powder-- epená --, out of bamboo containers, and in front of the plate they laid a large number of snuff-tubes. After these preparations, the chiefs, all the men, youths, and boys, light and black-colored participants, assembled outside the maloka . At a hissing sound from Hewemão they then stormed into the courtyard, screaming loudly, ran once around the periphery, and then grouped themselves around the clay plate. The snuff-tubes were filled with powder, and the men by twos blew it with all their might into each other's noses (Ill. 44). On the occasion of this festival they take even more snuff than before other magic performances, curing the sick, and prayers. The effect was extraordinary. After only a few moments all the men were in a wild state of ecstasy (Ills. 45 and 46). At first they danced and leaped, gesticulating and screaming, in wild disorder around the clay plate, and after that they stormed around the courtyard several times in the same manner. Then groups of five, ten, or more men put their arms around each other's necks and performed stamping circledances in this formation (Ill. 47), during which each man tried to pull another one tightly to him; now and then they also danced with the knees bent. After half an hour, this ecstatic dancing, during which the participants were bathed in sweat, was replaced by an extremely strange type of sport-- petapóanhamú . In the entire outer circle of the maloka courtyard there were seated everywhere two men opposite each other, chest to chest, with legs spread apart; in each case one had his on top of the thighs of the other one. The partners were always a Surára and a Pakidái; moreover, in each case one of them was blackened. They wound their arms around each other at the neck and, with vigorous arm movements, pulled each other back and forth with all their might (Ill. 48). Each tried to pull the head of his opponent quite close to him. Sometimes their arms would drop down on the back of the other one, and they would then pull at each other for a while in this position. During the struggle they constantly called out wrathful words at each other. Often the wives stood beside their husbands and spurred them on. But there were no victors and no losers in these combats. If the strength of a combatant flagged, another tribesman immediately came and continued the struggle with the opponent in his place. The wife then massaged the head of the exhausted one, so that he would quickly be ready to resume. The chiefs and war chiefs in particular distinguished themselves in this type of sport. They also fought the longest, some of them with five, six, and more opponents; they had positively unbelievable strength and endurance.

These combats, in which one man always symbolically represented the good spirit, that is, a hekurá , and the other, who had smeared himself with soot, the evil spirit, a nonexí (see pp. 213 ff., 225 ff.), lasted almost two hours. After that the men were completely exhausted and refreshed themselves with a new, joint meal of tapir meat and manioc flatcakes. Afterwards, however, many of the participants suffered from severe headaches brought on by the snuff-powder in connection with the inhuman physical exertion, so that many wives were obliged to massage their husbands' heads.

In the evening there was another half-hour procession in the, maloka courtyard, when all the little jamaru vessels in which remains of bone ashes were stored were carried along. This retention of a certain amount of ashes is very important, so that the next festival in memory of the dead can be held, even though no member of the tribe 108 dies up to that time. It could not take place without any bone ashes of deceased Surára or Pakidái.

If one compares this annual festival with that of the Waiká, which was described by Zerries in great detail , one finds extensive analogies in the most important phases. Zerries believes that among the Waiká it was originally a harvest festival to which other rites of various kinds were added . For the Surára and Pakidái, on the other hand, it can definitely be said that here there are no features reminiscent of a harvest festival. It is decidedly a festival in memory of the dead, which characterized by the ceremonial drinking of the bone ashes of deceased members of the tribe. At the same time, defensive magic against the nonexí is connected with it, for they, of course, are the ones who transmit sickness and thereby frequently cause death. As in all the magic cures for healing the sick, where the symbolic struggles between the “ hekurá ” and one or more “ nonexí ” are always enacted (see pp. 212 ff.), this factor is naturally also in evidence in all parts of the festival, in the dances, in the mixing of bone ashes, when the medicine man pulls down-feathers of the gavião-real out of the hair of the warriors and adds these, and in the duels performed in a sitting position. The latter are also documented for the Waiká in the same way, but Zerries writes that neither for him nor for the American missionaries was it possible to find out anything definite about the meaning of this ceremony . Presumably, however, it is the same symbolic struggle between a good and an evil spirit as among the Surára and Pakidái. As yet nothing has been reported about this from other Indian tribes. My informants, however, told me that the Xiriána, Puseheweterí, and Aramamesterí engage in these combats on the occasion of their festivals in memory of the dead. Hence it seems to be a very special characteristic of the Yanonámi, which in former times may have been even more widespread. Herr Dr. Gerdt Kutscher, in connection with a lecture I gave in Berlin, called my attention to the fact that the position taken by the two men during this is reminiscent of the painting on a clay bowl from the Rio Ulúa, Honduras According to Zerries, Barker, and Dupouy, there is also a similar combat among the Waiká, in which the partners alternately beat each other on the chest with clenched fists. I did not observe this among the Surára and Pakidái. Similarly unknown there is the custom, also reported by Zerries, that the men, when they run about in the snuff-powder intoxication, hit each other on the back with the palm of the hand . The author named regards this as a fertility rite. There seems to be involved here, however, outside influences of agricultural tribes, which is indicated also by the ceremonial gathering of pupunha fruits .

It is further noteworthy that among the Waiká women and girls actively participate in the festival in that they take part in some dances and even drink some of the banana soup mixed with bone ashes . In contrast to this, the female members of the tribe act only as spectators among the Surára and Pakidái.

The endocannibalism should be regarded as a very significant similar trait. It is documented for the Waiká by Cruxent and Zerries in several articles . Moreover, the latter author, on the basis of contributions to the first five volumes of the Handbook of South American Indians , drew up a distribution may for the occurrence of endocannibalism, which was supplemented by numerous examples . According to this, endocannibalism occurs in South American primarily in the western parts of the continent and among the marginal and submarginal tribes of the Tropical zone. This custom is particularly frequent among the Pano and Tukano/Tucano/. In most cases, besides the pulverized bones, which are mixed with chicha (for example, Pano and Tukano), water (for example, Tapuya), or a mash of Pará chestnuts (Moré Indians), the flesh is also eaten. The practice of the Surára, Pakidái, and Waiká, on the other hand, who consume only the cremated, pulverized bones, is very rarely found. The corresponding custom of the Sáliba, Guayupe, and Saé in Colombia is the most similar one. But in eastern Guiana, too, endocannibalism is widespread, for example, among the Karaiben /Carib/ Parukotó and among the Arapium, a Tupi tribe in the vicinity of Santarem . Moreover, it is reported of the Kalina, Palikur, and Arawak that they consume cremated bones of the dead . Of the latter Ralegh also writes that they pound the bones to powder and consume them mixed with a beverage , and the same has been attested to for the Mauhé .

According to Whiffen, there is no endocannibalism at all in South America, for, according to his view, only vengeance against hostile tribes can be regarded as a motive for anthropophagy. “From all this,” he continues, “it follows that intratribal cannibalism would be a criminal outrage by the tribe on itself, and therefore it could never occur that a member of the tribe was eaten, .... This disposes of any such thing as the eating of dead relatives as a sign of respect. These and similar statements are due to missapprehension /sic/ of facts by the writer, or a too hasty judgement on the part of the explorer” /cited in English/ . In conjunction with these devious statements by Whiffen with their completely unjustified criticism, I should like to cite a contribution concerning endocannibalism drawn up by Herbert Baldus and Emilio Willems :  /The long passage in Portuguese which follows on pp. 109-110 in the original source is omitted in the translation; see the foreign text/

Most recently there appeared the commendable study by Boglár, “Ein endokannibalischer Ritus in Südamerika /An Endocannibalistic Rite in South America/,” in which the author presents the material of several competent sources . I cannot, however, agree with his interpretations in connection with them. The consumption of the bone powder of the deceased is by no means always to be associated with agricultural tribes, for, as my informants among the Surára and Pakidái explained to me, their forebears, who were pure hunters and gatherers, already practiced this custom. Also the author's view that the showing of respect, the magical transmission of good qualities, etc., can be regarded merely as secondary motives of the endocannibalistic rite , do not apply to the Surára and Pakidái; here they are decidedly primary. Among them the future life of the dead is assured by cremation, for with the ascending smoke the soul of the dead reaches the moon (see p. 151).

It should further be mentioned that endocannibalism is documented also for Central America, Mexico, and in one case in North America, but Beals regards it as a typical element of the South American Indians .

Between the patapáanomão festivals the Surára and Pakidái have only a few other festivities in the course of the year. These are but small celebrations, which, for example, take place after the two-months' training of two young men as medicine-man helpers, after a successful war-expedition, upon moving into a newly erected maloka , and in connection with the second menstruation of a girl. The latter has more of an intimate character, for only families of relatives and friends take part in it.",1,0,1,0,1,0
Ritual152,Magical Cure,"b) Magic cure ( rekurá ) for Xunamí: c) Magic cure ( rekurá ) for Xanimá:

Xunamí, the young, pretty wife of Kurikayawö, fell ill quite suddenly. She had a high fever, lay apathetically in her hammock, and complained of severe chest pains. Her husband, who, with touching devotion, remained with her throughout the first day, that is, he sat beside her or lay in his hammock, led her several times to the nearby small river, in which she always remained for some time and drank copious amounts. She was not permitted to eat anything, but she had no desire to do so. During the night, the fever seemed to climb, for she was quite delirious and unable to sleep soundly. The next day she felt even worse. Three times in the forenoon and as often in the afternoon her husband took her to the river, but there was no improvement after the baths and the drinking. At noon on the third day the husband, together with two other men, began the first special cure. First of all, Kurikayawö and the second participant painted serpentine lines on their faces and bodies with urucú, while the third one rubbed himself all over with soot. Then they all three blew snuff-powder into each other's noses and in a few minutes they were in a state of ecstasy in which they leaped wildly about the sick woman lying in her hammock, shouted loudly, and gesticulated. Then, however, the cure followed very definite directions. The man painted completely black symbolically represented the spirit of sickness -- nonexí -- whom a hostile medicine man had conjured into the body of the sick woman, and the other two men, who now identified themselves with the hekurá (see p. 200), staged a sham battle against him. At first they were armed with large sticks and beat “ nonexí ” in order to kill him. But he defended himself with all his might. Then he hurled arrows at him, which, however, he threw back. After that the spirit of sickness stuck a carrying basket on his head, and this suddenly fell off. At once, the other two men beat quite hard upon the basket with their sticks, in order to give the sickness the finishing blow. All the movements were executed in a dance rhythm, two steps forward and one back, during which the “ hekurá ” uninterruptedly sang the words ho-he-hi-ha-ík , ho-he-hi-ha-ík , while “ nonexí ” uttered shrill sounds in between. At first the “battle” was enacted at some distance from the sick woman, but during the “argument” they drew nearer to her. “ Nonexí ” now danced alone at the head end of Xunamí, and the two “ hekurá ” stroked the body of the sick woman and sucked at it. Then they vomited, and one of them suddenly took a stone out of his mouth, and the other, a piece of wood. With shrill cries they threw these objects away, while “ nonexí, ” who was still at the head end of the patient, crouched down and started to whimper loudly. With the stone and the piece of wood the sickness was to be hurled back to the Waiká. Then the sham battle between “ nonexí ” and the “ hekurá ” began anew, frequently interrupted by the sucking and stroking of the body of the sick woman, who suffered everything indifferently. Meanwhile the men kept blowing snuff-powder into each other's noses. For four hours the treatment went on, but there was no improvement to be seen in Xunamí; rather, she grew worse. The sick woman was then set on the ground in front of her hammock, and two other men, this time only personified hekurá , continued the treatment in snuff-powder intoxication, in that they danced around the woman, sang, and screamed loudly. In between, they stroked Xunamí's body and sucked out little stones, which they spat upon, licked, and then rubbed against their own bodies before they hurled them away with shrill cries. Now and then they also struck out with hands and feet and threatened an invisible foe. Occasionally they spat and stepped on the sputum with gestures of repugnance. Then the patient was again placed in her hammock and doused with cold water.

As a result of the high fever and long fasting, Xunamí was already very weak. But during the coming night a very great rekurá (magic cure; see also p. 211) was to be performed, and, to be sure, by Chief Hewemão and eight helpers. (The chief intervenes only if the day-cures of individual men have been unsuccessful.) Immediately after darkness set in, the men assembled, eight of whom, including the chief, had painted their faces and bodies with red serpentine lines, while the ninth was blackened with soot. A little to one side of the sick woman they formed a circle around the large clay plate standing in the center, upon which there was snuff-powder. They blew considerable amounts of this into each other's noses and then danced around in a circle, singing loudly and shouting. This, as the chief later explained to me, was to establish contact with the hekurá . These preparations lasted about half an hour. Then, dancing and singing, they drew nearer to the sick woman. This time she stood in front of her hammock, held by her husband, who had slipped his arms under hers and folded them over her chest, for she was no longer able to stand alone. Shouting loudly, the men danced around her several times and then leaped into the inner circle of the large, open maloka , where, in great rage, they hurled away invisible objects. Then they spat upon them and trampled furiously on these imaginary objects, at the same time uttering loud threats against the Waiká. After that they danced and leaped in apparent disorder back and forth between the sick woman, whose body they stroked a few times at each encounter, and the inner court of the maloka , during which they now and then shouted loudly, executed wild leaps, and at the same time turned in a circle. Whenever they came outside the dwelling part, they again tossed away invisible objects. This dancing, leaping, and shouting, the motions of 99 casting away, the bending of the knees, the pointing forward and upward with the hands seemed to be utter confusion, and the noise that went with it was indescribable. After that the chief and his brother danced alone for about 40 minutes around the sick woman, who meanwhile was being held by another man. They blew in her direction and sucked at her body, at the same time massaging it. By turns they leaped a few meters backward and threw away imaginary objects. -- Meanwhile the eight medicine-man helpers had moved away a bit from the hearth. The man blackened with soot lay on the ground, symbolically portraying the evil  nonexí , while the other seven, who, exactly like the chief and his brother, identified themselves with the hekurá , danced and leaped around him. They kicked at him with their feet, uttered invectives, threatened him with their fists, and beat him. Suddenly, “ nonexí ” tried to flee, but the other men quickly caught up with him and threw the “evil spirit of sickness” to the ground again. They tapped his body, sucked at it, and spat over him. In fact, they even beat him symbolically with sticks. Then a stone weighing two kilograms was placed on the abdomen of “ nonexí, ” was picked up again after a short time, and was hurled away. At that the fiendish noise suddenly ceased. Chief Hewemão squatted before the sick woman, completely absorbed within himself. Behind him crouched his brother Kurikayawö, who stroked his body and head and lightly tapped his back. Complete silence prevailed; only the moaning of the chief and of the sick woman was to be heard, frequently interrupted by the loud sighs of the former. The other seven “ hekurá ” meanwhile squatted silently around the prostrate “ nonexí .” The sick woman now sat between the legs of the man who had hitherto supported her. After the chief had concentrated, which lasted about 30 minutes, all the participants in the rekurá formed a circle around Xunamí. The chief crouched directly opposite her, face to face with her, and commenced to sing loudly in a wonderful baritone voice, while the other eight men, with the exception of the “ nonexí ,” joined in chorus. It was a part song and so melodious that it sounded to me like an organ. Now and then the medicine-man helpers stood up and walked, singing, around the patient, while the chief stroked her body from head to foot, massaged her, tapped her, and sucked at her. Each time he would spit out imaginary objects, whereupon the other men always broke out in loud cries of “ oh ” and “ ah. ” This choral singing and the manipulations accompanying it lasted for about three hours. Then Hewemão sucked especially vigorously on Xunamí's body, while his hands kept stroking her downwards. All at once there was a stone weighing about one kilogram in his right hand, and three small stones, two pieces of wood, and two fingernails in his left. He had sucked all these objects out of her body and now hurled them away with gestures of disgust, amid the loud shouts of “ oh ” and “ ah ” by his helpers. During this sucking and stroking, the chorus of all the “ hekurá ” standing in a circle swelled to tremendous power and subsided only after Hewemão slowly withdrew, for his work was ended for the time being. He was bathed in sweat and, completely exhausted, lay down in his hammock, where his two wives provided him with a nourishing meal consisting of roasted tapir meat, manioc flat-cakes, and a bacaba drink.

The sick woman was not released, however, even after this five-hour cure. From 11:00 to 1:00 at night the husband and the medicine-man helpers continued it in the manner described above. The main thing was the choral singing and the dancing in step, with occasional sitting, stroking the sick woman, sucking, threatening hand movements toward an invisible opponent, spitting, etc. added. At 1:00 two more men dropped out, including the husband. The latter now lifted his wife up and laid her in her hammock, then he crouched beside her and tenderly supported her head. For about another two hours the medicine-man helpers went on singing and “curing” and after that one alone until around 5:00. Only then could the sick woman surrender herself for a short time to a well-earned rest . Many other members of the tribe watched this magic performance, above all women, who wept softly during it. They crouched in a semicircle at a somewhat greater distance and watched the proceedings with rapt attention, but only as long as the chief was acting. When he finished his work, the spectators gradually disappeared.

Unfortunately, all efforts remained unsuccessful in this case, and Hewemão confessed to me the next day, when the sick woman was much worse, that this time the power of the Waiká medicine men was extraordinarily great. I then proposed to him that I should give Xunamí penicillin injections. After lengthy consultations with the husband and other male members of the tribe he consented, though with misgivings, and luck was with the patient as well as with me. From this moment on the name penicilina (Portuguese spelling) became a magic word, for it had helped to cast away the sickness. Hewemão even asked me to bring him a great deal of it on my next visit.

Xanimá, the approximately 47-year-old mother of Anyarawö (see p. 126), had been ill for five days with chicken pox and had had persistently high fever. At first she, too, was given the water cures, that is, she constantly had to take baths in the river and drink a great deal of water; as her weakness increased, she remained lying in her hammock and was doused with cold water. After that there were sham battles between two “ hekurá ” and the bad, black-colored spirit of sickness, “ nonexí .”

When there was no improvement, Chief Hewemão and eight helpers again arranged a large, nocturnal rekurá , but this time a somewhat different one, because, of course, a different sickness was involved . At first the men, eight with red serpentine lines painted on their faces and bodies and one colored black, in the light of the hearth, again formed a circle around the large clay plate standing in the middle, on which snuff-powder had been poured. They filled their snuff tubes with generous amounts of it and blew it into each other's noses, whereupon, after a few minutes, the state of ecstasy set in. The men hopped around their own axis several times, and, after a hissing sound on the part of the chief and with prolonged shrill cries in the most diverse tones, they rushed toward the sick woman. They were like a wild horde, for the participants screamed at the top of their voices, bent their knees, leaped into the air, and shook their fists at an invisible foe. After a renewed hissing sound by Hewemão, they formed a circle around the sick woman lying in her hammock, and each man placed both hands on the shoulders of the one standing in front of him. With swaying dance steps, two forward and one back, during which they sang ho-he-hi-ha-ík , ho-he-hi-ha-ík , they walked around the patient for some time. Then Hewemão hissed for the third time, whereupon the song ceased. Then the chief struck up a melodious song which his helpers underscored with humming. Meanwhile, with swaying step, they continued to move around the sick woman, their hands always on the shoulders of the man in front as before. After 15 minutes Hewemão hissed again, and then they laid their hands crossed upon the shoulders of the one walking ahead. At the same time all the men joined in the song of the chief, and again they sang in parts. This choral singing, together with the dancing in step, lasted another 20 minutes. Then the chief and his brother Kurikayawö placed themselves opposite each other at the head end of the patient and struck up an alternate song. At the foot end squatted two helpers who also faced each other and hummed softly. A short distance behind the head end two more helpers danced back and forth with faces turned toward each other; they were also humming, and occasionally they uttered bird-like sounds; they frequently ran their fingers through their hair and then always passed them downward over their seats. Meanwhile the other three men, two painted red, the one black-colored, that is to say, two “ hekurá ” and “ nonexí ,” were carrying on a sham battle beyond the foot end of Xanimá, in a manner similar to that already descríbed on page 216. In the meantime the daughter-in-law of the sick woman had raised her up and had seated herself behind her in the hammock, at the same time supporting the old woman with both arms. Then when the sham combat was ended, and the bad “ nonexí ” lay on the ground and the two “ hekurá ” crouched beside him as “victors,” a part song by all the participants began once more. At the same time the chief stroked the head and then the body of the sick woman. Then he started to suck at her, first at her head, then on the chest, on the stomach, and on the thighs. Then he uttered shrill cries and vomited. At this moment the singing ceased and all the helpers uttered loud cries of “ ah ” and “ oh .” Thereupon Hewemão hurled invisible objects to one side, which was always accompanied by ah and oh shouts of the other men. Then a chorus was struck up anew. This part of the magic performances lasted more than two hours. After the chief had sucked stones and pieces of wood out of the body of the sick woman and hurled them away amid animated cries of ah and oh by the helpers, however, the volume of the singing increased and was followed by shrill cries which ended in a general humming. -- After that there was complete silence. The men sat down in a circle around Xanimá, and each one leaned his head against his knees, for all were visibly exhausted, especially the chief and his brother. The wives of the latter, however, had seated themselves behind them and stroked their heads and shoulders and gently tapped their backs in order to give the weary ones new strength, for during the curing process they had completely spent themselves. The sick woman, too, could now lie down again. She had her eyes closed and one could see how exhausted she was from sitting up so long. After the noise that had been going on, the stillness had a very strange effect. But after only 15 minutes one of the medicine-man helpers arose; he began dancing in a circle around the sick woman, during which he softly sang. Meanwhile, however, clouds had passed before the moon and a heavy rain set in. Hewemão then decided to break off the session and continue it at dawn. “For with a darkened sky,” he said, “without the co-operation of the moon, it would be impossible to free the woman from her sickness.” He left behind with the moaning Xanimá, shaken with fever chills, two helpers who crouched to the right and left of her head end and hummed softly, in order that, as Hewemão told me, contact with the hekurá would not be broken. Toward 4:30, the rain had stopped in the meantime, the nine men once more gathered around the sick woman and continued the cure for another two hours in the manner described above. By forenoon the fever was gone and the woman was on the way to recovery. She and every other member of the tribe were convinced that Hewemão had hurled the evil spirit of sickness, nonexí , back to the Waiká. Even Hewemão himself firmly believes that in the snuff-powder intoxication and with the help of the hekurá and the moon he is able to ward off sickness and accidents and to cast them out.",1,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual153,Hunting Magic,"Hunting Magic

The evening before a proposed hunting expedition the hunter takes snuff-powder and prays for about 2-3 hours to the hekurá (see pp. 200/201), whereby through them he requests Poré and Perimbó (see p. 197) for a successful outcome. Then, before he sets out the next morning, he paints serpentine lines on his face and body with urucú. If his wife accompanies him, she also applies this design, and the snout and feet of a dog that is taken along are painted with the same color. This is supposed to increase the luck of the hunt and is at the same time bound up with defensive magic against possible dangers threatened by poisonous snakes and jaguars.

If the hunter accompanied by his wife has slain small game or a bird, the wife carries the hunting booty into the community house. If the man was alone, he brings the animal only to the entrance of his dwelling. It is taken inside by his wife or by another man. The same is true for big game, for example, a tapir, from which a few pieces of meat are first taken along; the rest is fetched later by friendly fellow tribesmen. Thus, the hunter may always carry his booty to the entrance of the maloka , but he may never go inside with it. He must also leave the evisceration of the animal to other men. Subsequently he may roast the meat, to be sure, but after it has been prepared, he is forbidden to eat the first morsel, When he has finished his meal, he is obliged to pray anew by way of the hekurá to Poré and Perimbó , for the latter demand that one thank them for the hunting booty. If the hunter observes all these rules, the united Supreme Being and the hekurá will always be well-disposed toward him and will always provide for a successful outcome of the hunt.

Among many other tribes of South America there are the same or similar conceptions of hunting magic. I can here refer to Zerries, who has gathered together the pertinent source material and made a comparative study of it. This shows that urucú is almost always used for the red coloring before the hunt. Métraux, however, mentions that the ancient Mocovi in the Gran Chaco smeared the snouts of their dogs with jaguar blood . From this Zerries draws the justifiable conclusion that urucú is a substitute for blood , which Métraux also documents for the Chiriguano

It should also be pointed out that the hunting rule so strictly observed by the Surára and Pakidái men, which says that a hunter may never carry his game into the maloka himself, can probably be traced back to Karaiben /Carib/ influences. In this connection Zerries speaks of propitiatory rites relating to the killed animal According to his investigations, the northern region of South America emerges as the nuclear area, where they are found primarily among Karaiben tribes of the Venezuelan coast and its hinterland . The author cites Roth and Crévaux as the most important sources, as well as the very old report by Rochefort , which shows that even the Island Karaiben were acquainted with this custom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual154,Rain Magic,"Rain Magic

Although the Surára and Pakidái appreciate rain more than too strong a radiation from the sun , there are occasions when it is not needed, for example, before hunting expeditions or during a tribal migration. In this case all the men, women, and children paint their bodies with a confusion of serpentine lines, in order by this means to command the rain to stop. If this does not help, a tug of war -- toôtotó -- with a thick liana is arranged. This liana personifies the sucuriju ( Eunectes murinus ) -- uaikonyá -- which, as a strong water-animal, has the power to induce Poré to stop shaking the rain tree (see p. 199). At first only two groups of red-painted men engage in the tug of war. But if the rain simply will not abate, red-painted women also take part in it. Their participation is supposed to increase the pressure on the sucuriju , for it is assumed that it is of the female sex and thus particularly well-disposed toward women. Such a tug of war often goes on for several hours. In most cases, besides adults, I also saw children who imitated it with a thin liana.

If it happens to rain while the sun is shining, the Surára and Pakidái believe that a serious fight has broken out between the moon, from which the rain comes, and the sun. Then all the members of the tribe feel obligated to come to the aid of their Supreme Being, the moon. They do this by again forming two mixed groups of men and women -- one symbolically represents the population of the moon and the other that of the sun -- who throw wet earth at each other; this “battle” is called xejejó.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual155,Power Quest for Spirit,"The Power Quest

The quest for supernatural aid is open to everyone, men and women, boys and girls. It is a constantly recurring feature of their lives. Everyone, perhaps without exception, seeks the powers at least once during his lifetime and further experiences seem to be repeatedly sought.

The first occasion is always puberty. I doubt that boys and girls are expected to be uniformly successful in securing aid at this time, because, it was said, at shamanistic performances those who had power might sing their songs. This may imply that the others either never acquired power or had lost it. My informants’ frequent emphasis on the period of mourning for a husband, wife, or child marks this, too, as a peculiarly pregnant period when power may be successfully sought. At least at such a time a man loses his power and must seek again if he wishes to regain it. A man also seeks power at the birth of a first child. But it is not only the crises of life that provide occasion; the quest may be undertaken at any time, and it is the practice of such as gamblers and shamans to renew and enhance their powers by frequent attempts. The quest is called sp[unknown]u’tu.

The experience does not ordinarily include a vision, but is made manifest in a song heard in a dream. In some instances where a vision is had, a dream song follows, but it is clear that the latter is the essential experience. In the following case a man and a woman had identical visions but to the man alone fell the experience leading to power.

The grandfather of a Klamath Falls shaman went to st[unknown]o’km[unknown]ote, the point of Eagle Ridge, in the evening. There is a spot in the lake where bubbles rise. Horses lived in this long ago (!). When this man reached the headland he saw two pinto horses, with long manes, rearing against each other from the water. He was not frightened but took off his clothes and plunged into the water in order to secure power. When he recovered consciousness he found himself again on land. From that time he was lucky; he began to get many pintos, large horses. Because of this experience his grandson, the shaman, also acquired, in his turn, spirit songs of all kinds.

An old woman, gathering wood at this place, also saw two horses in the water. Turning to her husband she said, “There are horses standing over there,” but when they looked again, the horses had disappeared. Such a disappearance (tEko’t[unknown]ka) is a sign that a relative will die; one of her relatives died after this.

Visions evidently follow one of two formulae. Either, as above, the spirit appears standing in the water and then disappears, or it drags the swimmer below the water for the purpose of devouring him, as instanced below.

One word swi’[unknown]is means song and spirit being. A certain dualism is involved here. Spirits are definite beings that dwell in the mountains and in the water. On the other hand all songs are called swi’[unknown]is, including those for amusement and non-shamanistic dancing, which bear no reference to spirits. That is, spirits and songs are certainly recognized as separate entities. Nevertheless, when it is said that a man has a Coyote swi’[unknown]is, for example, it means that he has the appropriate song or songs and that this animal is his supernatural helper. The spirit never manifests itself but in the song; the singer is the vehicle, the voice of the spirit. Song and spirit are one and the same thing.

Power is sought in lonely spots on the mountains, in mountain pools, in eddies in the rivers, in all places where spirits are known to dwell. A boy is sent into the mountains on a vigil of several days, perhaps five, at puberty, that is, when his voice changes. He seeks power that he may acquire property, be a good hunter, become rich, a chief, and be able to do all the things that are difficult. (One does not need power to be a fisherman, for instance.) He must fast and must not touch his hands to his face, but must use a scratcher instead. He must sleep without covering and warm himself only occasionally by a little fire. He runs about constantly throughout the night, piling rocks into high piles (called sEwa’l) and swimming in the mountain pools. He prays, calling loudly to the spirits, and finally gets an answer. At night he may see a spirit with blood flowing from his mouth; then he faints and when he wakes he too will have a hemorrhage (dj[unknown]akgl[unknown]ekg[unknown]e’[unknown]ka). He “nearly dies” before he secures the song.

It is possible that girls also seek power at puberty. Their dance at this time takes place at night; during the day they sleep in the brush or on the near-by hills. Then a song may be dreamed. One informant had it that they spend the night piling rocks like boys, returning at daylight, but I consider it very unlikely that a girl would be allowed to go unattended. Women well along in years, however, follow the regular practice, at least as to bathing in the spirit places.

The same method is pursued by the mourner, gambler, or shaman who seeks power, but swimming in the deep river eddies was more frequently mentioned in this connection. These seekers are almost always men, but older strong-willed women will attempt it. Power may be sought at any time during the year, but they do not dive for it until the first willow buds appear (in the seventh month, March or April). I presume that deep snows and ice in the mountains preclude earlier attempts.

During the day the seeker sweats and fasts, waiting in the brush until nightfall. He then goes to the river and dives to the bottom in search of the spirit. He must not be frightened even if he sees something moving under the water. He prays before diving, “I want to be a shaman. Give me power. Catch me. I need the power.” Sometimes he comes up unconscious, blood streaming from his mouth and nose. He must wait until the flow stops before going home. This night he hears nothing because he has been frightened by the spirit, nor will he eat the following day for fear of falling ill. On the following night or soon after, he hears the song of the spirit as it sings beneath the water. He may dream of hunting deer, acquiring horses, of success in gambling or with women, and of marriage. One informant dreamed of being in an earth-lodge. When he wakes the seeker sings about the subject of his dream. One song dreamed by an old woman is

e’ha e’ha e’ha e’ha e’ha
(repeated four times)
noai’meso spu’[unknown]g[unknown]otg[unknown]ople’ sp[unknown]u’[unknown]g[unknown]otg[unknown]ople’
I am the one pursuing you.

It seems that, like a boy at puberty, this seeker, after swimming, may go to the mountains to fast and pile rocks. He may remain there for some time, but one exceptionally rapid quest was cited. Nancy’s father having lost a child, he went swimming in Crater lake; before evening he had become a shaman.

A power quest under unusual circumstances is that of LEle’ks. This man, the most prominent and successful chief of the last century, was a berdache in his youth. His people wanted him to give up woman’s garb. One day when he lay asleep they placed a woman’s canoe pole and a bow and arrows beside him. Shouting suddenly, they woke him and as he leaped up he seized the bow, thus determining his future life. Running off to Mount Scott he spent the night there. As he was returning he smelled the sweaty odor of running horses. In later life he was lucky in everything; much wealth, especially horses, came to him.

Dreams of the same sort came to men or to old women without being deliberately sought. Should a man have several such visions, he may decide to become a shaman, whereupon he undertakes the customary fire dance of the novice. But if he chooses to ignore them, the power and the opportunity slip away.

Last night I [Pat] dreamed a song: I am nearly a shaman. Yesterday I tried to catch fish but it rained too hard. I then went to town but I could not get what I wanted. So I returned home, ate, and lay down. I dreamed that my horses fell in the mire when I drove near the mountain. I wanted to save them but I could not raise them. I heard a woman’s song behind me.

dje’udj[unknown]is sna[unknown]iw[unknown]as
feathers all over woman
Helen sna’w[unknown]as
[his daughter’s name] woman

The fish did not like me; they did not let me catch any. They made the bad dream. This is the same way as a shaman dreams.

Another dream, though not of this type, may be inserted here.

Last night I (Coley) dreamed I was chased by a big, black man; not a Negro, just hard to distinguish. He had nearly caught me when I woke and heard the chickens squawking.

There is only a slight tendency to the inheritance of the shaman’s art. The case cited above where a shaman received spirit songs because his grandfather had an experience is hardly to the point, since these experiences are so common that every shaman must have had a close relative who obtained power. But my informant’s statement that when a powerful shaman dies his child may become a shaman is borne out by her own case. His spirits and his clairvoyant powers (dode’[unknown]uks, dreaming) are released by his death and must go to someone else. If his relatives keep his pipe or other paraphernalia about, it is certain that his spirits will come to one of them.

Nancy’s father, who died before she was born, was a shaman. When she was quite small and could first understand, she began to dream of Frog, a big woman spirit. Sometimes she would jump up at night and run, afraid of the dream. The spirits persisted in trying to make her accept until she was grown; finally she heard their voices whispering close behind her. She was about twenty and had several children at the time. Her relatives did not want her to become a shaman. Her older sister (i.e., mother’s sister’s daughter) gave her medicine so that the spirits would no longer bother her. Two of Nancy’s children became sick. A shaman, Alee Wilson, diagnosed their case as due to Nancy’s refusal to answer the spirits, to begin the shamanistic performance. Another shaman was called in to relieve her of the spirits. He did it very quickly; he had three or four spirits to lead each of Nancy’s “to their side.” He used the songs of these spirits immediately, for they were now his. These two spirits were Thunder (lEme’is) and Falcon (Endo’gis). Had Nancy wanted to become a shaman she would have called the people together in order to demonstrate to them in a fire dance.

A partial list of spirit places (sp[unknown]u’tuks) in Klamath territory is gleaned from my notes. As I made little inquiry about the southern and eastern parts of their country, it happens that most of these lie in the north. They are about equally divided between localities in the Cascade mountains and deep eddies of Williamson river. Undoubtedly some of the rocks described as transformed people, animals, etc., are thought of as places where spirits reside, but as I was not told that power was sought there I have not included them in this list.

Ge’w[unknown]us, Crater lake. People were stolen and taken down into Crater lake by beings there. Some say they have found no water in the lake. Instead there were rocks as big as trees and deep tunnels in the bottom. There are animals, snakes, and a sort of people who live at (or in) the ocean. Men swim in the lake at night to get spirit aid.

A second site is ma’kwal[unknown]ks, a point of rock projecting over Crater lake from the western cliff. The seeker clambers down and piles rocks on the point.

On the northwestern side of Ghost’s Nest mountain, which lies southwest from Crater lake, is a saucer-shaped bed of rocks overlooking the whole countryside. Lads built their fires near-by and lie in this in order to see a spirit. On the eastern side of the mountain are piles of four or five large rocks, erected by seekers.

Ho’t[unknown]kak[unknown]onks, Mare’s Egg spring, is six miles north of Cherry creek on the western side of Agency Lake marsh. They swim here at night. Once men found no water in this pool but a big man, with hair covering his body, standing in it. When they returned he had disappeared and the pool again held water.

Pau’usn[unknown]e[unknown]k[unknown]as, Harriman (?) mountain southeast of Mount Pitt. The Klamath say this is higher than Mount Pitt; indeed, being nearer, it appears higher. Two accounts pertaining to this mountain may refer to the same incident.

Long ago a Klamath climbed it, but he never returned, for he died of the cold wind although it was summer.

A Pelican bay man, who died long ago, once went to a lake on this mountain at sundown to seek power by swimming. He saw men in it, the backs of some, the heads of others. He was frightened and did not swim but went home. As soon as he started home the thunder began to roll; it pursued him all the way. He was afraid of it, so he jumped into Klamath lake. He sat in the water for a long time before the thunder left him. He became a shaman because of this; he had the thunder spirit in him and sang the thunder song. Finally people killed him because he became so powerful that they feared he would kill them with his spirit.

St[unknown]o’km[unknown]otc, the headland of Eagle Ridge, is on the west side of Klamath lake. Spirit horses live in the lake near the point, as instanced above.

North of Modoc point are two groups of rocks. The first, red rocks on the hillside a half-mile from the station, represents a bear’s entrails. Two big rocks somewhat farther north and on the plain are Wolf and his wife. When people mourn for a dead child, men go to the Wolf rock to seek power, women to his wife. They seek to be strong and to run well. They wrestle with these rocks.

There is an eddy in which they swim a mile and a half above the mouth of Williamson river, opposite the cremation pile on the right bank. An otter (k!olt), bearing stripes, is seen in this. Many spirit otters of this sort are seen at [unknown]k!o’ltamtc[unknown]is, north of Klamath Falls.

A channel cutting through [unknown]a bend of this river several miles from its mouth is called [unknown]ko[unknown]ka’[unknown]k’[unknown]ut. A man saw a water snake (called to’[unknown]k[unknown]e) in this place. It was as big as a tree and had two straight, pointed white horns. He told a shaman, who said that, the snake having caught him, he could not be cured. This man died in two days. While this story suggests it, I am not sure that they swim for power here. Another informant stated that at Tcoka’lwas, just above this, is a huge horned snake (w[unknown]is[unknown][unknown]k, snake generically). Possibly the same one is meant. In a tale the hero Wawiw[unknown]o’[unknown]k!os cuts the snake’s head off.

W[unknown]it[unknown]a’m[unknown]umpsi, black bear’s place, is at a sharp bend in the lower Williamson river (a mile above the highway bridge) overlooked by a high bluff. Long ago when men came to this place to swim they found no water there. Standing on the bluff they saw several bears below. Another man came to swim at sunset. He saw a bear standing upright in the water. “That is what I like. I will swim there,” he said. The bear disappeared. The man dived in but did not come up. He was found lying on the bank, blood flowing from his mouth. The bear had caught him and made him a shaman. So people try to get power there now.

K’tai’di, lava, is a cliff of that rock two miles below Chiloquin on the left bank of Williamson river. Seekers slept on this.

S[unknown]ka’mdi is an eddy in Williamson river above Chiloquin. This is a spirit place but it does not seem that they swim there.

Once I [Pat Kane] and my two brothers camped near there just before sunset. We were on our way to Klamath marsh to pick pond-lily seeds. My oldest brother started a fire while the younger fetched water. I went to tie the horses. When I returned, my brother who had been to the river said, “There are many beaver in there.” We took our guns to the spot. Soon a beaver swam close to us, only a few yards away, but we could not hit it. Soon two more came swimming close by. We failed to kill these. Then five came and soon so many more that they completely filled the river. My brothers said, “We had better not stop here. Let us get away.” We packed the horses and left at once. I saw the water shaking 150 and the sound of thunder. It took all night to get back. My oldest brother got sick; no shaman could cure him. He was sick all summer and in the winter he died. Neither my younger brother nor I were sick.

A man and boy were going to Klamath marsh afoot. The boy was six or seven. The man wanted to try swimming in S[unknown]ka’mdi. He told the boy, “If those things bite and kill me, you go home.” The man had lost his wife; the boy alone was left. “I do not want to stay here; I want to die,” the man said. The boy cried to him not to swim there. He walked back from the river bank, ran and plunged in. Big animals reached up and bit him. They came up twice; then he appeared no more. The boy saw it and wept. He started home; it took all night for him to reach BEz[unknown]ukse’was below Chiloquin. At this place the water boils and cannot move down the river. No one can swim there; something always bites and kills them.


The Power Quest

In a discussion of the vision in the Plains, Benedict points out that there is there a distinction between visions (quests in my terminology) from which sanctions are received, such as the success of a projected war party, and those by which a guardian is acquired. The former are of more frequent occurrence in the life of each individual. Among the Klamath every quest that is successful brings power that abides, not a sanction for a particular project. Every quest corresponds to the specific guardian quest of the Plains, though a guardian in the sense of a familiar is not acquired. So far as guardians or familiars can be spoken of, they pertain to shamans alone, since they alone conjure up their familiars to their aid. But theoretically, every Klamath who has had an experience could call on his spirit for aid.

The Klamath concept apparently holds for all tribes of the Pacific coast. There does not appear anywhere the Plains type of quest for particular sanctions. The spirits of the experiences are not guardians, they are not invoked for assistance (save by shamans), and they give continuing powers to perform the arts and professions or for success and wealth.

Accordingly, shamans are differentiated as a class more by their acts and the posesssion of powers to perform the shamanistic arts, than by the unique possession of helpers. This statement does not apply, however, to California, for there this is precisely the difference between shamans and laity.

The Klamath deliberately seek power by self-isolation and mortifying acts. Their attitude is that it is to be had by a voluntary quest, save in those rare instances which may be described as inheritance and in occasional involuntary dreams.

The terms quest, vision, and dream have commonly been used as though they were fully interchangeable. It is preferable to distinguish the voluntary quest and the involuntary acquisition of power; to confine the term vision to sensory experiences including seeing and hearing a spirit, and the dream to its everyday significance. These are, to be sure, by no means mutually exclusive.

The quest and the involuntary dream as sources of power have different distributions in western America. The quest is general over eastern North America and in the Plains. But as Kroeber has pointed out for California and Benedict for the Southwest the deliberate quest is absent and its place is usually taken, so far as individual acquisition of power is concerned, by the dream. I will attempt to define their respective areas of distribution somewhat more precisely.

From this point of view a distinction must be made between the eastern and western sections of the Southwestern area. Personal powers figure only in a minor way among the Pueblos, where priestly craft functions in place of shamanism. Yet at Laguna and Cochiti, at least, there is some occasional questing for powers in isolated spots. At the same time, among the western Apache, who have shamanism full-fledged, those who do not become shamans by the instruction of established practitioners, seek power in the same way.

West of the Apache the dream is the source of power: this is known at least for Havasupai and Pima. Havasupai shamans alone have familiars, which they acquire involuntarily in dreams, and even when they inherit the power it seems necessary that they dream. Pima shamans become such generally by heredity, or by being bitten by a rattlesnake, but they may also have persistent dreams in which they acquire power. Russell makes it clear that this involves no deliberate quest.

Dreaming appears with the same function among the Shivwits, hence may have been general among other Southern Paiute. Prior to the introduction of the Sun Dance among the Southern Ute about 1900, shamans got their powers in dreams without fasting; since then they deliberately seek power in the Sun Dance.

Dreams are the source of supernatural sanctions on the lower Colorado and in southern California alike, despite the difference of setting in the two areas. Mohave, Yuma, Akwa’ala, and Desert Cahuilla shamans derive their powers by dreaming of the great mythological characters, sometimes under the stimulation of jimsonweed, but not as part of adolescence rites. The Cahuilla, indeed, hold the boys’ rite but it is reasonably clear that jimsonweed drinking at this, or at other times, does not furnish the setting for acquisition of power. On the other hand the boys’ rites provide the proper setting for a majority of southern Californian peoples: the narcotic of jimson weed causing sensory disturbances which are interpreted as dreams of spirit beings, prevailingly animal in character. This is known for both Southern and Northern Diegueño, Luiseño, Juaneño, Kawaiisu, and may be inferred for others. The Kawaiisu, unlike their neighbors, administer jimsonweed regularly to girls as well as boys and with the same end in view. Inasmuch as the candidates for these rites do not present themselves but are selected, we have here a common basis of involuntary dreaming for the region as a whole. This is not to deny that the phrasing of the experience itself is markedly different among Mohave-Yuma, Akwa’ala-Cahuilla, and the westerly southern Californians.

The quest on the other hand is characteristic of the northwest. It is of course voluntary and the looked-for response probably always takes the form of a vision. The Klamath are a partial exception, which I will discuss later. The quest has been noted among all tribes for whom there is information: Klamath, Takelma, Alsea, Tillamook, Chinook, Wishram, Quinault, Twana, Nisqually, Snohomish, and Klallam. It is at the bottom of the initiation practices of the Kwakiutl and Bella Coola. In the interior, it is characteristic of Thompson, probably Lillooet, Nez Percé, Chilcotin, and Tahltan.

As these data stand the areas of distribution are quite distinct. The voluntary quest is characteristic of the northwest and the Plateau, as well as the Plains; the dream, involuntary in its occurrence, of the western section of the Southwest, southern California, and the southern Basin. On the border common to the two areas they occur concurrently, namely in northern California, southern Oregon, and the northern Basin.

In northern California the dream basis is clear for the Pomo and the Northern Maidu of the foothills, apart from Pomo shamans who are such by initiation alone. There is a suggestion that the Wailaki are one with them. All other groups have some kind of combination of dream and quest.

Northeastern Maidu and Yokuts hold dream and quest equivalents; the Yokuts stressing the quest in contradistinction to the Maidu. Sinkyone, Yuki, and the Sacramento valley group of Northern Maidu differ from them only in that their alternative to the deliberate quest is an involuntary waking experience.

Of the Paviotso, Lowie remarks: “A shaman gets his song and regalia through a vision in a dream. Annie says in the Walker River District there was a mountain where people went in quest of a vision.” This may mean only that the quest is undertaken and that the vision appears in a dream at that time, but I interpret it as meaning that both dreaming without a quest and the deliberate quest occurred among them. His description of the Wind River Shoshoni ideas, is, I think, more convincing as to the simultaneous existence of dreaming and the quest.

Shaman candidates among Yurok, Hupa, and Shasta experience in dreams, but for the laity there are opportunities to acquire power of the quest type. “There are, however, [among the Shasta] one or two very simple ceremonials, whose purpose is merely to acquire luck. For example, on very dark rainy or windy nights, men go out alone, and naked, and walk all night, praying for luck, singing, seeing strange things pass them, and having strange voices calling. Or on very cold nights in the middle of winter, a man will go out just before dawn, and after praying for luck, will plunge into the river, and swim.” “The [Hupa] men used to swim a certain course in the icy water [of Trinity river] and then lie on the frozen shore as long as possible that they might win great good luck.” “A Yurok man who wishes to be brave and fierce . . . . goes at night to a lonely mountain pond, swims, and is then swallowed or taken below the surface by a monster.”

The combination occurring among Klamath, Modoc, Achomawi-Atsugewi, Northeastern Maidu, and Chimariko is most interesting. The regular Klamath formula is that the seeker may have his quest rewarded by a vision, but the power is not obtained at this time. It comes some nights later, when in a dream he hears the spirit’s song. I am impressed by the fact that the quest experience and the dream are separated. Indeed the seeker may not have a vision at all. Further, dreams of the same sort, conveying power, come to one unsought. The Klamath notions seem to me most intelligible when considered as the amalgamation of the two kinds of experience. Those of the Northeastern Maidu are explicitly the same: a man on his lonely quest experiences the presence of spirits and on his return they appear to him in dreams. The Achomawi-Atsugewi case seems to be the same: “While he is bathing during the night, he may find something in the water, or may dream of it later when he takes a little sleep.” Again the Chimariko seeker is visited in a series of dreams, which were “often the result of solitary visits to remote mountain lakes.” Modoc ideas are appreciably close to those of the Shasta in that the novice has an involuntary seizure, apparently while at home, but following his inaugural dance, he goes to the mountains in quest of power.

Corresponding to the absence of sharp distinctions between shaman and layman in the northwest, the quest is open to everyone throughout that area. Yet there are some differences with respect to sex. This is measurable in part by the relative number of men and women shamans.

Men are more frequently successful in acquiring power than women and are accordingly more often shamans among the Thompson, Klallam, Quinault, Snohomish, Nisqually, Wishram, and Klamath. The evidence is quite definite on this point. Among the Tillamook and Nez Percé both sexes obtained powers: it is conceivable that men predominated.

The statement that Takelma shamans are equally men and women is perhaps significant in view of the situation to the south. Shasta, Yurok, and Wiyot shamans are chiefly women, with but few men. Goddard merely mentions both men and women shamans among the Hupa, and Dixon among the Chimariko, but Kroeber implies that they were normally women. 

Elsewhere in California it seems that men predominated as shamans; specifically Achomawi, Atsugewi, Northeastern Maidu and those of the foothills region, Yuki, and Salinan. In southern California, where the equivalent of the shaman is one who has had visions induced by jimsonweed, this situation holds even more stringently because the narcotic is rarely administered to girls. Yet in northeastern California the northwestern emphasis on feminine shamanism is reflected. Dixon observes of the Northeastern Maidu: “There were women shamans as well as men; the former being, however, more numerous in Big Meadows, where the Maidu come nearest in contact with the Achomawi, among whom women shamans were very numerous.” Angulo states that their number was about equal among the Achomawi, which is not a contradiction of Dixon. This implies that the Achomawi-Atsugewi and Big Meadows Maidu were both influenced by Shasta custom. Elsewhere here (Yuki and Foothill Maidu) women were rarely shamans.

The Period of the Quest

The Klamath deliberately seek power both in adolescence and in later life. In the discussion of the Plains vision referred to above, Benedict points out that it is there an affair of maturity and not of adolescence. Everywhere in this area, on the other hand, the quest may take place in adolescence, at a time sometimes varying widely from actual puberty, and in the majority of tribes at any time in later life as well. This is consonant with the difference in the result accruing from the experience. This is as much characteristic of Klallam, Snohomish, Nisqually, and Modoc, for example, as it is of the Klamath. The absence of suitable specific data makes it difficult to judge how far this is true of others.

At least among the Wishram and Achomawi-Atsugewi there is a difference; power is sought in youth alone and should the seeker fail then, he has no opportunity in later life. Descriptively the Kwakiutl align with the Wishram, for the novices who acquire spirits at the winter ceremonial of the secret societies are adolescents. Powers are also acquired later but the few references indicate that this is not common. The situation is different, however, for the Kwakiutl does not freely seek the spirit, but automatically acquires it at a time fixed by the round of a predetermined social system. There is a suggestion that the Thompson, Lillooet (who are described as identical with the former), and Nez Percé have their experiences only at adolescence. The Tillamook evidence is equivocal: from the very brief account we learn only that a boy of twenty is sent out.

The situation is different in northern California because of the dream source of power in place of the quest. Nevertheless, this might have been restricted to adolescence, but that seems not to be the case. On the whole, data fail for the region, but our accounts read as though the shaman novices were always adult. To take the Shasta as an instance: it seems unlikely that the novices’ experiences would occur to adolescent girls. Such at least is the impression, but we cannot be sure. The quest, open to the laity among Shasta, Yurok, and Hupa, is not restricted to any period in life.

In southern California, where a shaman’s career is initiated in the jimsonweed rites, this is an affair of adolescence.

The Conduct of the Quest

Basically the manner of seeking power is the same throughout this area. This is necessarily so because it means simply fasting and praying in lonely spots in the mountains, beside pools, etc. There are more specific details having definite distributions.

For example, the Klamath youth isolated on his quest runs constantly about piling up rocks: so does the Modoc, Achomawi, Atsugewi, Wishram, and Nez Percé. This is a wholly arbitrary and pointless procedure, unless it be thought that any arduous task will heighten the seeker’s immolation and thus hasten the benefaction. The Thompson have rationalized this type of activity (it does not include piling rocks specifically) as training for later life. The same point of view appears more widely in the comparable puberty rites for girls. Possibly related to these rock piles is the seat or little monument to which the Yurok retires to acquire luck in gambling or power to bewitch.

More significant than this, the Klamath dives into the water, where he is drawn below by a spirit. He loses consciousness to wake on the shore with blood streaming from nose and mouth. Diving for a spirit is a practice widespread north and south. The Wishram sometimes dives to reach certain under-water caves where spirits dwell. A Kwakiutl shaman’s song tells of being carried under the sea where he received power. In several Chinook tales the hero swims, is carried under by a supernatural to its house, and wakes on the shore. Precisely the same formula is recorded in an experience of a Klallam; here too, blood flowed from the man’s mouth. The Snohomish and Nisqually youth regularly dives into whirlpools, carrying in his hands a rock on which he spat, to weigh himself down, and wakes on the shore. I recorded exactly this curious procedure in a tale of the Kalispel. Boas obtained a legend of the mainland Cowichan which suggests the same form: an orphan went swimming and diving every day in order to get strong. “One day he made a fire near a lake and accidentally spat into the water.” He lost consciousness, visited the supernaturals below, and obtained power. While I think that it is hazardous to use incidents incorporated in tales as evidence of customs, it is at least suggestive in the absence of other information.

Southward of the Klamath the same practice of diving in mountain lakes, finding “something” in the water, and recovering on the shore is recorded for Achomawi, Atsugewi, and Northeastern Maidu. The case of the Northern Maidu of the Sacramento valley differs only slightly in phrasing: the seeker is rescued by his friends. Again, the Yurok swims and is taken below by a monster.

In view of this distribution it seems to me significant that the Shasta and Hupa seeker is described as swimming for luck; the Hupa man, at least, then lying as long as possible on the frozen shore. The Chimariko is briefly described as bathing at dusk in remote mountain lakes, and of the Wiyot we learn only that some people were pitied by powerful lake spirits.

The significance of all these cases lies in the recognition of a class of under-water spirits from whom power is to be had, and further that it is attained by diving to reach them. If we assume that Southern Maidu and Miwok shared the belief in under-water spirits (and our scant data do not deny it), the Yokuts case becomes intelligible as a southern outpost of the belief. These people sometimes derive their powers from animals or monsters inhabiting the water, and Kroeber, in fact, recorded the experience of one Yokuts who dreamed he was taken below the water by spirits.

Not the least curious part of some of these experiences is the notion that the effect is so great as to cause hemorrhages at mouth and nose. This was referred to above among Klallam and Klamath as a result of diving. It is also the regular effect of other types of experience among the Klamath. The identical notion has been noted for a variety of other tribes of this area: Quinault, Modoc, Shasta, Sacramento Valley Maidu, Sinkyone, and Yuki.

The Klamath are not at all reticent among themselves as to the nature of the experiences they have. Thus, one who has had a successful quest at once may sing what he hears in his dreams. On the other hand, a Wishram carefully guards his experience, betraying it only by songs at the spirit dances and by his personal taboos and behavior, and finally revealing it only at the point of death. These contrasting attitudes have different distributions. A number of Washington tribes align with the Wishram: the Puget Sound Salish does not reveal his experience until late in life, the Klallam and Nez Percé waits until the spirit dances are held, and there is a suggestion that the Chinook also maintains silence. Similar reticence crops up again in northeastern California: the Achomawi-Atsugewi never tells, the Sacramento Valley Maidu only as an old man. Considering their geographic situation we might have expected similar reticence of the Klamath, but on the contrary they share the freedom of speech of the generality of Californians.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual156,Shamans Performance,"The Shamanistic Perfomance

While curing of necessity takes place at any time, shamanistic performances are given at only one time during the year. This is a nameless period, the fourth month (December-January), in midwinter, the coldest period when the lake is frozen and the timber cracks with the cold. By this time all the earth-lodges are reconstructed and the Klamath are settled in their winter quarters. This is period of enforced inactivity, what with the intense cold, the deep snows, and their inability to hunt and fish. Furthermore, the seances cannot be held any later in the winter for then they begin to run short of provisions, I was told, which is undoubtedly true and yet may be a rationalization. This brings to mind the winter sacred period of the Northwest Coast tribes, with its quiet dictated by a fear of profanation. It is not sacred to the ordinary Klamath; spirits are sought at any time. It is significant only to shamans and others who have spirits.

Shamans make a point of giving their performances every winter. A number of them may join for the purpose. The novice waits for winter to prove the coming of his power and only after this does he attempt to cure. The advent of power is called dodi’[unknown]kalg[unknown]ot. Nonshamans who have a little power, perhaps a single spirit, may sing their own songs at a shaman’s performance if the spirit imples them.

The shaman informally invites the participants to his home for the winter dance. They bring food for a feast, especially pond-lily seed contained in large boiling baskets. This is left outside the lodge until the close of each night’s dance and may not be touched for fear of sickness. Children are excluded except from some of the sleight-of-hand performances. The invitation includes men and women, not necessarily relatives, who know the songs and are willing to help. A man is chosen to shout during the performance, calling the spirits from their distant homes to help the shaman. Another is more carefully chosen to act as the shaman’s interpreter.

This speaker or interpreter (lod[unknown]o’tka) functions both at this performance and at curing practice. The shaman always asks the same man to act for him; obviously an important element in his success. Nancy’s husband, for example, was always speaker for White Sindey, the berdache shaman. Older men are preferred and never women. The shaman holds his clenched fist over his mouth while talking with the spirit’s voice, and while he talks no esoteric language but good Klamath, he shouts and whispers so rapidly and incoherently that his words must be repeated by the speaker. This assistant also prepares and lights the shaman’s pipe. Evening and morning during the performance he stands atop the lodge and calls to the shaman’s spirits in the mountains. He is paid in blankets and beads. Clownishness is not part of his rôle.

The audience sits close to the walls, each family by itself. The shaman reclines on his sleeping mats which are usually on the northern side of the lodge, but sometimes on the opposite side. This is his place on everyday occasions. His family is grouped back of him and his speaker is at his side. He dances on the northern side in front of his bed or rather in the central space between the four posts. This is swept smooth and no one is allowed to cross it to reach the ladder, for instance, even when there is a lull in the singing. The singers are seated on the southern side.

The performance, called wa’hla, takes five days and nights, of which the first day and night are the most significant. They begin in the early morning with the fire dance. Five piles of dry non-resinous wood have been placed at intervals outside the central space. The pile to the south of the foot of the ladder is first used. The shaman dances on the south ([unknown]) side of the huge fire as close as he dares; the men who help him, dance on the opposite side. Their step may be a jump (sideways [unknown]) with the feet together, but I am not sure. Women may dance if men are few, but all the audience joins in the singing. As the fire dies down it is replenished with each of the four remaining piles in sinistral order, the last being that north of the foot of the ladder. This occupies the whole day and is not repeated during the five-day period. Its purpose is to call the spirits to act through the shaman, to give him the strength to perform the feats of legerdemain that follow.

The nights are given over to these shamanistic tricks. Two tricks, swallowing fire and arrowheads, are part of every shaman’s stock in trade. They are performed by the novice during the first night, though they may never be repeated in any subsequent winter ceremony. Until the novice has made the ceremony to show that he can carry off these two feats, he is no shaman and cannot cure.

The fire-swallowing trick (ko’pg[unknown]us p’an, torches eating) is performed with the aid of an old lake trout spirit (tew[unknown]im or me’‘y[unknown]as), or rather they say the spirit eats the fire. Five men stand in a row each holding a bundle of resinous wood slivers, ten inches long and two inches thick, called ko’pg[unknown]us. The shaman dances in front of them, others dance vigorously with him while they sing,

Ko’pg[unknown]us babi’s [unknown]gistsa’mpka
I eat fire while I walk.
g[unknown]eno g[unknown]ita [unknown]gistsa’mpka
This is where I have been walking.

The trout is represented as singing. The torches are lighted, the shaman snatches them in quick succession, puts out the fire with a gulp, and flings them aside.

The companion trick is swallowing arrowheads; this follows fire-swallowing after an interval. The fire has been allowed to die and is only rekindled as a little light is needed. Perhaps twenty obsidian arrowheads are tied at intervals on a cord, which one man feeds to the shaman as he dances. He swallows these with the aid of certain bird spirits, or rather the spirits eat the blades: gau’wi, a blue and brown bird, w[unknown]e’tg[unknown]otgis, a spotted hawk, and [unknown]k![unknown]ot’ia’was, a small sea gull (noisy, white, with forked tail and black spots on head). A tule mat is arranged like a cape over the shaman who now seats himself. They sing the songs of the bear spirit, now represented in the shaman, to bring back the arrows. Soon they hear him cry out, “ha,” as each = blade flies back and sticks into the mat. This performance is called st[unknown]opswa’lc.

A variant of this was ascribed by Coley Ball to a shaman of years’ standing. He performed it on each of the five nights, which a novice would never do.

I saw a shaman dancing in an earth-lodge. Then two men swung him around head down through the hatchway, each holding by a leg. Two men below held the ends of a string to which five obsidian blades were attached at intervals of a foot. He swallowed the blades and cord, and became unconscious. They rolled him in a mat, bound it, and slung the bundle under the slanting beams at the north side of the lodge so that his head was to the east. Then the women sang. Suddenly he cried, “ha,” five times and with each cry a blade appeared stuck in the mat. But the cord was not seen again. They took him down and laid him on his bed. Then he began to sing.

The morning following this dance everyone except the shaman goes to bathe in spite of the ice that may be in the water. When they return to the shaman’s house the food is brought inside and eaten. The shaman, however, must fast through the whole five-day period. The food, or at least the pond-lily seed, which has stood outside the lodge for twenty-four hours, is thought to be eaten first by the frog spirit, and until she has eaten no one else may. A young woman once went out to steal some; when she touched it, the pond-lily seeds turned to blood. This frog spirit is a big woman who is the principal spirit of every shaman.

When a novice performs, the following four nights are given over to singing and dancing like that of the first day. Experienced shamans, however, show their power by filling all five nights with such performances. Each morning there is bathing and feasting, and on the fifth morning they return home. One informant said that beside the speaker the dancers were paid for their assistance, but this was explicitly denied by others.

Pat Kane stated that the shaman’s winter performance, which he called ba’pie’nE, lasts only two nights and is solely occupied with singing. I probably misunderstood him.

Other shamanistic tricks are of the same order; various objects are swallowed, others are made to appear and vanish, or the stuffed animal skins in the lodge are brought to life. The tricks of plunging the bare arm into hot water and of walking on fire are unknown. During these performances no one walks about or talks except as he is directed by the shaman. These are all carried out in semi-darkness.

For the wood-swallowing trick, five, ten, or twenty small flat wooden splints, called w[unknown]o[unknown]kda’l[unknown]is (see above), shaped like arrowheads, are hung from as many strings. A circle of old men dance about the shaman each dangling one of these. The shaman goes to each in turn, swallowing the splint held above his mouth. Another night he brings the splints back as in the arrowhead trick, using a different song. He calls to them to build up the fire; they see the splints stuck into the mat with which he is wrapped.

Long sticks are swallowed with the aid of a sea gull ([unknown]k![unknown]ot’ia’was) spirit. This is one of the regular winter performance tricks, but the details I have are those of a Fourth of July celebration. Po[unknown]k[unknown]etdj[unknown]o’tk, a shaman, was hired by some whites to do this. He had a flat stick, six or seven inches long, which was lowered into his gullet by another man. One old white man seized him by the throat, thinking he would choke. Po[unknown]k[unknown]etdj[unknown]o’tk asked the crowd, “Do you want it to come back?” and at their response it jumped out of his mouth. 167

Shamans also have a trick of drinking huge quantities of water, four or five gallons, without stopping.

Corresponding to the series of swallowing tricks are several in which various things, fish, seeds, frogs, and blood are made to appear in a basket. For the fish trick the shaman has a man fill a small basket with water. They sing three songs of a big snake, those for male, female, and the young of the snake. The first song is that of the young snake. He then tells someone to look into the water. This man holds a light over it but there is nothing there. He sings another song, that of the male or female indifferently. When the same man looks again the water contains tiny fish (a’mpw[unknown]an y[unknown]e’l‘[unknown]as). After the third song, they see five minnows or several varieties of fish. He then tells this man to throw the fish into the river. Throughout the affair the shaman remains on his bed; no one goes near the basket except the man who inspects it each time. It may be that this trick is an incidental magical means of increasing the fish supply. A shaman is called on to bring the fish if they are late in running in the early spring, but the informant who told me this had never heard of the trick just described.

The pond-lily seed trick is similar. The songs are those of the big frog spirit (djEdje’l[unknown]istci). The shaman has an old woman half-fill a basket with water and cover it with a smaller one. He lies well back toward the wall during the performance, rising only to smoke. His speaker lights the pipe but is warned not to inhale the smoke. The shaman first sings the frog’s child’s (daughter’s?) song. One man after another talks to the various spirits that fill the house. The shaman tells the old woman to hold a light over the basket; nothing is seen. Two ([unknown]) songs of the frog are next sung and when she looks again the basket is filled with pond-lily seeds. All the old men look at it. When he sings the frog’s final song, she finds the seeds gone and a tiny frog in their place. No one touches the basket. This conjunction of seeds and frog is rather interesting because it suggests that there is an association of the two. It will be recalled that pondlily seeds brought to the feast cannot be touched until the spirit frog has partaken. It may also be significant that the attendant here is an old woman, for the frog spirit is conceived as an old woman and a woman with spirit power is necessarily old.

The spirit for the blood trick is nameless. It resembles a wild man, but was not described further. The shaman tells them to fetch a basket, part of the paraphernalia of another shaman. He sings this spirit’s song. One man told to investigate finds the basket full of blood. When he sings again, the blood disappears. All the while the shaman lies covered up far from the basket. Only the most powerful shamans can perform this trick.

A trick of quite another sort is that of making the stuffed skins of animals which adorn the shaman’s lodge move about as in life. A powerful Modoc shaman, Dj[unknown]o’[unknown]klonos (black sage-brush head), had little cottontail rabbits hanging in his earth-lodge. Sometimes they would run around as though alive; they were spirits. He had a stuffed butterball duck skin hanging on the south side. Sometimes this spirit made blood flow from the duck’s bill and at other times it flew about in the lodge. His song was

gle’g[unknown]otk sne’en
dead one flying about
nan[unknown]e’mb[unknown]omba’ktisnise’[unknown]en
butterball duck flying around.
Even though I am dead, I am butterball duck flying around.

Pat Kane described a performance which he saw when a little boy at Pelican bay. The shaman held a fire dance during the day. Then he told the people to place various stuffed skins on the floor of the lodge: mink, weasel, a shitepoke (tuwa’), and owl. He sang songs for each of the animals. He first sang one of the shitepoke’s songs and told them to watch whether it moved. It did not. He sang its second song and the bird walked around pecking at the ground. It had been a dried skin for ten years or more. He sang the mink’s song three times. The mink moved about holding a little minnow in its teeth. He sang a song of the weasel spirit. The animal rose and danced, holding up his fore paws. That evening Pat’s parents took him into the lodge again. The shaman sang the weasel song again. It danced as before; then it disappeared. No one moved. It was dark in the lodge; the shaman had two men standing on opposite sides with torches. He sang a weasel song, telling them to watch for the weasel’s return. Suddenly its tail appeared from the ground, shaking. He sang a second weasel song for some time and its hind quarters appeared. A third song brought the trunk, and with the fourth the weasel lay there motionless. Everyone saw it. The shaman asked, “Did you find that the weasel came back?” “Yes.” “Did everyone see it[unknown]” “Yes.” After this they had spirit singing again, so Pat was sent out by his mother. There were bad spirits coming, which might catch and kill him for no one could cure him.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual157,Curing Ritual,"Curing

Curing practice lacks the mise en scène of the winter performance held in the figure-decked shaman’s lodge, for it always takes place in the patient’s home. Nevertheless, it must be quite an impressive affair with its accumulating intensity as spirit after spirit is called to the assemblage, as one after the other they are charged with responsibility for the illness. Sickness in the Klamath view is due to spirit activity, the presence in the patient of an intrusive object rather than possession, and a cure (h[unknown]esw[unknown]o’mbli or tco’ta) is effected by removing and destroying it. There is no suggestion here of soul loss as a cause of illness.

Curing is possible only through certain spirits, including the fish hawk, falcon, golden eagle, buzzard, magpie, crow, weasel, fisher ([unknown]iwa’l[unknown]k[unknown]otcka), coyote, wolf, lizard, rattlesnake, a big sluggish snake (w[unknown]u’mEn[unknown]uks), and a woman spirit. Frog and her daughter, and the winds are necessary to the ceremony, but I do not know that they actually effect the cure. Other spirits were mentioned as non-curing: bear, bald eagle, clouds, thunder, lightning, sun, moon, and stars.

Shamans of standing are invited from a distance. When the services of a shaman are needed, it is likely that he is to be found at home. Shamans are expected to maintain a certain amount of reserve, to lie quietly at home, especially in winter. The summoner does not enter the shaman’s earth-lodge but calls down from outside, asking if the shaman is there. Some woman of the household answers in the affirmative, never the shaman himself. The messenger announces his errand. If the shaman is willing to cure, the messenger stands on the roof shouting to the spirits while the shaman is getting ready. This is a long harangue calling on the spirits in the distant mountains:

ya’m[unknown]oks da[unknown]k[unknown]e’lo[unknown]g[unknown]is tc[unknown]omgi’as
north earth step forward.

He calls to all the directions, every region from which a wind blows:

mowa’ksda m[unknown]ulwa’nki
south get ready.

When the shaman feels that his spirits have come to him, that he is potent to cure, he is ready. Then he decks himself with his medicine outfit (m[unknown]u’lwas), flicker feathers or grizzly claws, for example, and sets out.

The shaman may refuse to go, “Do not ask me now. I have no spirit; it has gone back to the mountains.” When a man loses a child, his spirit quits him when he grieves. “After a month I will talk to my spirit and get it back. I mourn now; I cry. I cannot sing and dance; my spirit has gone. Return in a month.” When the messenger returns—presumably the patient holds his peace!—he asks again, “Is the shaman there? Then I come to ask you to cure as you promised.” Now if the spirit does not answer the shaman, another ([unknown]i) man, called saswa’kia, mounts on the lodge before sunrise and again after sunset to call to all the spirits to give their songs to the shaman that he may again be powerful. The shaman tells the messenger to return that night, perhaps then the spirits will answer. At night the shaman sings several songs. “All my spirits have now returned. Go back; tell all the good singers and my speaker, for now I have strong power to cure.”

The man returns to say that the shaman is coming. They hang the doctor’s fee above the recumbent patient; a rope to represent a horse, or a blanket and beads. The shaman does not name his fee, but he doubtless gauges his efforts by what he sees offered. Before he begins he says that he will cure in two nights, or that they had better fetch another shaman for he is powerless to cure this patient, or that the patient has been poisoned by another shaman and he is not sure of a cure.

He brings his wife to sing, for a shaman’s wife is generally a good, loud singer. If they want one or two more to help him besides such relatives as know the songs, they pay them blankets, etc. These are individuals who can sing and talk loudly to the spirits. There is one in particular, called h[unknown]amto’m[unknown]gis, who prompts the spirits, shouting to them to excite them to work for the shaman. If the shaman’s speaker is not available, he will take anyone who is willing to serve.

The patient always lies with his head toward the east, the shaman sits or kneels at his feet, the speaker near his shoulders. The singers sit back of the shaman, the prompter near-by. There is no dancing during a cure. Children are excluded. Apparently the curing normally takes place at night, but it may continue into the following day. If it takes place in a dome-shaped mat-lodge during the day, the smokehole is covered to shut out the light. Baskets of parched and ground pond-lily seed in the form called cn[unknown]ops are provided. 

The general plan of the performance is first a series of songs to call the spirits to work through the shaman’s person; these spirit helpers then tax other spirits with causing the sickness in a second set of songs; finally the shaman tells what he has seen and sucks out the sickness.

The prompter first commands the spirits to come to the shaman. The first he calls is Frog, for this is the principal spirit, and Frog makes the shaman call all the other spirits.

a’ti[unknown]k[unknown]es[unknown]il[unknown]ke’w[unknown]oD wasi e’itc[unknown]omgi’s
Now you should stand there inside [the house].

Then the frog in the person of the shaman sings about the moving of the pond-lily seed upon the surface of the water as it boils.

t[unknown]en[unknown]eko[unknown]gi’so t[unknown]en[unknown]eko[unknown]
moving (?)

Frog’s daughter is next called, singing:

stai’las aino’liota’mpga
pond-lily seed muah looking at it.
ko’lamw[unknown]e’as liota’mpga
Frog’s child looking at it.

These two spirits then step out ready; other spirits follow standing there behind them. They are thought of as standing with one foot forward ready for action.

The shaman sings all night. From time to time the prompter shouts to the spirits to help him. The shaman halloos to his distant spirits, throwing his head back and muffling his shouts with the back of his clenched hand. Whatever the shaman sings or says, the speaker repeats. The singers (w[unknown]ino’tnis) follow the spirit songs. There is no drumming or rattling with these songs.

Now a spirit talks through the shaman from far away:

tc[unknown]okna’s[unknown]isk nas[unknown]iskwasi gal[unknown]e’[unknown]ks ala’hi
Now tell me tell me inside; dying show me.

Various spirits are named to find the offender.

tcaka’ni ig[unknown]e’ngi dak[unknown]o’newis i’adak[unknown]o’newis
Now you are the one, this earth. you, this earth [that gave the sickness].

As he talks the shaman covers his eyes with his hands, or rather the wrists cover the eyes, the hands are extended prone. This is called sm[unknown]etd[unknown]o’nwa. Again the spirit challenges:

i’ag[unknown]engi la[unknown]ki’w[unknown]itcis
You are the one, chief of the winds.

And again,

tea’ i’ang[unknown]engi [unknown]ke’lal[unknown]omwe’as
Now you are the one Earth’s child,

by which he means the spirit snake. So he runs through the gamut of suspected spirits. If it is this one, Earth’s child, it will have to give up the patient so that he can recover. The shaman’s spirit says:

ita’lg[unknown]eng[unknown]i’pka[unknown] ke’lal[unknown]omwe’as
You are the one who gave the sickness, Earth’s child.

If it is the shaman’s fish hawk or buzzard spirit who discovers this, it threatens the snake. It tells him that he will be picked up from the ground and destroyed, unless he lets the patient go. The snake is frightened and gives him up.

The shaman begins to suck when he sees with spirit eyes where the sickness is located. He never asks for symptoms; he can see. As a matter of fact, he probably knows all about the case, for an illness sufficiently serious to call in a shaman is undoubtedly a standard subject of gossip. Before he sucks, he sticks his finger into water and sucks it. Then he bites the body hard and sucks, crying “wann . . . .” while another responds “haa . . . .” as long as he can hold his breath. He really sinks his teeth in, drawing blood as he sucks. (My informant Nancy’s head was once bitten.) This is called ha’nsna. It is the spirit who bites with the shaman’s mouth and only certain spirits can do this: fish hawk, buzzard, falcon, magpie, crow, and weasel. Magpie and crow in particular draw bad blood from the patient’s body. On the other hand, the shaman does not suck when using a nameless female spirit, but cures by stepping over the patient. He interrupts the sucking from time to time to let the spirit talk. He utters his words rapidly and incoherently, while the speaker repeats and interprets.

When the shaman finally draws the sickness out, his head goes back, his eyes close, and blood streams from his mouth. If they want to know what it is, he lets someone feel it on his tongue or spits it into his own palm. The fish hawk spirit is stingy and sometimes refuses to let them see it. This is always something tiny: a bug, the nail of a frog, or the frog itself, a snake, a rattlesnake fang, or a red-shafted flicker feather. When they have felt it on his tongue, the shaman, representing the spirit, eats it. I was told that after showing it, the shaman (especially a woman shaman) has someone strike him five times on the back with a basket, but I do not know what the point is. Instead of showing anything the shaman may simply tell what is the trouble. If a very young child is sick, the shaman may tell the parents that it is because they did not take care of themselves but dreamed of something evil. Gatschet records a shaman’s statement, for example: “Therefore this patient was hurt because his mother ate too soon after dreaming. Then this patient turned his face to the spirit land.”

One method for forecasting the recovery of the patient is to tie thin nettle cords around his head, each thigh, and upper arm, the free ends being held by as many men. The shaman strikes each cord with a basket. Unless they are all broken the patient is lost.

A patient who has suffered a relapse is cured with the spider song, according to Gatschet’s informant. To paraphrase his text slightly:

Then the spider treats him; a piece of deer skin is the spider’s curing tool. Then by means of that deer skin he treats him; he cuts out a piece of the deer skin just the size of the spot where the suffering is located. Then the spider song is started while applying that piece of skin. Then he stretches a blanket over it and they strike it with shaman’s arrows (hänä’sish) so that it enters the body. First a particle enters, then it becomes part of the body and now that piece of skin looks dark. Then after so many days that black thing at last looks like flesh. 180

In the interludes of curing the shaman tells everyone to leave. He remains sitting in the lodge with the patient, silent, eyes closed, and smoking. His pipe has an unusually long wooden stem wrapped with a rattlesnake skin; the bowl is the usual clay or stone affair. (Possibly some shamans use tubular pipes.) It is lit by the speaker who is warned not to inhale the smoke else a spirit will hurt him.

The shaman may also go into a sweat-lodge for communion with his spirits, probably only when curing in the daytime. The shaman and his speaker are alone in the lodge; others wait outside to sing with him. When he comes out, he sucks the patient.

How long the shaman continues his exertions is indeterminate. If the patient is very sick, he sings until midnight or morning. Sometimes the shaman announces that his spirit has told him that the patient must be “doctored” for two nights; otherwise the sick man’s relatives must decide. Payment is made only if the cure proves a success; should he die within a month or two the shaman must return the whole amount. While I received no hint that a shaman is mercenary, the size of the proffered fee must figure in his decision. Fifty years ago the usual payment was twenty or twenty-five dollars in cash or an equivalent of clothing, blankets, beads, or horses. Ten or twenty fathoms of beads is the amount. Twenty dollars or one good horse secured his services for one or two nights. A man who has none of these gives a canoe, a suit of elk-skin armor, or even food, and if his only riches are marriageable daughters, he presents one of these to the shaman.

Shamans never practice in concert. If one fails another is called. If the first discovers that another shaman is responsible for the illness, the relatives will insist on the accused making a cure, if they do not kill him forthwith, which is much more likely. I was not told that a consistently unsuccessful shaman is killed, but it is very probable that he would be accused of witchcraft unless he retired from the field confessing his lack of power.

A shaman of du’kwa named L[unknown]e’‘l‘w[unknown]is was thought by the people of iu’‘lalo[unknown]E to have bewitched one of their people who died. Later when another was sick they sent for him pretending their need. They slew him with an axe.

Coville observes that “the dried root stocks [of the blue flag or iris (ghä’-gum läk’-[unknown]o, Iris missouriensis Nutt.)] are sometimes used by medicine men as a smoking material, mixed with white camas [wild parsnip [unknown]], Zygadenus venenosus, and a little tobacco, to give a person a severe nausea, in order to secure a heavy fee for making him well again.”

It is distinctly unusual to find that among the Klamath the shaman also figures in curing practice of a non-shamanistic, matter-of-fact variety. Blood is sucked from wounds and ostensibly from fractures; this is one reason for his accompanying a war party. The songs for this are those of buzzard and coyote, who eat carrion, of the wolf, mosquito, fly, horsefly, or any animal or insect that feeds on human blood and flesh. The patient is then usually turned over to a layman for further care. A fracture is treated by applying a cautery all around the spot, smearing the limb with pine pitch and wrapping it with wide strips of buckskin. Wooden splints are not used, nor sweating as a cure. Wounds are dressed with poultices of plants known to some of the older people. One informant said that only wounds in the limbs were dressed, but this is improbable.

Endj!a’yukts (the father of my informant Nancy) received an arrow wound in an arm during a feud. Although he was himself a shaman, he did not attempt to treat himself, but called on [unknown]E[unknown]kts’as, the shaman who was serving as the spiritual guardian of this war party. The latter pulled out the arrow, applied a poultice made of the leaves of an unidentified plant, and bound the arm. The wounded man eventually died of this wound.

Wounds made by a grizzly bear are treated by a shaman who has the songs of a huge spirit grizzly. The shaman prances about in imitation of the bear, palms raised in front of his shoulders to represent the fore paws. He wears neither a bear skin nor claws. This is the information of Pat Kane, but Nancy Phillips when asked about this scouted the idea. The only one wounded by a bear so far as she knew was a shaman, Po[unknown]ketdj[unknown]o’tk, who cured himself of a black bear bite. It is of course possible that he had the song of the black bear unknown to her.

There are no special rattlesnake shamans, but a shamanistic cure for the bite was described. While Jim Jackson was in the Modoc country a rattler struck him in the finger leaving a fang in it. He neither killed the snake nor cut open the wound as is customary. The fang traveled up into his arm, which swelled and began to be spotted like the snake. Po[unknown]ketdj[unknown]o’tk sang one or two songs and sucked out the tooth in a short time. He showed it to everyone after spitting it into his palm. It was minute and fine as a hair; one could not see it well. Next morning Jim, having recovered, paid a horse. This took place by day. This shaman also sucked a fang from the foot of another injured man. So far as Nancy knew, he was the only one who ever cured these bites and what spirit he used she did not know. The rattlesnake is the spirit of many shamans but they do not know how to cure snake bites.

There is a quasi matter-of-fact procedure for the bites, however. The flesh is cut away around the wound or gashed to the bone. It is then wrapped with a fresh snake skin. Lo’l[unknown]okl[unknown]is (Pat Kane’s father) saved his sister in this fashion, a rattler having struck her instep. She recovered immediately. No tourniquet is used. Men tie the rattles of snakes they kill to their hair, women do not.

There is a flat-topped mountain called seol[unknown]op[unknown]g[unknown]is, probably that southwest of Wocus bay on the western side of Klamath lake, on which is a pond where persons ailing from skin trouble and other illnesses are brought. They are laid in the pond so that the water bugs may eat the disease.

A shaman’s treatment for sore eyes described to Gatschet is putting a mixture of charcoal into the eyes, together with a louse “to make it eat up the protruding portion of the sore eye.”

It is desirable to record other medical practices here although no shaman is involved. The cautery is in frequent use; all my informants have deep burns on the temples or arms. Two or more sagebrush pellets ([unavailable]) are lighted and placed on the spot that pains. For rheumatism, for example, they are placed beside the patella. One is allowed to burn completely; when the other is half-consumed the sufferer destroys it with a pinch and throws it away, telling it to carry off the pain. The dry bark of the black sage is used for this, chewed and shaped into conical pellets. One informant showed me some prepared from the sage-brush bands used by mourning women and deposited in the trees, which he had gathered. Another informant denied that such bands alone are used.

Rheumatism is also treated with skunk grease rubbed into the affected part and the flesh of the animal eaten.

Earache, deafness, and hemorrhage of the ear are treated by the application at night of poultices of cooked wild parsnip root.

Toothache is [unknown]kima’dj p’an, ant eats, or literally d[unknown]ut ansma’SE. It is so called because on breaking an extracted tooth they find in it a little worm with a black head, believed to be the larva of the ant, which has been eating the tooth. The sufferer rests his aching face on a stout stick, a paddle for instance, while he sleeps. Some one strikes the paddle a sharp rap; the sleeper is frightened and the aching gone. Pat Kane ascribed this to the Klamath marsh-Williamson river division ([unknown]a’ukckni) alone. The river-mouth people’s (du’kwakni) method is to chew a bit of rotten fish, holding it on the aching tooth. The cure of the Pelican bay group (gu’mb[unknown]otkni) is a cautery over the spot “breaking the tooth.” Nancy denied the last two methods. Teeth are never extracted.

The Klamath used dog flesh in order to avoid smallpox (got[unknown]k![unknown]oks, erupting) on at least one occasion. This was during a winter before the birth of my informants, now in their seventies. Many died because they had so few dogs. Ordinarily dog flesh is avoided, but on this occasion the flesh was eaten and the grease rubbed on the body. Considering the date it may well be that this was a cure learned from French half-breeds on the Columbia.

For mumps, the root of a plant called s[unknown]k[unknown]oss[unknown]k[unknown]otkgla’ks is rubbed on the swelling. (This waist-high plant grows near the river, is blue topped, with large green leaves.) Mumps has no native name because of its recency.

For colds the root of the yayo’[unknown]ka[unknown]k plant, found in the mountains, is chewed and swallowed. A poultice of this is also applied to a swelling, then covered with pitch.

Coville noted the use of lodge-pole pine pitch as a remedy for sore eyes, a very small fragment being placed inside the lid, and the leaves of a shrub (ba-bäk’-bak-lha’-näm, Eriogonum stellatum Benth.) placed on burns to protect the surface from the air. He also observed that the roots of buck-brush (chäk’-l[unknown]o, Kunzia tridentata ), steeped in water, is frequently drunk as a remedy for coughs and other lung and bronchial troubles. The dry ripe bitter fruits of the same, mashed in cold water, are sometimes drunk as an emetic. Cascara (sär’-um-bäk-ish, Rhamnus purshiana DC.) is made into a tea for an emetic; foliage, twigs, bark, and berries are all used. Wild parsnip roots (pöd’-ch[unknown]o, Heracleum lanatum Michx.) are used medicinally. “In medicine a decoction of the herbage [of sage-brush (ghät or b[unknown]ol’-wh[unknown]e, Artemisia tridentata Nutt.)] is used internally to check diarrhea, externally as an eyewash, while the mashed herbage is used as a substitute for liniment.” The roots of stä’-mäk ( Wyethia mollis Gray) are mashed and used as a poultice for swellings. The mashed herbage of wäl’-wäl ( Chondrophora nauseosa (Pursh) Britton), aromatic and resinous, is used to raise blisters. A poultice of the mashed leaves of wä’-mi ( Chrysothamnus bloomeri (Gray) Greene and related shrubs), similar in principle to the preceding, is used for the same purpose.",1,0,0,1,1,0
Ritual158,Sweat Lodges,"Sweat-Lodges

The earth-lodge is so warm, at least at night, that it might well have taken the place of the smaller sweat-lodges. These however are regularly made, preferably beside a body of water into which the bathers can jump after sweating. The lodges (spo’kl[unknown]iks) are of two types, differentiated, it was suggested, for summer and winter use. There are now more of the former type in use than the latter, which suggests a case of substitution.

The “summer” lodge is dome-shaped and mat-covered, hence sometimes called st[unknown]i’na’c like the dome-shaped dwelling. Willows are set in the ground about a circle four to six feet in diameter, arched, and bound together at a height of three and a half feet. There are no horizontal ribs. Tule mats form the covering, with layers of green grass between to prevent the escape of the steam. When the summer lodge is kept for winter use, dirt is banked against the sides. The carpeting is of grass or leaves, green or dry according to season.

The “winter” lodge ([unknown]ke’lowac, a descriptive term?) is built over an elliptical pit, eighteen inches or less in depth. It is smaller than the summer lodge, and up to five feet in length. The roof over this is gable-shaped, the ridgepole being supported at each end on a pair of struts thrust obliquely into the margin of the pit. Sticks and bark resting on this form the roof; a layer of dry grass and dirt covers the whole. This stands three and a half feet above the ground. The entrance, which is quite small, is covered by a mat (fig. 20).

Stones, heated outside, are rolled into a hollow in the lodge. There does not seem to be any prescribed place for this, as among other peoples. The stones are said to be at the rear in the winter lodge, and anywhere in the summer affair, but in a winter lodge that I saw, the hollow was near the doorway to the right of one entering, and at the back in a summer lodge. For the use of five or ten men, I was told, a large summer lodge has the stones at the center. Five is the Klamath pattern number, but it was said that there was no prescription of the number who may enter at one time, nor of the number of times they sweat. Water is thrown on the hot stones after they are somewhat cooled, otherwise the steam would scald the inmates. There is a certain amount of rivalry on the part of those who have the water to drive the others out by raising steam; sometimes four or five have it at one time.

They talk to the stones when sprinkling them, asking to be cured, to live long, work well, to have luck in gambling, and to get spirits. This is the same as talking to the water when swimming on a vision quest. “The stones are ‘doctor’; the water is ‘doctor.’ ” They talk to the wind, the mountains, the water. Everyone outside is quiet. Men and women go into these lodges together.

Coville observes that “the branches and twigs of the ‘cedar,’ ( Librocedrus decurrcns Torr.) are often used in administering a sweat bath to a sick person.”

The three sweat-lodges used solely by mourners closely resemble the “winter” lodge. In fact, the lodge just north of Klamath Agency does not differ in any respect. I have seen but one of the other two, that near Algoma. This is now a U-shaped wall of stones which once bore a rough gable roof covered with dirt. It is much larger than the winter lodge, enclosing an area ten by twenty feet. It may be suggested that conservatism has preserved the type for this use, while for secular uses it has been, or is being, supplanted by the dome-shaped lodge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual159,5 Daily Prayers,"As we know, the five pillars of Islam are: The confession of faith, the five daily eulogies of Allah, generally known as the five daily “prayers”, the duty to give aims, the fast in the 9th month, and the pilgrimage to Mecea undertaken in the 12th month of the Muslim lunar year .

Whereas the confession of faith is not dealt with in the law books of Islam, the other four pillars, coupled with the necessary ritual purity when reciting the daily prayers, form the five religious acts or pious exercises that comprise the actual cult of Islam.

What place has this cult in the life of the Kurdish woman?

With the nymphs of Paradise, houris, awaiting the faithful in Paradise--an idea that only appears at the beginning of Muhammed's revelations  and is later dropped  --the Islamic woman, in our Western conception, is to some extent excluded from the religious life of Islam. The same impression is gained by a visit to a mosque. Whereas in our Western culture, most of the congregation that assembles in church on Sunday--the only day devoted by us to religion--are women, few women are seen in Islam's ever-open, carpeted, silent house of prayer, the mosque. When women go there it is only within a definite area barred by a low railing at the far end of the building.

If without access to a Muslim home, one therefore gains the impression that in Islam a life of piety is a matter for the men, yet it is only at the Friday midday prayer that men congregate in the mosque to any great extent. The men who visit the mosque daily and at several of the five daily prayer times, are those who in their homes or at their places of work have insufficient room and quiet to pray and to perform the prior, ordained ritual washing. Most other men say their prayers in their homes, their booths, or at their place of business. Kurdish women were found to possess a warm and living interest in their religion, but their piety is exercised within the home.

Among the women of the village aristoçracy in Topzawa, the five daily prayer periods were observed with the utmost devotion.

The midday prayer that begins the day was observed individually--not like the others, in concert--by the two adult women in the house and the 17 year old daughter shortly after noon and for up to one hour later. The prayer rug. b[unknown] armal . (E. 2254) of goat's wool, rectangular in form, 1.60 x 1.16 m. in size, woven in grey and brown natural-coloured yarn, wedge patterned, was placed on the floor in the three-walled room, the axis of which was orientated towards Mekka. The women tied the loose-hanging ends of their white head veil down over the head with the ends round their necks, so that the veil formed a hood which allowed only the face to be seen. If wearing shoes they stepped out of them, and with their bare feet trod on the hem of their long kirtle, thus hiding their feet. They then loosened their long, wedge-shaped sleeves that were either wound round their forearms or hanging down their backs, tied together at the ends, so that they fell to the ground over hands and fingers, which were thus also hidden by the costume. When these preparations were concluded, the woman adopted the first position of prayer and announced her intention of praising God, which constitutes the introduction to the prayer itself. She then raised her hands with the palms turned forwards within the arms of the kirtle until they were outside her ears and announced “God is great”--. She then lowered her hands and, with the right hand grasping the left wrist, recited the opening Sure of the Coran, followed by one or more passages from the holy book. She then bowed forwards from the hips with her hands on the knees, then went down on her knees to perform the double prostration of which the midday prayer comprises four sets, rak'a , ending in the kneeling position whilst reciting the declaration of faith, the ritual greetings, and turning the head first to the left and then to the right. According to Juynboll, the prayer can be divided into nine positions, the positions 3-8, that is to say six positions, constituting a rak'a , whereas Gibb allows seven position to each rak'a , as he includes the first standing posture and counts one standing position between, or as a beginning of, each rak'a .

The afternoon prayer, like the midday prayer with four rak'a , was usually said on the clay roof about 6 p.m., shortly before sundown.

On the other hand the sunset prayer with only three rak'a , took place down in the three-walled central room at about 8 p.m., as did the evening prayer comprising four rak'a at 9-10 p.m.

The morning prayer with its two rak'a took place so early that I had no possibility of witnessing it, my bedroom in the guests' wing in the courtyard being cut off from the family house.

The characteristic features of the women's recital of the five daily prayers were: the women acted individually, never in concert and not always at the same time (though, as the law prescribes, within the several prayer periods, which do not end until the next begins). Prayers were said in the home with the life of the family going on around the person praying. Children might be fighting for a knife in dangerous proximity to a samovar filled with glowing charcoal and boiling water, the son might be sitting shaving himself, with the only pressure lamp in the room placed on one of the octagonal smoking tables, the room could be full of talking, tea-drinking people, nothing disturbed the deep concentration that is necessary if the prayer is not to lose its value and be repeated. Nor did anyone present make any direct attempt to commit the unforgiveable sin of interrupting the worshipper.

Leach may well be right in saying that in the case of the Kurds there is a certain prestige in showing oneself to be a pious Muslim, and that this can be extended also to apply to the women's display of pious exercises, which in the evenings alternated with those of the men within the periods of the sunset and evening prayers.

The youngest girl I saw engaged in prayer was 17 years old; the 8-12 years old I did not see pray.

The humble village woman said her prayers at the places where she fetched water, where there was an opportunity to perform the small ablution. This consisted of washing the face, water being conveyed to the face in the hollow of the hands and then wiped off again by a descending motion of the palms to avoid splashing the clothes; the hands and forearms are then washed, the wet right hand being passed over the hair as a symbolical washing of the whole head. The ablution is concluded by washing the feet. At the same time the woman has as a rule first used the water basin, or the outflow of the spring from the watering place, as a latrine with subsequent washing of the private parts, so that, both physically and ritually clean, she can step onto the large flat stone, usually to be found at watering places, intended as a substitute for the prayer rug and of about the same size.

The women in the educated urban milieu of Sulaimani did not pray. I only came across one exception to this: my interpreter's younger sister, who was to marry into a family where the women belonged to the uneducated milieu, though the coming husband, like herself, was a trained school teacher, prayed industriously--at all events in the time preceding her wedding.

Among the uneducated women of Sulaimani one met piety and punctual religious observance, at all events in regard to the afternoon, sunset and eveining prayers. At an evening party the prayer rug could be lent to guests, opportunity provided for ablution, and then respect accorded to the devotions of those involved. I noticed also that the women of the village aristocracy at Topzawa were afforded the same facilities during their visit to an Iraqi engineer living in one of the houses at the Dokan Dam Site. Here guests performed the ritual ablutions in a European bath room supplied with hot and cold water. However, this was not as convenient as the garden basin at home in the village. The prayer carpet was then spread out on the parquet floor of the bedroom, which on that day acted as dining, living and midday rest room for the women of the company, the living and dining rooms of the house being used as guest house by the men. The duty to give alms, I saw practised in the aristocratic village home at Topzawa. Two beggars, the younger of whom, being blind, was led by his hand being placed on the shoulder of the other, both had sugar and flour poured into their begging bags, which they carried either in the waistband or over the shoulder. Two invalid women wore articles from the family's ample wardrobe before continuing on crutches their wanderings from village to village. The women in the sheikh's home, mother and grown-up daughter, were apparently not subjected to any restriction in regard to the fulfilment of this duty, which constitutes the Islam's third pillar, even though the men of the house, the sheikh and his younger brother, who also lived in the house, were away.

The result of this obligatory giving of alms in Sulaimani is that permanently-stationed beggars are able to exist on the charity of the men in the street. With a child lying in her lap a veiled woman sat on the ground like a black cone at the entrance to the mosque in the hope of benefiting from the sense of duty of passers-by. In the courtyard of the mosque itself, a feebleminded girl was deposited every day by her parents in what looked like a European perambulator, with a bowl between her deformed hands. It was said that although there was a public institution for both the classes of beggars mentioned, they were able to manage better on the alms obligation ordained by the Coran than they would if they entered the institution which, so far as I could understand, hardly ranked higher than our poorhouse of former days.

The ritual fast in the month of ramad[unknown] an began in 1957 on April 2nd. The thirty days during which the orthodox Muslim', whether man or woman, must refrain from eating food, solid or liquid, from tobacco, and from all sexual intercourse, from such time in the morning as it is possible to distinguish between a white and a black thread until sundown, I did not experience during my four months stay in Southern Kurdistan. Nor did I witness the concluding festival day, and the following six days, during which women who have had their menstruation period during the fast month and as a result of this condition of impurity were unable to comply with the fast, can rectify this omission.

On the other hand I did see a woman fasting on her own for a day as a result of a promise to do so, believing that by so doing she would bring good fortune to others. The day was July 30th, which, in 1957, corresponded to the first day in the month of pilgrimage. The fasting woman was the wife of the sheikh at Sargalu. In noticed that although she abstained from eating, drinking and smoking the whole of a long, hot day, the temperature reaching 122°F., where abstention from drinking, particularly, demanded an inhuman strength of will and self control, she attended to her domestic duties, which consisted, among other things, in milking goats, cooking and serving meals to a numerous family. Her fast was due to a promise given in connexion with the participation of a relative in a pilgrimage to Mecca, the centre and holy city of the Islamic world, a long, expensive and still risky journey.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Ritual160,Pilgrimage to Mecca,"We have now reached the fifth and last pillar of Islam, the pilgrimage, in the 12th lunar month. The Coran says in Sure 3, verse 97, that “pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who can find a way thither”. Out of the four feminine environments I experienced in Kurdistan, the only women I met who had undertaken a pilgrimage came from the uneducated urban milieu. Of these there were several. In a joint family that owned various shops in the s[unknown] uq and several large cars that were hired out, a woman, her husband and an 8 year old daughter had the year before taken part in a pilgrimage by plane Damascus-Jidda, and two other women in the same family group had made the journey with other pilgrims.

The most complete information about the pilgrimage was obtained from two women of about the same age who were married to the same business man in Kirkuk. Each had been a member of a group of pilgrims, one going the one year and the other the next. The one had taken a plane via Damascus to Jidda, whilst the other had gone by bus across the Syrian desert to Beirut, and then by ship through the Suez Canal to Jiddah. In the latter case the journey had taken about two months and had cost about 200 Din. (say[unknown] 200).

In the same way that the returned male pilgrims mark the greatest experience of their lives and their changed position in society by a white band around their headdress, so Kurdish women must observe certain sartorial rules after a pilgrimage. Even among women the head must never again be bared. The light head veil, särp[unknown] o[unknown] s , must be worn even in the closest family circle, where other women are allowed to dispense with it. The arm, from elbow to hand, must never be shown naked which is normally the case when the funnel-shaped cuffs are tied together and thrown over the shoulder. The two women in question had brought back with them coloured olcographs of the holy places, to be hung up in the home, and coloured silk scarves for friends and relations.

Whereas it was in the uneducated urban milieu that I met women who had undertaken the ordained pilgrimage, I had in Sulaimani an opportunity to follow in a mixed educated and uneducated urban milieu the feast days in the twelfth month of the year, which are celebrated in the homes whilst pilgrims are engaged in the visit and the ceremonies at Mecca connected with it, four days around the 10th du-l-hijja namely 9-12, which in 1957 were Monday 8th July to Thursday 11th July.

Pilgrims arrived at Mecca as early as Saturday the 7th (6th July 1957), and by entering the holy area, assumed a state of continence and religious dedication. This is marked by the fact that the men put on two untailored draperies, a shoulder cloth and a loin cloth. Dickson states that the colour for men is white, whilst women's dress on this occasion must be green. Women must not be veiled.

On this day the Mecca pilgrim performs the seven-fold encirclement of the ka'ba , the carpet-covered, cubic “Allah's house”, originally a heathen sanctuary, the corners of which are orientated to the four cardinal points of the compass. The encirclements, three of which must be performed running, begin at the black stone, the ka'ba being to the left, on the side of the heart. The black stone must be kissed or touched. Then comes prayer. The pilgrims now visit the holy spring, Zamzam , which gushed forth, a miracle, to refresh Hagar's son Ismael when he was dying of thirst. The seven-fold course between the two low hills, Saf[unknown] a and Marwa is performed in remembrance of Hagar, who here ran desperately back and forth, calling to heaven for water for her dying son, after she at the instance of Sara had been sent into the desert by Abraham. The course is finished by hair-cutting at Marwa , where the women sacrifice the tips of their plaits.

I had no opportunity of seeing whether there was anything in the families in the homeland that corresponded to the days' ceremonies at Mecca. A meal was given in the middle of the day in my interpreter's home; other guests should have been present, but were unable to come. This, however, had no special connexion with the pilgrimage.

The following day, Sunday the 8th (7th July 1957) pilgrims leave Mecca on a four-hour camel ride to the plateau Araf[unknown] at which they reach in the evening. It is recommended that the family in the homeland should fast on that day, but this is seldom observed. In my interpreter's home at Sulaimani, as in other homes, a special kind of nut cakes were baked, which were served on the day after, when visits were paid. These cakes were made in spoon-shaped, dual, wooden moulds, grooved inside. The dough was patted into a flat dise, which was laid in the one half of the mould. A filling of chopped almonds, sugar and raisins was laid on top and the dough folded over it before the other half was laid on top like a lid, pressing the cake into shape.

Monday the 9th (8th July 1957) the pilgrims spend in meditation on the plateau. It is recommended that a fast be observed in the homeland, but it rarely is. In Kurdistan it was Children's Day. Children in hundreds swarmed all over Sulaimani in new, miniature editions of adult clothing. The flock of children was composed of boys and girls from 5-6 up to 11 years of age. Swings had been set up on the outskirts of the town. However, the main purpose, for which they had been given pocket money, was to drive round in open carriages which that day were available for hire by groups of children. A traffic jam arose as a result of the meeting between the increasing car traffic and the crowd of children who swarmed about as though there only existed mules, donkeys and four-wheelers in the streets of the town.

Tuesday, the 10th (9th July 1957) is the first big day of sacrifice for pilgrims in Mecca, the actual id[unknown] u-l-qurb[unknown] an or qurb[unknown] an bair[unknown] am , that is spent in Min[unknown] a on the return from ‘Araf[unknown] at to Mecca. Hero sheep are offered in remembrance of Ismael (not Isaac), whose sacrifice was replaced by that of a ram. In addition seven stones are cast at three pillars of masonry known as Great Devil, Middle Pillar and Little One, recalling Abraham's meeting with Satan, whom he repelled with stones. At home in Sulaimani large flocks of sheep could be seen being driven into the town for sacrifice. It was said that a sheep or a three-year old heifer was sacrificed by all who could afford it. The age of the heifer corresponded to the idea that Ismael was that age when his father was ordered to sacrifice him. On this day also children are sent out into the town in fine clothes to drive about in carriages and to use the swings. At that time a public exhibition was held of children's drawings, done by schoolboys of about 12 years of age. Whether this exhibition was arranged specially in connexion with these days, or not, I was unable to discover.

On Wednesday, the 11th (10th July 1957) pilgrims in Mecca pass round the ka'ba seven times and run seven times between the two mounds, Saf[unknown] a and Marva , whereafter they proceed to Min[unknown] a where another day of sacrifice is celebrated. In Sulaimani family visits were made on this day. My interpreter's stepmother, with two adolescent daughters and three sons aged 13, 6 years and 4 months, went by hired car on a family visit to Halabja for several days. This is also the day for family excursions in the form of pienics in the park by the river near Sarchinar, where the town's well-filtered water supply flows between the trees in open canals. Here are arbours and camping grounds for the numerous members of the joint families, which take out with them everything required for a day's cooking: cooking utensils, charcoal, samovar, food and water melons. There the whole day is spent in cool and refreshing surroundings.

Thursday, the 12th (11th July 1957). For pilgrims the third sacrificial festival at Minä. In the homeland family and other visits.

Friday, the 13th (12th July 1957). Departure from Min[unknown] a with concluding stone-throwing at the three stone pillars. Then final visit to Mecca itself. The last encirclement around the ka'ba , and the drinking of the holy water from the well or spring of Zamzam . In the homeland, in Sulaimani, a thousand men assembled for common prayer in the largest of the mosques at midday. In the homes the women awaited the return of their menfolk and postponed the chief meal of the day until they arrived.

I have attempted here to give an account of the ceremonies in the home milieu that run parallel with the culminating days of the Mecca pilgrimage. How these days were passed by men in the town I was unable to observe.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Ritual161,Jam,"The followers of all branches of the Cult of Angels have ritual gatherings called Jam, âyini Jam , or Jamkhâna (spelled [unknown]Cemhane in Turkey), in a designated enclosure where holy scripture is recited, religious masters speak, and community bonds are renewed by the shaking of hands of all those present. Social equality is demonstrated by the forbidding of any hierarchical seating arrangements. The gatherings are closed to non-believers for fear of persecution, and the secrecy enshrouding the ceremony may have been the cause of the myth of communal sexual improprieties. The fact that women now are forbidden even to enter the Jamkhâna by some branches of the Yârsân is a reaction to these accusations, even though it runs against the grain of Kurdish society and its traditionally high status of women (see Status of Women & Family Life ).

The minor Jam ceremonies occur once every seven days. The all-important major Jam occurs once a year, at different times for different branches of the cult, as discussed under their entries below.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual163,Ceremony for the Expulsion of Illnesses for All the Village,"Ceremony for the Expulsion of Illnesses for All the Village

This ceremony took place in the morning in the open air rather far from the houses, and was carried out by all the medicine men /the English term is used/ of the village. They were arranged in a row facing east, and all had a maraca and a bone whistle in their hands. Some of them were carrying bands of rattles, either in the hand, slung over the shoulder, or hooked over the elbows. Some officiants were dressed in red wool ceremonial shirts spangled with rings of shells, and others in war shirts made of caraguata thread. Almost all were wearing red headbands decorated with feathers or hats adorned with ostrich feathers, and most had a bunch of ostrich feathers in the hand. The faces of the principal medicine men were daubed with red and black, and those of the women with red. Facing the row of officiants were planted several arrows, points down, and a lance with the point up. In the course of the ceremony a bunch of ostrich feathers was attached to the top of the lance. When I arrived at the spot, I noticed a young /212/ man crushing ha’tax seeds in a gourd which the medicine men would take later.

The ceremony consisted of a song without words, identical to the one the medicine men make heard during the treatment of illnesses. The singing was given rhythm by the rattling of the maracas, and, from time to time, by the sound of the bands of rattles and hoofs and blasts of the whistles. Each whistle blast marks a new stage in the performances connected with the ceremony (new metamorphosis of the spirit of the medicine man, as well as his arrival or departure from a given place). The maraca was sometimes held in a threatening manner as if to repulse an invisible being; the same gesture was made by those who held ostrich feathers. In turn, without interrupting the ceremony, one or another of the officiants took the ha’tax powder. One of the officiants ran behind and in front of his colleagues, dusting them from head to toe with a feather in his hand; he was assisted by another man, who made the rattles and little bells on their backs jingle. After having taken some ha’tax the officiants began to sing again, to brandish their maracas, and to make threatening gestures with them or with the feathers. Some medicine men were singing the song appropriate for their spirits, without concerning themselves with the recitative chants of their confreres.

The direct offensive against the illness followed these preliminaries: some individuals stopped out of the row, brandishing their maracas and feathers violently, and then returned to their places. Another began to throw up some dirt with his foot and was immediately followed by another who, seizing handfuls of dust, threw it in front of himself. Then one of them unsheathed his liana-cutter and began to cut the grass around him; his example was followed by almost the entire group, which threw itself into the assault on the illness. Some obstinately set upon one spot, as if they had at last driven the enemy into a corner, and beat it with redoubled blows of their liana-cutters or feather brooms, and then stamped on it as though they were burying their victim. The attack on the illness lasted rather long and was executed with great seriousness.

The follow-up to the ceremony was what we could call a general disinfection. The medicine men began by dusting each other off, making their rattles jingle right against the bodies of their colleagues, and blowing on the tops of their heads or the napes of their necks, as is done for illness. Then all the men, women, and children who had attended the ceremony as spectators were summoned. They sat down and the medicine men and medicine women /given in English/ came to pass their feather brooms over their bodies, to blow on their heads, and to make the rattles jingle along their bodies. These rites were carried out just as scrupulously for the children as for the adults.

My friend Sanchez was the object of particular pains; after the chief medicine man in person had blown over him, he was assisted by four medicine men, two of whom blew and sang over him, while the other two shook rattles, bells, and maracas .

Those of the medicine men who were not occupied with the disinfecting turned halfway around and repeated all the gestures which they had previously carried out. From time to time one or another again left the row to mow down the grass and furiously engulf the illness. The whistles succeeded each another at intervals which were ever closer together, and the rattles were shaken with more energy and insistence.

The ceremony was over when all the members of the community were considered relieved of the evil influences with which they had been impregnated.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual164,Tattooing of Girls,"There is one more custom which is practised among many Chaco [unavailable] at the time of puberty and therefore may be considered in this connection — the custom of tattooing . Tattooing is done by the Mataco and the Choroti in about the same way, the women being always and the men sometimes tattooed. The operation is carried out by an old woman: the skin is pricked with a cactus thorn or a sharp bone so that the blood flows, whereupon soot mixed with saliva is carefully rubbed into the wounds. Since the operation is of course extremely painful and makes the girl sick for some days, it is performed gradually, during the course of several years, the intention being that it should be completed when the girl is marriageable. Only the face is tattooed. The first marks are done on the forehead when the girl is about six or seven years old. In the course of the following years new marks — small circles, crosses, half-moons, [unavailable] — are added, and when the girl has attained the age of twelve to fourteen years and is considered marriageable, practically the whole face is covered with them. Since the wounds rubbed with ashes cause inflammation in the face the girl has to fast for some days after the operation.

Tattooing has a purely magical significance, as may be inferred from the fact that the Mataco and the Choroti women regard it particularly as a protection against disease. Analyzing the custom, we can distinguish at least three factors in it, all of which are associated with magical ideas: first, the scarification or bleeding itself; second, the matter (soot, ashes) rubbed into the wounds; and third, the patterns and marks incised which remain when the wounds have healed. Bleeding and scarification are common practices of purely magical significance among all Indians of South America, and as far as the Pilcomayo tribes are concerned I shall have occasion to mention this custom again in a later chapter. The very scars left after such operations are regarded as a protection against evil spirits. Further, that tattooing is done by means of ashes or soot is certainly not an accident. The use of ashes for superstitious purposes is of frequent occurrence among the Indians, the general idea being that ashes are a prophylactic against evil spirits. The custom of mixing ashes or soot with saliva is significant from the same point of view, for magical virtues are commonly ascribed to the saliva.

All women among the Choroti are tattooed in the same way, that is, have the same marks and patterns applied to the face, and no full-grown woman lacks this tribal characteristic. Since tattooing is regarded as a permanent protection against evil spirits and sickness, it is natural that a woman lacking it should be shunned by the men, but it is not a means of attraction or a[unknown] decoration[unknown] in the common sense of the word.

As to the Tobas, tattooing or the custom of making indelible marks on the body or the face was formerly in vogue among all Toba tribes as among all peoples of the Guaycurú-group; but the Bolivian Tobas of the present day have dropped this custom, contenting themselves with simple body painting. Tattooing among the Tobas seems to have been limited to the female sex, as indeed is the rule among the Chaco tribes. According to d’Orbigny, the Toba girls were tattooed when they attained puberty and became marriageable. Since the custom is no longer practised by the Bolivian Tobas I have not seen how it is done by them. The procedure, however, is the same as among other Chaco tribes, incisions being made in the face and ashes rubbed into the wounds. As appears from the photographs of some Toba women which Dr. Lehmann-Nitsche took in Buenos Aires in 1899 the tattooing practised by the Toba women was exceedingly elaborate and complicated.

The custom of tattooing, as it was practised by the ancient Guaycurú is described by Father Dobrizhoffer in much the following way. The Abiponian women, says the Father, 1 ) not content with the marks common to both sexes, have their face, breast, and arms covered with black figures of various shapes, so that they present the appearance of a Turkish carpet. As soon as a young woman is of age to be married, she is ordered to be marked according to custom. She reclines her head upon the lap of an old woman and is pricked. Thorns are used for a pencil, and ashes mixed with blood for paint. The old woman, sticking the points of the thorns deep into the flesh, describes various figures till the whole face streams with blood. The first day she is sent home with her face half pricked with the thorns, and is recalled the next and the next after that, to have the rest of her face, the breast, and the arms pricked in like manner. Meantime she is shut up for several days in her father’s tent and wrapped in a hide that she may receive no injury from the cold air. Carefully abstaining from meat, fish, and some other sorts of food, she feeds upon nothing but a little fruit which grows upon brambles and conduces much towards cooling the blood. 2 )

From Dobrizhoffer’s account it appears that tattooing was practised by the ancient Guaycurú in the same way as by the present-day Chaco tribes.",0,0,0,0,1,0

Ritual166,Magical Ceremony to Cure Sickness,"The procedure is always about the same. The medicine-man begins his treatment by spitting and blowing vigorously on the particular spot of the body where the evil is seated, and this action is from time to time repeated. This is done to[unknown] disinfect[unknown] the spot and to prepare it favourably for the extraction of the [unknown]arrow[unknown]. Beneficial purifying effects are commonly ascribed to the saliva, and a medicine-man’s saliva is particularly sacred, being imbued with the magic power which fills his whole body. Thereupon the conjuration proper begins. The [unknown]doctor[unknown] leans over the patient, closes his hand so as to form a tube, puts it on the sick spot and starts to sing, in a low muttering voice, a monotonous chant, ejaculating certain powerful words addressed to the evil demon. The chant mostly consists of refrains; it is evident that the efficacy of the conjuration is mainly ascribed to the voice itself and the breath of the curer, as well as to the very rhythm of the chant. The words or phrases uttered by the Choroti medicine-man are very stereotyped; in fact, they almost invariably seem to consist of the words: náuhea, náuhea, híame, híame . . . náuhea, náuhea, híame, híame . . . incessantly repeated, and only interrupted by the blowing, spitting, and other manipulations. Both words belong to the particular terminology of the medicine-men; náuhea means [unknown]at night[unknown], and híame [unknown]go away![unknown] The whole conjuration may thus be translated into: [unknown]When night sets in, go away, evil demon![unknown] The phrase has reference to the fact that the evil spirits which cause sickness are believed to move about especially at night, and the doctor is trying, by his conjuration, to prevent the demons from coming back at that critical time to molest the patient. Exactly the same idea appears in the conjurations of the Toba medicine-men, as we shall presently find.

These conjurations are varied with other manipulations, above all with blowing, spitting, and rubbing the bad spot. Massage regularly forms part of the treatment applied by the Chaco medicine-men, and is the only action which may really have relieving effects. — Ultimately the doctor again leans over the patient and starts to suck vigorously the bad spot. He turns away, spits and hawks up and behaves as if he were going to vomit. Thereupon he takes something from his mouth and, turning to the bystanders, shows it to them: it is the arrow, consisting of a pebble, a piece of bone, etc. which he pretends to have extracted from the patient’s body. The latter should now recover; but it may be that there are several of them in his body, or that a new arrow is sent into it which he will feel on the following night. Generally therefore the treatment must be continued for several evenings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual167,"Purification Ceremony, koyadanattí","As soon as it became clear that the patient could not recover and that death was imminent, the female relatives of the sick man began loudly to wail and shout. At the same moment as he breathed his last, his wife and daughter blackened their faces with charcoal, washing it away soon afterwards. The man died in the afternoon shortly before the approach of darkness. There was not, therefore, time to bury him the same day, as the Tobas usually do. All relatives of the deceased, who had lived in the same house as he, at once retired from it and left the dead man alone there close to a big fire previously made. The door of the house was then carefully shut and barricaded with various blocks and poles; even a catre (a sort of bedstead made of laths) was turned over it. Outside the door thus closed another big fire was made. At some distance from this the relatives of the dead man encamped for the night on the ground beside a third fire which was kept up during the whole night. The spot where they stayed was moreover fenced round with a great number of arrows stuck in the ground. Nearly all the inhabitants in the village, even the women, were seen to bear arrows or large sticks in their hands when they moved about outside their houses this evening. An old sister of the deceased appeared with an arrow painted in brown colour on each cheek. When darkness set in, a peculiar purification ceremony with fire took place. Some of the men now and then seized a brand from the fire which was made outside the house of death, and, incessantly swaying it round in all directions, they went through the village far into the forest, from time to time uttering loud shouts. After a while they again returned to the house from which they had started. This procedure was repeated several times, the men always starting from the fire outside the house of the dead man, and carrying the brands in different directions into the forest. This purification ceremony is called koyad[unknown]anattí .",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual168,Girka,"One final point can be made about the social dynamics of cult ritual, and that includes the differentiation and integration of initiates. During the girka ritual the poles of cult leadership are symbolically separated. The candidate is described either as a ’yar fari (lit. daughter of white) or a dam fari (lit. son of white) from the colour of the cloth used to cover the neophyte during the initiation. In this context the white cloth which must be devoid of any coloured design or intricately woven pattern symbolizes the social nakedness of the neophyte. The candidate is treated as a liminal person, belonging neither to any secular group nor to the cult. The initiation is conducted by a uwar girka (lit. mother of the initiation) or uban girka (lit. father of the initiation), but this senior medium represents more than initiation leadership. This role is performed by the cult’s local authority, either a woman or a man, and is symbolic of the person’s achievement as it is acknowledged by the membership. The initiation leader is assisted by a mai mukuru (lit. owner of a woman’s loin-cloth) who, as the translation suggests, is always a woman. The initiation assistant’s role includes a considerable number of ‘domestic’ responsibilities (e.g. the preparation of food and the organization of accommodations) and, accepting the general Hausa ascription of these duties to women, no man would be thought competent to manage the position. The two main categories of cult membership are hardly represented in the initiation ritual. Except when they visit the initiation leader’s compound as observers, ‘yam bori are not obvious.

The girka thus outlines the highest and lowest categories of cult membership, categories which are primarily based on achievement rather than ascription. Under the rubric of a cure the potential for any neophyte to become the most senior member of the cult is affirmed, since no other qualifications are applicable than an initial affliction and a subsequent perfection of the skills of possessiontrance.

The temporary focus on cult hierarchy so obvious in the initiation ritual is only dimly present in the periodic rituals of the bori cult, but the reaffirmation of distinctions based on achieved skills is continued. The cult’s leader at first directs the organization of his subordinates, but as soon as the possession-trance phase of the ritual begins such leadership is submerged in the general description of him as one of the ‘children of the bori’. It is often possible to identify the cult leader either by the social position of the spirit riding him or his competence as a trancer, but the complete equality of male and female mediums is symbolized by the conviction that spirits ride either stallions or mares with equal enthusiasm. The emphasis seems to be on the social unification of cult membership, the petty hierarchies of mortals counting for little with iskoki.


Initiation

In the previous section cult initiation was viewed from the perspective of social dynamics. We may now take a closer look at girka rituals as examples of diachronic processes closely related to the structural levels described by Van Gennep for rites de passage (1960). Elsewhere I have discussed a specific initiation in some detail (Besmer, in press, a) so parts of this section will be in the nature of a summary of that material.

An important characteristic of rites of passage is that they are generally associated with life-crisis events in which the ritual subject moves from one ascribed status to another. Birth, puberty, marriage, and death provide the occasions for which the shared characteristics of rites of passage are most obvious. However, it is also the case that the transition between achieved statuses is marked with a special ritual of the same type as described by Van Gennep. The bori initiation/curing rite provides an example of this.

In the minds of cult members the primary reason for conducting a girka lies in its efficacy as a cure for a spirit-caused malady. Illnesses believed to be curable by girka are extremely varied and range from impotence, infertility, insanity, and paralysis to rashes and boils. Each specific illness or set of symptoms is symbolically linked to the actions of a specific spirit. No less important to an understanding of girka but perhaps less directly stated in the actions of participants, the ritual identifies the recruitment of a new cult-adept. This is symbolized by the definition of a successful cure as one which results in the attainment of harmony or reconciliation between the sufferer and the iskoki diagnosed to have caused his illness. The continued obligation of the former sufferer to obey the commands of the spirits on his head is expressed in the description of him as a ‘horse of the gods’ as well as in the denial that a cured person has been exorcized of the afflicting spirits. In other words, girka is a two-sided coin: with cure written on one side and initiation on the other.

Examining the term girka this symbolic dualism becomes clear. One meaning of girka is related to girka (to boil). Besides indicating a frequent method of preparation used for medicinal solutions, boiling means heat or fire and thus covers many of the other methods of preparation. In an important sense, therefore, girka symbolizes ‘medicine’ for the actors. This meaning can be represented as follows:

girka boiling heat/fire medicine cure.

Heat also symbolizes body temperature and constitutes the most important sign of genuine (‘of truth’) possession-trance. A parallel meaning of girka is thus:

girka boiling heat/body trance mediumship.

Van Gennep observed that transitional rites commonly contain three successive and distinct phases of ritual time: separation, margin (transition), and aggregation (incorporation). Separation is distinguished by the removal and isolation of the candidate from his normal social and physical surroundings. During margin or transition the status of the ritual subject is ambiguous vis-à-vis both his former position and his coming one. And finally, aggregation or incorporation is characterized by a stable social state in which the new initiate assumes the rights and obligations of his status as a child of the bori.

Each phase in the initiation process may be examined in terms of its associated ritual symbols. These are represented in both ‘things’ and special behaviour and are striking in that nearly everything stands for something other than it appears to be. Ritual ‘things’, for example, include an inventory of ‘non-medicinal’ initiation materials ordered according to venue and temporal sequence; the ‘medicines’ used by the initiation leader with both general and specific properties; and the paraphernalia used during possession-trance performances. The behaviour of the participants-ritual subject, initiation supervisors, and musicians-is no less complex in the meaning attributed to it. The second and third phases of the initiation in particular have their own sets of procedures, gestures, music, and expected responses, and if any set is abbreviated it is believed the initiation will fail, that is will result neither in the cure of the patient nor the recruitment of a cult-adept.

The first phase of ritual time, separation, contains ‘symbolic behaviour signifying the detachment of the individual. . .either from an earlier fixed point in the social structure or a set of cultural conditions (a “state”)’ (Turner 1967:94). It is not possible to become a candidate for girka and remain resident with one’s kinsmen: ‘out-patient’ treatments are quite separate from full scale cures. The candidate, selected on the grounds that his affliction is serious enough to require girka is therefore removed from his normal residence to the initiation leader’s compound. All social ties and restrictions are severed, underlining the belief that the ritual subject can never return to his previous state, though the behaviour of his sponsors seems contrary to this belief, since they anticipate his eventual cure and return home. Except in unusual circumstances, however, this never happens, or it if does it is only as a brief transition to an inevitable change.

With the candidate symbolically isolated from the outside world within the initiation leader’s compound the real work of the girka may begin. This takes place during the second phase of ritual time, the transition or liminal period, during which the ‘state of the ritual subject (the “passenger”) is ambiguous [as] he passes through a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state’ (Turner 1967: 94). This state includes the activation of the ritual roles described in the previous section, special gestures and procedures symbolic of mediumship, behaviour symbolic of social structural ambiguity, and symbolic materials confined to the initiation ritual.

As mentioned earlier three roles predominate in the girka. The first is that of the cult-adept directing the ritual; the second that of the leader’s female assistant; and the third that of the ritual subject. The ‘father/mother of the initiation’ is responsible for all the arrangements prior to and during the ritual. He/she appoints an assistant, supervises the collection and preparation of the medicines and girka materials, and contracts with a cult musician for him and his ensemble to perform morning, afternoon, and evening throughout the initiation/curing period. The initiation assistant administers the girka medicines, prepares the neophyte for each session, cooks his/her food, and performs the special gestures symbolic of the mediation of initiates between non-initiates and supernatural spirits when the latter are called by the bori music. The ritual subject (‘son/daughter of white’) remains passive and withdrawn except when certain spirits are summoned by music and the first stages of possession-trance and then of dance are taught. At other times the neophyte is presented with the cult’s esoteric knowledge about iskoki, their relationships, characteristics, medicines, songs, and praise-epithets, but except as necessary for an adequate demonstration of possession-trance no mastery of this is required.

During the liminal or transition period the neophyte is regarded as completely helpless and must be spoon-fed by the initiation assistant. From the perspective of the social structure the ritual subject is invisible, a non-person. Any personal property which might suggest rank or kinship position is forbidden and the single piece of clothing, a body wrapper, which the neophyte brings to the girka must be given to the initiation assistant at the conclusion of the ritual. Invisibility is further emphasized by removal from all social activities-for example, conversations are conducted as though the neophyte were not present -and the ritual subject is covered (hidden) with a blanket when the musicians invoke the spirits.

Before the musicians begin to play, the initiation assistant prepares the site as well as the neophyte for the session. At the initiation site she places a grass mat upside down (the unpolluted side) with the top of the mat pointing east (the direction of the spirit world of Jangare) and stands at the back of the candidate, holding his hands behind him. In this position the pair walk around the mat, then across its length, and its width, each three times. With this greeting to the spirits concluded the initiation assistant seats the candidate on the mat, facing east, his legs outstretched, and puts into his hands a special initiation charm ( dada or ’ya ) consisting of secret medicines wrapped in a small piece of white, handwoven cloth and ornamented with cowrie shells. Another, smaller, initiation charm is tied around the neophyte’s chest to ensure that the ritual will result in a cure, and a small chicken feather is stuck in his hair over his right temple. The initiation assistant then ties the ritual subject’s big toes together and with another piece of cloth or twine, his thumbs together. Finally, she covers the candidate with a white, handwoven cloth, tucking it in all around, and seats herself to the candidate’s right, facing north.

The ritual subject’s posture and orientation are symbolic of complete submission to the will of the spirits which have caused the affliction. Divine horsemen are believed to prefer to mount an ‘unbroken’ horse which is both concealed and hobbled, so that thus prepared, there should be no reason why even the most sensitive spirit would decline the invitation. The slight vibration of the chicken feather in the candidate’s hair is a sign that a spirit is on his neck and may be spoken to through him.

The liminal phase is expected to last for six days, but up to thirteen may be required to assure that all the afflicting spirits have had a chance to indicate their attitude towards the ritual subject. During this period the cult musicians play three times a day, beginning each performance with the songs for Sarkim Makada and concluding with those for Nakada, representative of public possession-trance order. For the first three days the songs in between are for pagan or black spirits, and it is considered improper to speak when these malevolent spirits are invoked. To do so would be to encourage one of them to possess the candidate permanently, and because of their potential for destructiveness this would be unfortunate. Therefore, as each of these spirits’ songs is completed with a minimum of activity the initiation assistant ‘buries’ the spirit with the motion of a tumfafiya (shrub; Calotropis procera ) wand. The stick touches the neophyte’s head, moves down the taut cover to his feet, and then touches the ground. This gesture is effective in coaxing the spirit off the neophyte’s head and directing it to dismount.

On the morning of the fourth day the musicians play songs for spirits which live in the east, that is white or Muslim spirits. As each of these spirits is called the initiation masters ask its help in making the ritual subject well, repenting on his behalf for anything which may have offended it. Putting his head under the blanket covering the ritual subject, the initiation leader asks the spirit if it is prepared to sit peacefully on the candidate. To help the spirit speak through the candidate’s mouth the initiation leader rubs the candidate’s teeth with a silver ring or a hen’s egg. If no answer is forthcoming the initiation leader affirms to the spirit that while it is known that mortals do not have the power to drive a spirit away they cannot be prevented from begging it to go in peace. With the questionable spirit thus appeased the movement of the tumfafiya wand down the neophyte’s cover provides the signal for the musicians to change their playing and call another spirit.

There is some disagreement about who decides when the music is to be changed. Initiation masters claim they direct the change by dismissing the previous spirit with the motion of the initiation wand. Musicians, on the other hand, say they signal the change with musical cadences. The determination of the person responsible for the decision is important in understanding whether or not cult-adepts control the flow even of an initiation performance. It is probable that the decision is made jointly by initiates and non-initiates (musicians). It would be dangerous for a musician to dismiss a spirit (musically) before it had been formally honoured by the initiation leader, so in girka performances especially musicians must pay close attention to the verbal cadences of cult initiates.

If, while under the neophyte’s cover, the initiation leader sees the chicken feather in his hair beginning to vibrate and his body to tremble and perspire, he knows that spirit is willing to speak through the neophyte’s mouth. Such behaviour on the part of the ritual subject is, of course, early evidence of an altered state of consciousness during which the ritual subject will serve as the spirit’s medium. If an answering spirit refuses to sit at peace or otherwise rejects the candidate it is not thought to be particularly serious. Its help is requested and after an appropriate interval it is ‘buried’. If the spirit agrees not to harm the candidate a promise is made, before the next spirit is called, that he will always be its devoted horse.

As this liminal phase continues the spirits have agreed to sit at peace with the ritual subject and will therefore be left on his head, take greater and greater possession of him as they are called for each session. Even as the candidate first responds to efforts to induce him into a trance state his eventual cure is predicted. As the first signs of possession-trance appear the initiation leader directs that his fingers and toes are untied. Thus freed, the neophyte’s hands may be expected to move suddenly from his lap and out to the ground at his sides. Even more encouraging to the participants is when the ritual subject begins to perspire and quiver and then stands and falls backwards to the mat in a seated position. These falls, which are allowed to occur in sets of three, are interpreted as the spirit’s greeting to the initiation assembly and symbolize the other goal of the girka ritual, the recruitment of a cult member. The liminal phase draws to a conclusion as the candidate’s skill in entering and deepening posession-trance is developed and the songs, praises, social relationships, gestures, and dances of the spirits on his head are emphasized.

It should be clear that possession-trance is one dominant symbol in girka. The other dominant symbol is healing. Between the sessions during which the musicians perform to invoke spirits the ritual subject is treated with special medicinal preparations designed to promote the relaxation of the symptoms of his affliction and reconcile him with the afflicting spirits. These medicines are believed to have three aims. The first is represented by preparations used to treat the ritual subject’s primary illness and contains items symbolically associated with the spirit diagnosed to have caused it. The second is administered for protection against illnesses caused by other spirits which have selected the candidate, and these are usually kinsmen of the primary afflicting spirit. The third type is given in a general way to protect the candidate from the dangers of possessiontrance and from any other spirit-caused malady. Each of these preparations is for one of four uses: to be drunk ( sha ), washed with ( wanka ), rubbed ( shafe ), or burned as incense ( turare ). The ingredients for these preparations are commonly transformed into medicines through the application of heat or fire or natural fermentation (which produces heat); a conspicuous theme of the girka ritual.

In organizing medicines aimed at treating the sufferer’s primary illness it is important to identify the particular spirit causing the trouble. A vague outline of the spirit’s identity can be predicted through matching the candidate’s affliction with those defined by the broad vertical social structures of the spirit world, its houses. Fulani spirits, for example, cause either ‘aimless wandering’ if they are male or paralysis if female. Spirits from Sarkin Arna’s house cause anti-Muslim behaviour and Gwari spirits non-Muslim behaviour coupled with neck or back swelling. The final determination of the name of the spirit causing the affliction is made through direct questioning by the initiation leader during girka sessions.

General medicinal preparations effective in the treatment of the affliction’s broad characteristics (i.e. those which are appropriate to an entire family of spirits) are used until the specific cause (spirit) is revealed. After it is known which spirit has claimed responsibility for the illness ingredients specific to it are used. For some items no explanation could be given for their inclusion, but for others the symbolism is clear. Particularly ‘meaningful’ ingredients are those which stand for the spirit in one of a variety of ways: as already noted, parts of plants in which it likes to rest or which grow near its favourite sleeping places; dirt or waste material gathered from places it likes to visit; and items which have the same name as the spirit or share with it some common characteristic (colour, texture, praise-name, shape, etc.); ingredients associated with its favourite kinsmen or bond-friends in Jangare; and things associated with either its craft or social position.

Once a victim has been afflicted by one spirit others can be expected to have joined it. Ritual subjects, therefore, are treated with preparations specific to these assisting spirits as they are determined during the girka sessions. A final group of preparations is used to protect the candidate from the potentially harmful effects of possession-trance. Some divine horsemen are known to be particularly demanding of their mounts, forcing them to jump from high places,. perform an assortment of acrobatics, or submit to a variety of tests of endurance, so that specific medicines are administered to ‘toughen’ the candidate. Many of these are preserved in medicine belts to be worn by the ritual subject as he demonstrates possession-trance.

The final phase of a rite of passage is incorporation. As Turner observed, in the third phase the passage is consummated. The ritual subject . . . is in a stable state once more and, by virtue of this, has rights and obligations of a clearly defined and “structural” type, and is expected to behave in accordance with certain customary norms and ethical standards’ (1967: 94). The incorporation phase of a girka ritual focuses on a public possession-trance performance described either as a kwanan zaune (lit. night spent sitting up) or a wasa na hira 8   (lit. entertainment for chatting) but also includes a final ritual washing, special gift-giving, and a sacrifice. During the possession-trance ceremony the ritual subject is displayed as a ‘cured’ person and is referred to as a horse of the gods rather than as a neophyte. To merit this description the new initiate must demonstrate possession-trance during the event, and for the first time when the spirits on his neck ride, the ritual paraphernalia associated with each of them are tied to him by strong knots. Even if his altered state is shallow his status as a medium is recognized. An interesting aspect of the performance is that mediums for the same spirits as those on the new horses’s neck dance with him, instructing him in the finer points of their spirits’ favourite dances and gestures. Lack of skill in the new initiate’s performance does not invalidate the event.

After this performance which usually takes place after the beginning of the seventh day of the girka (nightfall of the sixth) the new initiate ritually washes from head to toe, gives a few special gifts to the initiation assistant, and sponsors the sacrifice of an animal prescribed for the primary spirit on his head. Of all these the washing, which appears obviously connected with the new initiate’s non-status as a ritual subject, at first seems out of place. However, its clear placement within the incorporation phase becomes apparent with the statement that the new initiate ‘washes himself’; the action is connected with what a horse must do upon return from an altered state of consciousness.

Then the initiate must give the wrapper, food and water bowls, and ladle which he had been required to provide for the girka to the initiation assistant. These objects are polluted for the initiate, symbolizing his helplessness during the girka’s liminal phase, but none the less, they are his. Giving them to the initiation assistant provides a solution to the problem of their disposal and emphasizes the conviction that they will never again be needed. This social distance from the girka is further increased by the requirement that the new initiate shall not enter any initiation place, which clearly accounted for the absence of any cult-adepts except his initiation masters, at his own girka.

Finally, the initiate must provide a sacrifice to sustain the spirits who have been instrumental in his cure, as all initiates are expected to do when the gods have shown them special favour. This sacrifice provides a curious mixture of Muslim and non-Muslim symbolism. The animal must be butchered according to Muslim law (made to take a drink of water, face east, and its jugular vein cut with a steel knife), but it is directed to iskoki and not Allah. The blood is collected in a shallow hole where it is left for spirits to drink, and, as we have noted previously, the meat must be given away as alms, the recipients validating the offering by their acceptance of it, while the skin, head, and feet are given to Sarkim Makada’s mortal representatives, the cult musicians.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual169,Periodic Possession-Trance Ceremonies,"Periodic Possession-Trace Performances

As suggested above one of the obligations of a cult-adept is regularly to provide his services as a mount for the spirits on his head. There, perhaps, psychological or psychiatric reasons why a medium should feel this pressure to enter possessiontrance, but for the purposes of the cult these reasons are translated into social terms. To maintain or increase one’s status placement in the possession-trance cult one must be a willing participant at cult performances. So far as could be determined in the present data the occasions for possession-trance performances which are prompted purely by cult stimuli are relatively few. In fact the only public performance described as unrelated to any external event or invitation, except for those performances which are a part of initiation/curing rituals, is a harvest ceremony called fasa kabewa (lit. smashing a pumpkin). Held after the harvest of pumpkins (long after the harvesting of all types of corn) and at any other time when cult solidarity is demanded, the smashing of a ceremonial pumpkin by Sarkin Rafi is said to be symbolic of an agricultural people’s gratitude for a bountiful harvest and, since the pumpkin itself is believed to have special medicinal properties, of the power of cult medicines and mediumship. The only other type of performance held specifically for cult purposes is not open to the public as it takes place within the walls of an adept’s secluded compound. When a spirit has turned against a devotee it may be necessary to hold a special performance in which male cult musicians play to quiet a spirit’s unrest ( kidan juyi : lit. drumming for a change of state). 

Of the ‘external’ events which are frequently used to justify public possession-trance performances the week of wedding festivities is the most common. In the case of weddings it is generally a member of the bride’s family who asks cult musicians and adepts to perform for one or more of the observances during the week: the ‘capture’ of the bride ( kamar amarya ); the removal of the bride to the house of an older, matrilaterally related woman (usually her mother’s sister), where henna is applied to her hands and feet ( kunshi ); the bringing of the bride to the groom’s house on Thursday evening where guests sit up the entire night, talking, playing cards, or watching a possession-trance performance (kwanan zaune); and the distribution of gifts by the bride’s family on Friday afternoon ( wuni ) (Besmer 1975: 107-8). Kwanan zaune and wuni are sometimes spoken of collectively as biki (feast), and when possession-trance performances are kept to a minimum may be the only two wedding-related events for which a cult performance is requested.

Two other events may also find devotees demonstrating mediumship. One is ordinary naming ceremonies ( wasan suna ), particularly for children born to devotees or cult sympathizers, and the other is for the Mulim festivals of Id al-fitr and Id al-Kabir. Kwanan zaune na salla and wasar salla are held in a semiprivate section of the emir’s palace or in front of the emir’s mother’s compound during the eight evenings marking the Festival octave. Held with the emir’s tacit approval, although not at his specific request, salla performances serve the double purpose of giving Muslim spirits the chance to ride in the festival parade and of assuring non-Muslim spirits they have not been forgotten.

A story is told of a palace guard who refused to allow bori people to hold this latter series of performances, claiming that they were anti Muslim and a disgrace. Unsuccessful in their attempts to impress upon him the necessity of holding the performances, the musicians and adepts withdrew, knowing that some evil was sure to be visited upon the guard by the spirits lurking in the palace. Later that night it was reported that he had been seized by the neck, lifted into the air, and thrown to the ground, dead. His replacement was not so foolish and allowed the children of the bori to enter the gate the next night. The emir took no part in this dispute and no prosecution of any cult-adept followed. Bori people knew that the guilty ones were not mortals but palace iskoki.

For possession-trance to occur at any of these ceremonies spirits must be invoked by means of special melodies and rhythms played on one of a number

is given either to a member of the cult or a cult musician, depending on the giver’s affinity with either group. The receiver organizes the participation of selected musicians and trancers by sharing the host’s gift with them. At all levels of this formalized gift-giving the obligation to accept the gift is considerable, and once accepted there is virtually no way to avoid participating in the event.

There is one important rule of exception built into the gift-giving aspect of a ceremony’s preparation. When the host or principal redistributor (a senior musician or adept) and a potential receiver have previously established some sort of social relationship, or when the redistributor and the receiver both have cult status, it is possible that the gift may be replaced by obligation. Instead of receiving a portion of the calling gift, the potential participant may simply accept a verbal invitation and use his acceptance as a lever in some future transaction or for the satisfaction of a prior social debt. In the case of such exceptions the permanence of various interlocking social relationships is emphasized, and in fact the obligation ledger is never allowed to balance.

The other part of the preparations, the invitations to the guests, falls into two categories, depending on whether or not the performance is to be part of the week of wedding festivities. If a wedding is involved the announcement for any specific performance is spread to the guests who would ordinarily be expected to attend the event even if no bori was to be performed. For example, at the performance identified by the staining of the bride’s hands and feet with henna it would be considered inappropriate for the friends and relatives of the groom to attend even if they were cult sympathizers. 14   Because of their leadership and due to the fact that the cult performances are tied to rituals identified with the bride, it is clear that the bride’s representatives play a more active role in this week than those of the groom. The mai kira (caller) is usually from the bride’s kin, and along with others of the bride’s family, her obligation to be generous especially towards musicians is great. When both groups, represented principally by their women, are present at a performance (typically, those which take place Thursday night and Friday afternoon), they divide themselves spatially, the groom’s kin sitting on one side of the playing area and the bride’s kin on the other.

Possession-trance performances which are not part of any wedding ceremony still maintain the essential division between hosts and guests. The entire performance and the way in which gifts are given to third parties establishes or reaffirms a social relationship between the principal participants. Perhaps unaware of this social undercurrent, many such performances have been described as ‘entertainment’ (which they certainly are), but their importance as events in which obligations are created and reciprocated cannot be overlooked.

The second broad constituent of a possession-trance performance is identified by the beginning and ending of the musical accompaniment. Informants make a distinction between performances intended to include demonstrations of possession-trance (kidam bori) and those which do not (kidan wasa). It will be recalled that performances with trance are conducted so that devotees either enter trance together with the playing of one trance-inducing piece of music or enter trance one after the other with a series of separate, spirit-associated pieces.

All these performances share a number of common initial elements. According to musicians, the kola nuts which served to call them to the event are only useful in obliging them to appear. A generous host recognizes this and

trance in’. Shortly after this Nakada’s music is played and ‘closes the door’ of the performance.

However, if the caller approaches the musicians with a tray of kola nuts, candy, and cash as goron gwiwa (lit. kola nuts for knees; a pre-trance gift for adepts) and says to them ‘Bismilla’ (Please begin), there can be no doubt that the presence of spirits at the performance is requested. After the caller places the tray in front of the musicians and then retires, interested mediums come over one by one to accept a portion of the gift. By accepting a part of the goron gwiwa a medium obligates himself to participation in trance demonstration. With this gift the atmosphere of the performance is transformed from ‘play’ to the serious work of accommodating the arrival of spirits.

The participating trancers (who have accepted the ‘gifts for their knees’) organize themselves immediately in front of the musicians and the process of inducing their altered states of consciousness begins. The song described as appropriate is that for Magajiyar Jangare, and shortly after it starts all the devotees should have entered the first phase of possession-trance, each ridden by a different spirit. In exceptional cases other music or special procedures are necessary to induce the trance of inexperienced or ‘difficult’ mediums, but everything possible is done to avoid this.

A few general comments about the observed behaviour of possessed mediums can be made at this point. Hausa possession-trance is reported to occur at two levels, mediums describing the first as the arrival of the spirit and the second as its actual ride. As their spirits arrive many mediums show signs of catalepsy or epileptoid seizure. Perspiring profusely, their bodies seemingly racked with convulsions, they cough or vomit and froth at the mouth and nose. Very quickly their trance states are stabilized, and they begin to gesture or move in a manner consistent with the character of the spirits on their necks. When a spirit is said to be in control of his horse’s behaviour his medium is appropriately attired either at the trance-induction site or, if the materials are elaborate or numerous, at one side of the site or in a changing room close by. Consistent with their image of themselves as horses, possessed mediums must be backed by their ‘grooms’ through narrow passageways or door openings to confined places (e.g. changing rooms).

When the horse returns to the performance area it is ready first to greet (and be greeted by) the musicians and important guests and then to dance or otherwise demonstrate the spirit’s ride. Some spirits treat their mounts roughly, causing them to beat their bodies, throw themselves to the ground, or crash violently through the spectators. Others ride quietly, and when not dancing their horses roam around as though in a somnambulistic state.

If a spirit wishes to leave it obtains the attention of the musicians by thanking them for their music and seats its mount on the ground. The musicians bid it farewell and then play a short, fast piece for it. Its medium sneezes or otherwise returns to himself: the divine horseman has departed. When all the spirits have gone and Nakada’s song is played, the ceremony is over. All that remains is the sharing out of the gifts and money collected during the event (see above).

It will be seen that an important part of periodic possession-trance cermonies is related to its context as a gift-giving event. Without the necessity to exchange gifts or create social obligations a cult performance is totally artificial and lacks emotive power. ‘Staged’ performances on a fee basis are an example of this. The participants regard them as nothing more than entertainment, a mere sketch of the social ceremony. There is no separation between guests and hosts which the event can mediate. Musicians and praise-singers consider it inappropriate to announce gifts in any detail, since there is no ‘other side’ expected to match the giver’s generosity.

Possession-trance ceremonies held for weddings, namings, or for cult purposes have an entirely different tone. Social values are reinforced, and, as was discussed earlier (Chapter II), gift-giving is laden with the symbolism of individual and group interaction. Many gifts presented at a cult performance imply a three-sided structure. The givers appear to compete with each other in demonstration of generosity, a central Hausa value. But givers who are divided into groups of guests and hosts do not present their gifts to each other; they present their generosity, and it is generosity which demands reciprocation. Such gifts are given to musicians who share them with event participants. A ‘restricted’ exchange system exists between guests and hosts who consider themselves equals, but between any one of them and the musicians an asymmetrical system is revealed. The musicians are permitted to reciprocate gifts only with their service as witnesses and their acceptance of a low status. Thus, with each gift the donor proclaims both his position in his group and his group’s position with respect to his gift-giving opponents (equals) and musicians (inferiors).

Musicians are well aware of the significance attached to gift-giving. Indeed, they use it to their advantage in the belief that low social status need not be translated into low economic status. Part of their strategy is to attempt to drive a wedge between hosts and guests, hoping to stimulate their respective gift-giving impulses with their demand for social equality. For example when a guest presents a gift to a musician at a cult performance the music stops and spectators are urged to hear a praise-shouter’s public announcement of it. The gift as well as the identity of the giver are described in most elaborate detail, and the gift’s positive attributes are maximized to the fullest extent (see above, Chapter III). With the presentation publicly witnessed it is not the musicians who feel the pressure to reciprocate, but the hosts who may be observed in discomfort.

As has been noted, many gifts are given by cult sympathizers from either side of the spectators in order to reaffirm a pact with a spirit. In this respect they are similar to individual commitments in alms-giving. Although alms descend in the social hierarchy in so far as it is ‘beggars’ or musicians (alms-receiving specialists) who witness and receive them, they are given as tribute to the Almighty or, for those affiliated with the bori cult, to spirits. As implied in an earlier discussion of exchange (see above, p. 32), social stratification is a necessary element in alms-giving since a recipient of alms is not expected to reciprocate in the future, but to validate the gift by acknowledging the purpose for which it was given. That it is inappropriate for them to reciprocate is translated into social inequality in that recipients of alms are thereby placed in a depressed social position in respect to givers of alms.

Since gifts to spirits represent an individual commitment for givers, generosity is not really involved and no competition exists. Whether musicians and praise-shouters are aware of the social implications of gifts for spirits may be open to debate, but their behaviour in such instances is striking. Such gifts are received quietly and without any interruption of event process. They are set aside in piles according to the names of the spirits for whom they were given, with the intention of dividing them among the ‘poor’, i.e. musicians and participating mediums (see p. 29).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual170,"Divination Rite, Agba","Agba — Divination Rites

Agba rites are used in divining the source of an affliction, thieves, the outcome of duels, head-hunting and ordeals. There are two forms: (1) the spanning of a stick, and (2) the balancing of an egg, bean, or other spheroidal object on a knife blade. In the former, the stick is believed, when the right name or class of deities or outcome is mentioned, to grow longer so that the priest cannot span it; in the latter (which is called buyun), the egg stands on the knife edge. The former is the more popular in Kiangan, the latter in Ligauwe and regions north. There is a considerable difference in the invocation, but at least the Messengers and the Hawat Deities must be invoked.

The agba is used mostly in cases of sickness. It is highly important to the Ifugao to be able to determine which of his more than forty classes of deities has caused an affliction, for invoking and sacrificing to all of them would usually cost beyond his means.

The prayers differ considerably in different regions. The following is the prayer used in Ligauwe in the buyun rite:

Hold ye this stone of the chicken [egg]. It is not about a duel, nor head-hunting nor about lost property, but about the sickness of [name] that I am consulting thee, Stone of the Chicken. Name of the afflictors? Are they the Ancestors? If thou seest so, Stone of the Chicken, then bite the iron. [The priest tries to balance the egg—if it topples off, he continues]: Name of the Afflictors—the Matungulan? If thou seest so, Stone of the Chicken, then bite the iron....

The invocation continues in this strain until, when the afflicting class of deities is named, the egg stands on the knife-edge.

The divination of lost or stolen property and of crime is in the hands of specialists who command rather high fees—P2 to P10, with P5 as an ordinary charge. The younger generation calls them “Ifugao detectives.” These men are superb readers of human nature. They are greatly feared, since they are believed to possess rites by which they can cause the death of thieves who do not return the stolen property.

The following account from my journal is interesting in this connection and as giving a peep into the mind of an acculturated “educated” Ifugao.

June 5, 1937. Had a great treat in the shape of a visit of one of my first Ifugao pupils who came yesterday and stayed overnight with me. When I went to Kungan in 1908, Antonio Gembatan was in the highest class there—third or fourth grade—about twelve years old. He is now past forty, is sanitary inspector for Burnay municipality and had come to Bitu on a round of “inspection” and of treating patients who applied to him. Has been sanitary inspector ever since he finished a course of simple medicine in Baguio and Manila about 1920. I recognized him as soon as I saw him and we had a long talk. He is a liberal—a bit disappointed in life in the respect that he has not apparently done so well in life as some of his classmates like Pokin Codamon, former member of the Assembly, or Alberto Gimpatan, General Manager of Public Works for the Sub-province. He talked with less reserve than Ifugaos usually do. Among other things, he recounted the following experience: In 1920, when he was about twenty-four years old, being then stationed in Kiangan, he went on an inspection trip to Amduntug. Meeting a patrol of constabulary soldiers, he asked one of them, a kinsman, to lend him his hat, as the sun was very hot. At Amduntug he found a drinking party in connection with the celebration of a hingot (third marriage ritual). Being somewhat drunk, he did not remember to put the hat on when he left—didn’t remember it till he reached Palao on the way home (about 7 km. from Amduntug). He sent a policeman to get it, but the policeman reported that his host of the drinking party denied all knowledge of any hat left behind. He then returned to look for it himself. The host again denied having seen any such hat.

He decided then to employ an “Ifugao detective” and consulted Dulnuwan of Amduntug. D. demanded a fee of P5. Antonio thought this too high and replied that he hadn’t that amount with him. D. said the rite might be performed later on as he (D.) had to come to Kiangan after two or three days in connection with another case.

Dulnuwan came to Kiangan and attended first to a lost money case. A soldier had turned his month’s pay over to his wife Rita, who claimed a little later that she had lost the money. D. put a round buligan bean on a razor blade and addressed the bean: “Was the money stolen? If the money was stolen, Buligan Bean, then stand thou upon this blade.” The bean fell. “Not stolen! Then if lost by Rita by falling down somewhere, stand thou on the blade!” The bean stood. D. said he would carry the divination no further at present, as his head ached. 

Next morning Rita went below the house to feed the chickens and exclaimed, “Oh! Here is our money. I found it in this chicken coop!”

Dulnuwan next took up Antonio’s case. “If hat lost on the Amduntug side, stand!” The bean stood. “If hat fell off on road to Kiangan, stand!” It did not stand. “If hat was left at the house of the host, stand!” It stood. Then the “detective” refused to carry the case any further, on the ground that the two pesos Antonio had agreed to pay him was not enough. “Probably,” said Antonio, “he wanted to protect the host, a co-villager of his.”

Antonio worried continually about the lost hat. He became ill—as a result, he believed, of having had dealings with a bad lot of spirits. His disease was much like malaria, but not “amenable [he used that term] to quinine,” wherefore he concluded it must be derived from a supernatural source. He dreamed continually in his sleep. He always at this period of his life slept in the dormitory for the unmarried (being a bachelor), and in order to get rid of his dreams he went to a different dormitory almost every night. He frequently dreamed that “a beautiful lady” brought him a bunch of bananas, or something of the kind. Then he’d awaken and find no bananas. He brooded and brooded about the hat. When he would wake up, that would be the first thing he’d think about. One night he dreamed that he was being pursued by a long-legged giant, that he fled into a house and that the giant struck it with his staff. Just then his companion woke him up and said, “What was that that hit our house?”

Antonio then told his dream and the two concluded that the long-legged giant of the dream was a makalun (messenger deity) who had come to warn Antonio and that it was time for him to do something about his “malaria.” So Antonio went to Tabunu, a priest, next morning, and Tabunu used the agba stick and ascertained that the illness was due to the witchcraft of an enemy—the host who had hidden and kept the hat, as Antonio believes—and that it was necessary to perform the hagaho (sorcery) rite. Antonio followed this advice and recovery from his illness was immediate. The priest prayed, of course, that the enemy’s witchcraft should return against that enemy’s own body.

A week later, word reached Kiangan that the Amduntug host had died suddenly and that the hat had been found under circumstances indicating that the host had sold it!",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual171,Hunting Ritual,"Hunting Rites

Probably half of the Ifugao’s ritual myths begin with a hunting expedition, and this fact would seem to indicate that hunting played a great part in the life of the people at the time the religion was in its heyday of growth. The way in which the hunt begins, as set forth in the myths, is nearly always the same: an Ifugao’s dogs show that they are ready to hunt by chasing domestic pigs and chickens and seizing them with their mouths. Thereupon, being urged by his father or by neighbors irritated at the dogs’ forays on their property, the Ifugao makes up his mind to cast off sloth for a while and to go hunting. He catches his dogs or their leader, and ties them up to a post of his house by means of a tie passed through a bamboo to protect it from the dog’s biting it in two and freeing himself. Next he calls a brother or a neighbor to go hunting with him, usually the former.

Rites preceding the hunt: The first ritual is the Pahang di Amaiyu. One or two chickens are provided for sacrifice—if only one, it will be sacrificed to the Alabat deities (Class 22), if two, the Gods of Reproduction are given the other. The program of the rituals is as follows:

1. Invocation, to the Ancestors.

2. Invocation to the Gods of Reproduction: If there be no chicken to offer these deities, the charge to them will begin, “Ye are exhorted....”; if there be a sacrifice, it begins:

Ye are offered a chicken in order that ye of the Downstream Region [or of the Upstream Region] make fast your carrying blanket 4 and carry the children [the hunters] and the dogs. It is correct that they walk on the edges of the mountain but the harmful things will be bent harmless and even the mouths of snakes, so that the children pass by them unscathed and also the dogs. It is correct that these scare up the boar and that the children will throw their spears and that its whole body be heart and that it die where it stands, so that the hunting of the children will be continually heard of, and it is good that they abound in life, that the pigs and chickens abound in life and the rice increase and that the enemies and evil spirits be turned aside from them.

3. Invocation to the Alabat (hunting deities): A chicken is being sacrificed to you so that ye help the children who follow the mountains, but it is correct that the dogs speak but pass scatheless and the harmful things bend over and even the mouths of snakes, and the bodies of the children be smooth and that the edges of the grasses will be harmless and also the snags and sharp sticks. So that they spear what is omened [i.e., the quarry foretold by the omens], correct that it die where it stands and that the hunting of the children will be heard and heard about, and do what ye do in this fashion, ye deities, and it will be well.

The chicken’s throat is cut, while the names of those to whom it is sacrificed are being repeated. The bile omen is observed: the nihumwit is the good one, especially if it have a greenish color. If naboye or nakupa, imakid, namatauwil or niaba, they postpone the hunt and wait several days before repeating the rituals.

A ceremonial idleness of one day follows these rites. If, during this day a limb of a tree is seen to fall, or if a hawk catches a chicken, or any other unusual event, such as a snake’s entering the house, is observed, then the hunt is off.

On the morrow, the hunters go carrying a spear to a hill to consult the omens of the bird. If the omen be rapid, that is good. When the bird “talks,” if the omen be good, they “accept”—that is, they ejaculate: “So be it with the lives of us who go hunting so that we jerk in two the navel string of the quarry, the boar of the mountains.” If the bird’s “talk” be “harsh” or slow and cautious, they return home and the hunt is postponed. If the bird’s talk be “rapid” (a good omen in this case), they go a second time and hope to hear “rapid” talk again. On the third day, however, they hope to hear “harsh” talk from the bird, for that day’s omen relates to the quarry. The bird is then said to be “crying away” the quarry’s life. Many days may be required to get the right omens so that they can start on the hunt.

With omens finally satisfactory, the hunters set forth with their dogs. They go to the edge of the forest and tie up the dogs. Then they gather dry sticks, strike fire (with flint and steel in these days, but the name applied to the apparatus meant originally the making of fire by friction) and burn the sticks. In the myths they are represented as having a nap until the fire burns to coals. Then they go to a neighboring stream and bring back some water in a leaf and quench the coals, saying:

Be quenched the mouths of the snakes, the snags, the mouths of the wild boar and the centipedes, but be not quenched the mouths of the dogs nor be we brothers quenched, so that we pass scatheless. And be far away the evil spirits of the Downstream Region and of the Upstream Region. And afterwards bring we back the “omened” here to our village of — and be heard and heard about the hunting of the children, so that the paths of the wild boars be skinned clean. Quench, but quench not the abundance of our vitality nor the vitality of the pigs and chickens and the turning aside of the enemies and evil spirits.

The hunt: As a rule, the hunters start for the hills where this rite is to be performed at a little before midforenoon. An hour or two will have been devoted to the performance of the rite and to sleeping while the fire burns down.

Hunting, as the rite intimates, is a dangerous business. Besides the dangers mentioned in the prayers, namely, the snags, snakes and centipedes, there are the dangers of falling over a precipice and of being speared by mistake. The latter is not a very infrequent occurrence. Another danger is that of being impaled by a deadly speartrap set by somebody else or of falling into a pit made to catch game.

Aside from its dangers, the exertions and discomforts of hunting are great. The mountains are among the steepest in the world. Toothed plant blades saw the skin. Many plants, especially the ubiquitous runos, are covered with stinging hairs. Hunters usually prepare beforehand a small jar of rice wine called hô-ôd, with which to refresh themselves on their return.

Usually the hunters number only two to four, and the dogs one to four. But, according to hunting custom, anybody, anywhere, who hears the baying of the dogs and the cries of the hunters, may “come out” with his spear and spear the game if opportunity presents. Now if one of these “comers-out” should do this, he will not touch the carcass until the originators of the hunt come up. The rules of the division are pretty uniform throughout Ifugao and probably the whole mountain region; they are almost exactly the same as among the Kalingas (see The Kalingas, p. 86). The Ifugao rules set forth below are taken from Atipulo:

1. If a hunter shall have been wounded by the quarry, he always receives a hind quarter and a part of the sirloin, no matter how many the hunters may be.

2. The spearer’s portion is called the tinangbag and he himself is called the mananglag. The portion consists of a hind leg and a portion of the ribs.

3. If there were a second spearer, he receives the other side of the sirloin.

4. Anybody who “comes out” before the process of dividing the carcass is begun receives a portion. It is believed that the place spirits ( pinading) of the locality would punish violation of this rule by causing future hunts to be unsuccessful.

5. Likewise, unless the hunters be too numerous, anybody who is met on the return home, “especially women,” must be given a portion—otherwise “it will be bad for the dogs.”

6. If the game were taken by pit or speartrap, then, since the hunters number only two or three, everybody encountered on the way home must be given a share, also, on arrival, some of the co-villagers.

7. The head, belly fat ( dalum), and part of the liver are reserved for the one who initiated the hunt, the neck and part of the liver for his companions, and the lungs for the dogs. In dividing the remainder, “the one who is slow will not get any.”

8. The first catch of the season will not be shared with neighbors on the arrival home. What remains will be eaten solely by the hunter’s household. The portion received from subsequent hunts will be divided with relatives or neighbors as the hunter desires.

9. If a “comer-out” spears the game and carries it away, or takes a portion before the hunters come up, then an indemnity called h[illegible]al will be levied on him. It amounts to a pig of pikat size or ten chickens, worth P10.

Rites in the forest: Leaves are spread on the ground at the site of the kill and the game is cut up. A bit of the belly fat is placed on a back-basket and the local pinading (place spirits) are invoked:

Here is your portion. It is well that ye accompany us in the hunt to the end that the game be quickly brought down, so that ye will always have a share. Turn aside the poisonous snakes, the snags and sharp stones so that we shall live and the dogs shall live.

Dalutag: This is a rite performed on arriving home after the first kill of the season.

Invocation: To the Ancestors, the Pinading, the Gods of Reproduction, the Alabat.

Sacrifice: A piece of the belly fat, some muscle and some of the liver from the quarry are placed with some cooked rice on the hunting basket.

Prayer ( Duyun) to the Pinading: “Meat is what we are invoking you with and it is good that ye accompany us in the hunt so that the game be quickly slain, so that the quarries be killed one after another, so that our hunting become famous in these mountains, so that we pass unscathed through dangers and our dogs pass unscathed through dangers, so that we abound in life and our pigs and chickens live.”

Prayer to the alabat deities: “Do not drain the blood, do not suck the blood of us who go hunting. Let the wild pigs be the ones whose blood ye suck, whose blood ye drain, so that we spear one after another the quarries where they stand, so that our hunting become famous here in these mountains and so that there always be meat like this with which to invoke you, and here, hunting rite is what we are praying you.”

Ritual172,Rice Ritual,"Rice Ritual

The calendar of these rites that follow is based on the rites in Central Ifugao at the time that only one crop a year was raised. Since 1937 the practice of raising two crops a year has spread over a large part of Ifugao and has upset the old ritual calendar. The rites are crowded together more closely than before. There are no rites for the second crop—the Ifugao does not regard it as a serious one—although in some regions it produces more than the first crop.

The two-crop system and the high wages paid in the mines have cooperated to effect a lower standard of rice cultivation than prevailed up to the present: shallow spading, careless weeding, neglect of pests and so on.

The rice year and the ritual cycle begin with the weeding of the fields and the cleaning of the terrace walls—women’s work. Since harvest the fields will have lain idle and grown up in weeds, and the water will have become covered with floating plants. The women thrust all this vegetation into the soil where it becomes fertilizer.

LUKAT: October—first weeding of the fields.

Invocation: To the Ancestors, the Messengers, the Paybackables and the Clustered-Villages Deities. Sacrifice: a chicken.

Charge (to the Clustered-Villages Deities): Itadulan-yo taiyaban, te inukuka. 7 Hana ta adi mauka di linauwa n di page. Mauka mu higahiga n di o-onga ya hulok di bananu, ta doldolyahon-da, ta ladakon-da te nalablabongan, mu humabang di kilut. Adi-kayo mangagamid, ya monlogolmon-da y mombaki ya hai namompon ya namukad, mu adi mangagamid di maliyak hi mialinduat. Hana ta monlololbong hina ta umingit, ta mahadot di loba banong, ta kataguan di miliyak.

Ye are offered a chicken because it is a “sticking under” rite. Correct that be not stuck under the soul of the rice. Be stuck under ill-disposedness and the grass of the fields, so that they (the women) trample the grass of the fields, so that they arrange the temporary dikes because the fields are grown up with fat an˜kles [fat grass], but let the muddy waters go downstream. Ye will not take  and the priests will eat what they please, as well as those who arranged the rice bundles in the granary and the reciters of myths, but do not take the crop when the season swings around. Correct that it (the field) be filled with water there, that the dikes be ruddy and that the banks hold the water, so that the crop abound in life.

PUDUNG: October—November—just before planting seed-bed. Runo stalks are stuck up and laid all around the bed, which is within a field.

Invocation: To the Ancestors, Paybackables, Clustered-Villages Deities, Gods of the Winds and Place-Spirits. Sacrifice: a chicken.

Charge: We stick up runo stalks for the life of what will be planted, so that it “arrive” and fruit, so that it sweat. Be the field continually flooded, so that the crop abound in life with the swing of the seasons, and the rat-kind and mouse-kind and the rice-birds and duyadui birds and the destroyers [pests and diseases] be ashamed, and it arrive and be fruited.

LOKA: Same time as preceding, when the seed rice is taken from the granary. Same sacrifice.

Invocation: Same as preceding.

Charge (to the Paybackables): Ye are offered a chicken, because it is seed-laying time. We will lay the seed-rice in the watered place, but increase of tillers and spread of the seeds [is what we pray for] so that it look upward at the increasing moon, so that it be on time, so that the rat-kind and the mouse-kind and the duyadui birds be elsewhere, so that it “arrive and fruit and bend over.”

UGWID: October—November—Just before men begin spading the fields.

Invocation: To the Ancestors, Paybackables, Gods of Reproduction, Clustered-Villages, Field-Builders and Place-Spirits. Sacrifice: a chicken.

Charge (to the Place-Spirits): Ye are offered a chicken so that ye counsel your descendants not to hinder the spade, not to scratch out stones from the first tier of the terrace, not to flap (like a duck or chicken) the rice we shall sow. Correct that that it be on time, that they go around and around and that the crop ripen, because ye have been offered a chicken, ye place-spirits.

There is a special rite for the local place-spirits called toong, made by all who join a mutual-help gang ( bokla):

A chicken is sacrificed unto you place-spirits, but advise your descendants not to undermine the stone-walls (of the terraces) and not to cause spades to strike the shoulders, so that ye help so that the work be quickly done and be easy to do in the field, so that the crop abound in life and the rats and rice-birds go away, and it arrives and has fruited, so that it bends over, and we take the crop so that there will be where-withal for the making of wine to which ye are always invited. Because a feast other than for the cure of sickness is what ye are being prayed. 

BOLNAT: November—December—When seedlings taken from seed-bed.

Invocation: To Ancestors, Paybackables, Gods of Reproduction. Sacrifice: A chicken.

Prayer (to Ancestors): We take up the seedlings from the surrounded-by-a-dike-within-the-field [that is, the seedbed] but increase them so that there be a throwing away of surplus seedlings on every dike, every terrace and in the uncultivated places, because bolnat is what ye are being prayed.

KULPE: December—January—Immediately after transplanting rice.

Invocation: To Ancestors, Paybackables, Clustered-Villages, Granary Idols, Field-Makers, Wind Gods, Place-Spirits, Gods of Reproduction. Sacrifice: A pig and chickens.

Charge (to the Paybackables): A pig is sacrificed for you so that ye visit every terrace so that ye cause feathers to be put forth in the rows [of seedlings] in the fields, but putting out leaves and changing of leaves with new ones [is enjoined]. It (the rice) shakes off worms and the leaf curler and the rats and the rice-birds and the mouse-rat kind are ashamed and it grows on time and “arrives” and fruits so that it bends its heads over, because transplanting ( winanawan) rites are what ye are being prayed.

HAGOPHOP: February—March—Just before the women weed the crops.

Invocation: To the Ancestors, the Messengers, the Paybackables. Sacrifice: A chicken.

PAAD: April—May—Performed in Kiangan just before the terrace banks and dikes are weeded so as to prevent the rice from wilting, shrivelling and dying in sympathy with the uprooted weeds.

Performed in Central Ifugao when the terraces planted with early varieties of rice are about ready to be harvested. These terraces will provide rice for the harvesters of the other terraces. But the nature of the invocation shows that the rite has been transferred from some such function as it has in Kiangan, for the injunction has little to do with harvesting. Paad means to cut weeds or grass.

Invocation: Ancestors, Messengers, Paybackables, Bulol, Clustered-Villages Deities, Wind Gods, Field-Makers, Place-Spirits. Sacrifice: Pig(s) and chickens.

Charge (to the Paybackables): Ye are invoked and a chicken is sacrificed for you because the paad rite is being performed, so that the souls of rice and pigs and chickens be not cut down. But be cut down the mouths of the mice and large rats and the mouths of the rice-birds, so that they go away into the forest, so that the runo shoots be what they eat. And it (the crop) will hurry and draw out its heads and bend over and turn white like split wood, and crackle like a burning mountain-side, and rustle like falling limbs in the Downstream Region. They will bring in the gathered rattan before the grains are yet formed. And it hurries and ripens, and the children reach for it (harvest it), and we will prepare rice wine so that there be something to ceremonialize you with, because paad is what ye have been prayed.

HANGLAG (frying): May—June—First eating of new rice.

Invocation: To the Ancestors who “tied up” in times past (originators of the rite), Messengers, Paybackables, Gods of Reproduction, the Convincers and the Tied-Ups. Sacrifice: chickens.

The principal rite is called binudbud, “tied-up.” It is repeated several times during the year. Its purpose is to “tie up” the new rice and “tie up” the stomachs of the people so that but a little will satisfy hunger. At the same time, the Ifugao “ties up” spears, fenceposts and knives so that these will not be used to inflict wounds—that is, he provides for maintenance of peace during harvest when many workers from several regions will meet together.

Three men are sent to gather the more mature heads about a week before harvest. The grains are stripped from the straw, but are not threshed—they are roasted in an iron skillet in their chaff. The priests eat some of this—they eat only a little, and this eating but a little sets a “pattern” for the field workers, guests and family in eating the new crop throughout the year.

Charge (to the Ancestors): Ye ancestors of ours are invoked to exhort the Clustered-Villages Gods and those who are in the Sky-World, the Underworld, the Downstream Region and the Upstream Region and the Gods of Reproduction because this is a leaf-sheath fabric rite which is a tying-up and we wrap the rice in a leaf-sheath fabric, and let it hasten and turn pink and bend over so that we may hurry to prepare something for you to drink. And we are wrapping [symbolic objects] in a leaf-sheath fabric and are tying up the cooked rice and it is the same as ye leaf-sheathed long ago, so that the rice will fill up the space whence taken and increase and become like sands in the kulbung baskets and will become rough to eat under the basket lids so that it increase and become like black sand and be quiet in their stomachs and be as if put into a bamboo joint, as if it were in a nose flute, and the vapors pass straight through so that it will be the object of the twilighting of the Red Sun of the Downstream Region and of the Upstream Region, because leaf-sheath fabric which is a tying-up rite is what is being prayed you.

UPIT RITE: After the deities have been invoked, a priest takes a bit of the leaf-sheath material and places on it some of the roasted rice grains, a piece of liya leaf, some ends of twigs of the tikom tree and a tiny, whittled-out, wooden knife. He wraps the sheath over them, raises the bundle above his head and ties it with kamalutilit vine, saying:

Ye are wrapped, sheath and rice and liya and tikom. Imitate that which Ancestor Linglingon wrapped, and those wrapped by Ancestors Bantulin, Mamingit, Dumapi, Buyukan and Bultik at Dugung. For as ye ancestors did, before, so are we doing now, so that the stomachs of the children will be as if wrapped up and tied and will be quiet as if twilighted in the Red Light of the Downstream Region and the Upstream Region.

The priest then puts the bundle into a bamboo tube and, laying the tube near one of the house studs behind the thin stones ( duklig) of the rear of the fireplace—stones whose purpose is to protect the walls from fire—he prays very softly to the rice inside:

Thou art placed near the bagat stud and hast been placed in a tube so as to put thee away behind the duklig stones. And be the stomachs of the children imitators, so that they will be as if inside bamboo tubes, as if inside a nose flute, as if laid against a house stud, and so that the vapors will pass straight through, and be thou quiet and twilighted by the Red Light of the Downstream Region and of the Upstream Region and turned into food, but nourish the hired-help and the mutual-help workers, and it is correct that please thou to increase also so that thou meet [sc. last until] our rice of the seasonal swing [next crop]. This is the reason I have put you in a bamboo, Rice and Wrapping and Liya and Tikom.

POKOL: May—June—Only by the rich on the night before harvest.

Invocation: To practically all classes of the deities except some of the exclusively pathogenic ones. Sacrifices: one or more fat pigs, several chickens.

This is one of the few agricultural rites to be performed at the house instead of at the granary. It partakes of the nature of a general welfare feast ( honga). It lasts all night and has the following specific features: (1) the alim, a ballad exclusively the privilege of those who have performed prestige feasts and thereby attained the rank of kadnagyan, is chanted; this requires several hours; (2) there are shouted invocations and a chant to the bakaiyauwon in the early hours of the morning.

Like the alim, these chants appear, judging from their language, to have come up from the extreme southern part of Ifugaoland. I present only two stanzas out of many, for the rest are all much like these and as meaningless. Two priests stand side by side just below the doorway of the house, both clasping a bundle of rice, which they swing. The chant is called danyu.

Invocation: Ye Bakaiyauwon, hi Wantiah, hi Impango [“Like Amber-Colored Beads”?], hi Inggahnu, hi Tumalao [“Who Becomes a Star”], hi Ananaiyo [“Cicada”], hi Montikbu, hi Imbabui [“Like a Pig”], hi Imbalituka:

Chant:
Heaven-dweller who
Came down to earth and
Went to the Downstream!
Serve as my pig for a prestige feast.
Forbade it my mother,
Dislikes, dislikes,
Spent many for her prestige feast Ulien.
Imbuba, the five-stranded,
Ten-stranded and ten-stranded,
Who were heaven-dwellers
And came down to Earth,
They went to the Downstream,
Went further downstream,
Arrived at Tinglaiyan.
They hung them up,
And I say,
“I’ll use them for a prestige feast
And become kadangyan.”
Forbade it my mother,
Dislikes much, Mother, Ulien.

There follows a shouted invocation by a priest who runs around inside the house, counterclockwise, then looks down on the two men outside who have been swinging the rice bundle and chanting, addressing them:

OOOOOOOOOOooooooooooiiiiiiii! Hark ye, hark ye, these here, acting the role of bakaiyauwon who have descended! Press us against this house because we are rich folk day by day.

When I was a young man I traveled and traveled far into the Downstream Region. I saw the baliti-ed place of the Downstream Region, which was many-branched, many-limbed and covered enough ground for a village and had fruits hanging down in clusters—the assembling place of all the bird-kind. Their eating sounded like frying fat. I saw its buttress and hacked it. It flowed sap and I returned it (the drippings) here to our village to be the souls of pigs and chickens and children—and continue the shouting, agi-i-i-yu-yu-yu-yu-yu, Whoooooooo!

The chant continues and after each two stanzas the invocation is repeated. Perhaps the rigmarole serves its function as a distinguishing mark of class all the better for the very reason that it has little or no substance. The invocation to the bakaiyauwon of the Upstream Region is:

OOOOOOOOOOooooooooooiiiiiiiiii! Hark ye, hark ye, these actors of the role of bakaiyauwon who have gone upstream! Press us against this house, because we are rich folk day by day.

When I was young I traveled far into the Upstream Region. I saw the narra tree of the Upstream Region, branched and twigged and fruited, its fruit hanging in clusters and covering a double lake, encircled, one after the other, by large fish going round and round it. I hacked the base of it and it flowed sap, unfading red sap. It dripped the souls of the pigs and chickens. I returned it (the sap) here to our village in Bitu and it serves to ensoul the pigs and chickens, and sickness is cured and the children grow rapidly—and continue the shouting—agi-i-i-i-yu-yu-yu-yu-yu, Whooooo!

When the chant is finished, all assemble in the house, where the priests are possessed by the bagol (possessing deities). The pig is then killed downstairs, its head facing the door, while above, inside the house, the priests rapidly invoke the names of the deities in the “bases” of the various classes. Then several priests squat on the floor and chant this smug ditty, the hangal:

Propped and propped by what?
Prop of what?
The husband and wife heard
Forbidding omens,
Forbidding omens of harsh talk,
Doubtful talk,
Harsh talk of the omen bird.

But here is our prop,
Here is our pillar
That many are our pigs,
Many are our pigs
And bad omens slide off us,
Slide to our kindred the Hiking folk, 
And our kindred the Benguet folk,
Who have no general-welfare feasts,
No way of hiding from evil spirits.

Propped and propped by what?
Our prop, what is it?
Our base, what is it?
The husband and wife,
When farming their fields,
Were forbidden by omens,
Forbidden by the omen bird.

But here is our prop,
Here is our base:
Our pigs are mature,
Our pigs are mature,
So that we slide on bad omens
To our kindred the Kurug folk,
Our kindred the Mongaiyan folk,
Who have no general-welfare rites,
Who have no means of protection.

The pokol rites last all night and are followed the next day by the regular harvest feast, held at the granary—one that every owner of a rice field feels compelled to give. In these rites, we present not only a few injunctions but some of the invitations and exhortations to the deities and their declarations when possessing the priests—items which we have omitted from the other rites given in this volume.

INGNGILIN: May—June—By every field owner on the day he harvests.

Invocation: Ancestors, Messengers, Paybackables, Omen-Deities, Clustered-Villages Deities, Field-Makers, Bulol, Place-Spirits, Gods of Reproduction, Wind Gods, Bakaiyauwon. Sacrifices: one or two pigs and several chickens. This ritual lasts four to seven hours, depending on the number of priests officiating.

Prayer (to the Messengers of the Skyworld): Ye Messengers who are of the Skyworld are exhorted to drink the rice wine here and to respond and convince these Skyworld-dwellers and these Feelers for the Birds. We are paying them this pig, but correct that they afflict not with hardships and indebtedness and sicknesses but that they respond by endowing with abundance of life and quick growth of children, and miraculous increase of the rice and multiplication of pigs and chickens, and the shunting aside of enemies and evil spirits. Because ye are being exhorted in a feast not motivated by sickness.

Invitation (aiyag). Come thou, Wigan of Habian, so that thou respond and convince these Paybackables who are at Habian and these Feelers for the Birds so that they come down. Because it is a feast not motivated by sickness. Come thou!

Possession (hikkop): Hiye-e-e-e-e-e-eh! [crescendo, Central Ifugao] or Tsay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay! [crescendo, Kiangan]. Has come down Wigan, of Habian ya bebe-mo! I respond and will convince those who are at Habian and the Feelers for the Omen Birds, because I am a convincer of firm determination at Habian. I partake of the rice wine and I look upon the victims because I take joy in them and ye are making a feast not motivated by sickness, ye earth-dwellers. Hiye-e-e-e-e-eh! [diminuendo] or say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay! [diminuendo].

Charge (to the Paybackables): Ye Paybackables are invoked and ye are paid back with a pig, but do not be mean and do not curse with hardships and burden of debts. And ye are exhorted to be kind so that they abound in life, so that the children make a good growth and the pigs and chickens abound in life, and the debtors pay up quickly, and [this sacrifice is also] for hurrying [payment of debts] and that the enemy and evil spirits be shunted off. Because a feast not motivated by sickness is what is being prayed you.

Invitation: Come thou, Ampual of the Skyworld, come so that ye do not curse with hardships and indebtedness. Come, for ye are being exhorted for abundance of life of the pigs and chickens. Because a feast not motivated by sickness. Come thou!

Possession: Hiye-e-e-e-e-e-e-eh! Has come down Ampual of the farther side of the Skyworld ya bebe-mo! I drink of the rice wine and I behold the pig because that is what I delight in. I will multiply your pigs and chickens and I will miraculously increase the rice because ye are making a feast not motivated by sickness ya bebe-mo! Hiye-e-e-e-e-e-eh!

Charge (to the Clustered-Villages Deities): Ye are invoked, Clustered-Villages Deities of the Downstream Region, and the pig is being oblated because we are harvesting, because we are cutting the rice with knives, the rice in the rice field, and the baby-carriers [women] are drawing to themselves the butts of rice. Be the piles of bundles increased. We keep taking the ripened [crop] under the shaded [the granary] because harvest prayers are what are being enjoined you.

Invitation: Come thou, Taiyaban, Son of Bulul at Nagadangan. Partake of the rice wine and behold the victim so that ye miraculously increase the rice and oil the clappers so as to speed the harvest. Come thou!

Possession: Hiye-e-e-e-e-e-eh! [Rubs chicken fat on the ritual clapper]. Has come upstream Taiyaban, Son of Bulul at Nagadangan ya bebe-mo. I partake of the rice wine and I behold the sacrificial victim because that is what I delight in year by year. I anoint the granary clapper because that is my nature. Correct that I encircle [he dances fantastically around the granary, stopping at each corner and extending the clapper toward the fields and shaking it] this granary and I point over the fields eh-e-e-e-e-i-i because ye are harvesting, ye earth people. [Returns to his place under the granary, still possessing the priest, and continues]: I enter this granary and I lay down my dog [the clapper] because ye are harvesting, ye earth people; ya-bebe-mo Hiye-e-e-e-e-eh!

Exhortation (tobal) by a bystander (in Kiangan and Ligauwe Districts only) while the deity is possessing the priest: Oh, that’s it, Deity! Thou drinkest the wine and beholdest the pig because thou delightest in them year by year. Oil the granary clapper and speed those who are taking the harvest! Point over the fields because that is thy nature. Make good and make good the harvest. Make the grains increase like sands. Make the rice rough in the throats of the children and the hired help. Encircle the granary and increase the rice butts, because harvest is what thou art called to. Oh, that’s it, Deity. Eh Damu!

Charge (to the Granary Idol Deities): Ye who were granary-idol-ed are invoked and a chicken is being offered you because it is harvest. And ye are oblated so that the harvesters will be oblated and so that ye sit side by side with the priests. And we keep taking the rice in the fields, but [we pray for] its being entered into the shaded place [granary], and it increases as if it were alive as in its beginning, because harvest is what is being prayed you, ye granary-idol deities.

Charge (to the Gods of Reproduction): Ye Gods of Reproduction who are in the Downstream Region are invoked, and a chicken is offered you, and it is a feast not motivated by sickness. And tighten ye the baby-slings so that ye carry the makers of this feast not motivated by sickness, so that they abound in life and their pigs and chickens abound in life, and the children grow rapidly and their rice increase miraculously, and their credits be collected quickly. Because it is a feast not motivated by sickness.

When the worship of the ancestors and deities has been completed, the victims are killed. The pigs are held over the fire in order to burn off the hair, but before being cut up for cooking, certain interesting minor rites are performed in connection with the carcasses.

Quenching the Pig (hobhob di babui): The priest throws a coconut shell of water on the carcass and addresses the pig:

Thou art quenched, Pig, here, but be not quenched the souls of the pigs, the rice and the chickens. Be quenched instead our enemies, and sorcery and evil spirits. This is our quenching in thy mouth, Pig, here.

Waga (Kiangan); Uluhan (C.I.): The essence of these two differently named rites in Kiangan and Central Ifugao is the same, but there is a little difference in the action and in the words spoken. The rite is a little more comprehensive in Kiangan, so I present the version of that place. A wreath consisting of a wisp of rice, the wiwik stick with which the pig was stabbed to death, and a little bunch of hagaga grass (which covers the fields thickly during the time they lie idle) are placed on the carcass, and the priest addresses them:

Thou art enwreathed, Pig, because thou art a pig that wast offered in a welfare rite for the harvest. And go ye all, Pig, Stabbing Stick, Rice and Hagaga Grass—ascend ye into the Skyworld. Arrive unto the village of the Lidum’s at Agtap.

Be thou not dumb or stupid, Pig, but speak up and know what to say. Tell the deities, “I was not killed by a fall, I was not trapped or speared; I am a pig that was sacrified by A— and a— [names of the husband and wife who are giving the feast]. Exhort the deities there in the Skyworld to increase the rice so that its grains become like the sands and swell up (in cooking) and be rough in the throats of the children and hired help and so that its bundles increase as if it were alive as it was before (the harvest).

Do not be lazy, Pig, and do not be coaxed from thy way. Descend to the Underworld and arrive at the village of Bahiwag, Yogyog, Tinukud and the Deities of the Underworld. Do not be stupid... but tell them, “I was not killed by a fall, I was not,... etc.

Do not be lazy, Pig, and be not coaxed from the way. Go Upstream to the village of the Wigan’s of the Upstream Region. Do not be stupid, do not be dumb....

Do not be lazy, Pig.... Go downstream to....

Do not be lazy, Pig, and do not be coaxed from thy way. Return here to our village of Pindungan to be the pig of the children. And shalt look down into thy trough every day at the house of A— and a—, and they shall feed thee so that thou grow fast, grow every day, every month. This is my way of bringing thee back, Pig.

Thou, Rice, here! Multiply like sands....

Thou, Stabbing Stick! Stab not the souls of the pigs, the chickens and the children. Stab thou Famine and Sorceries and Hardships and Sickness.

Thou, Hagaga Grass. Hagaga (multiply) the souls of the pigs, the chickens and the children. Do not hagaga the coming upstream of the Westcomers and the Pests of the Downstream Region, Famine, Curses, the Blasting Word and Sorceries, for that is what is correct.

Plucking the Hair (Badut): Hair is pulled from the carcass, from near the wound made by the stabbing stick, from the eyelids, from the foreleg and from the jowl.

Thou art plucked, but be not plucked the souls of the pigs and chickens and rice. Be plucked instead sorceries and evil spirits, and Famine and Hardships. That is how I pluck thee, Pig, here.

The “Flockers:” The priest holds a bolo on the pig’s head and addresses the maki-ulu (head-flockers):

Invitation ( aiyag): Come thou, Kumunut of Amuging! Arrive and lick the raw meat. Come!

Possession: Hiye-e-e-e-e-eh! Has arrived, Kumunut of Amuging. I lick the raw meat because such is my custom year by year on thy earth; ya bebe-mo. Returns now Kumunut of Amuging. Hiye-e-e-e-eh!

In like manner the knee-flockers and the neck-flockers are invoked and possess the priest.

After these rites, the pig is cut up and put on to cook. The feet and tail are always given to children, who roast them individually in the coals. When the meat is cooked, that is, when it may be assumed to have been heated clear through, which is all the Ifugao’s cooking of meat amounts to, part of it is cut into small pieces. The workers (all women) are called in from the fields and each is given a piece which she carries to a basket of cooked rice; she squats with others around the latter and eats. Another part of the meat—and that the choicest and in an inordinate proportion—is placed on baskets for the priests and their assistants.

Possession by the Ancestors: This rite in most feasts precedes possession by the deities, but in the harvest feast and in funeral rites it has a special, extended and intimate character and is postponed till almost the end of the feast. The ancestors hold conversations (through a possessed priest, of course) with their living descendants and often voice dissatisfactions and complaints.

Every Ifugao has ancestors from distant regions. There are two great dialects of the Ifugao language, the Aiyangan-Mayaoyao and the Ifugao proper, and they differ greatly in phonetics, not nearly so much in lexicon. The Ifugaos cite it as a proof of the genuineness of possession that Aiyangan ancestors still speak with their own pronunciation and dialect when they possess Ifugao priests. And they relate the following instance that occurred in Nahalantukan, Bitu Region, a few years ago. A priest who was said never to have had any acquaintance with the Aiyangan dialect, on being possessed by an ancestor, was startled to find words of that language issuing from his mouth. It was much, I suppose, as if an American from the Middle West suddenly found himself talking Cockney at a seance of spiritualists. At any rate I shall assume so in reporting the dialogue:

Aiyangan ancestor: “Unh, unh, unh! Bloody shyme’s what Hi calls hit, unh, unh!”

A Priest (startled): “What’s that? What do you want to say? Why are you sobbing?”

Aiyangan ancestor: “Hi sai hit’s a muckin’ shyme—thay daon’t give us naothink. You killed a carabao and thay go an’ tyke hit hall—thay do. ‘Give us our whack o’ the hanimal, maits,’ sez we, unh, unh, unh! Go an’ tyke hit hall, just the same, what thay do!”

A Priest: “We offered the carabao to all you ancestors—why didn’t you insist on getting your fair share?”

Aiyangan ancestor: “Drew their knives an’ shymed us, the bloody muckers! Unh, unh, unh. ‘Do Aiyangan-ites ’ave carabaos?’ sez thay. ‘Ooo ’n the bloomin ’ell hever ’eard such blarsted babble? Back to your camotes!’—that’s ’ow thay shymed us.”

A priest: “Never mind—you’re our ancestors just as much as they, and now that you’re here, it’s up to you to get your rights.”

Aiyangan ancestor: “Unh, unh, unh! Bulong mykes a prestige feast these two months gone an’ thay gives us naothink again, Gorblyme!”

A priest: “We want you Aiyangan ancestors to get a square deal and to have what you want. Is there anything we can do for you now?”

Aiyangan ancestor: “’Ow about a few quid to buy some bags of rice? Hit’s bloomin’ ’ell camotes dai hin an’ week hout!”

The assembled priests and bystanders collected and handed the sum to the possessed priest and told him: “Here, take this money and get some rice and be satisfied. Don’t call your living descendants.” After this gracious gesture, the money, of course, was returned to the “contributors.”

TULDAG: July—For the return of the “stolen” rice.

When everybody’s rice is dry and ready to be stacked in the granary, a ritual idleness of three days is declared, during which nobody may leave the village. Each household that has a granary performs the tuldag. In Kiangan the rites are attended by the making of rice cakes sweetened by sugar-cane juice, but in Central Ifugao the cakes are made for another rite, the takdog.

Invocation: Ancestors, Messengers, Paybackables, Clustered-Villages Deities, Granary Idols, Place-Spirits of the locality. Sacrifice: a pig and chickens or only chickens.

Prayer (to the Clustered-Villages Deities—the Principal Ones invoked): Ye deities the dwellers of Nagadangan, Namtogan, Humadol, Binuyuk, Dukligan and of the string of villages along the mountain side are invoked for the return of the rice stolen by the place-spirits and for the return of that stolen by the women of the poor class who were hired (to harvest), and take ye heed to gather up and bring the unripe heads taken by the people of Nunbalabag, Daiyakut, Nun-gauwa and Duyugon and include them in the rice of [name]. Bring ye it and add it to the stacked rice that we are recovering, so that it be like heart wood, like amugauwan wood, so that it increase as if it were alive as before, so that this household acquire and acquire pigs and chickens and shrouds. Because recovery rite is what is being enjoined you.

POMPON: Immediately after the tuldag rites (or, in Kiangan, on the last day of the ritual idleness) the rice is stacked in the granaries without further ritual. The granary is decorated with sprays of hagaga grass and leaves from the hanganga tree. The latter has ten leaflets emerging in a circle from a single stem—hence probably its connection with miraculous increase. The one who does the stacking of the rice must be a man whose fields supply him with enough rice to last his household the year around, for it is thought there is a magical sympathy between the rice and its stacker. The rice-stacker must observe continence until after the takdog rites, and may not bathe because loss of anything from his body at this time would entail loss of some of the rice.

TAKDOG: August.

Whereas the foregoing rite is performed individually by all the households of a region that have granaries, the takdog is performed communally by the whole region at the house of the first planter, the montonak. Certain fields in each region, it should be explained, are by custom planted first, and the owner of those fields, the montonak, determines for the whole valley the time of spading, repairing the dikes and planting.

In Central Ifugao, the takdog rite is preceded by a ceremonial idleness of three days. On the morning of the appointed day several atag mats are spread in a shady place in the village of the montonak, and the granary idols from all the granaries of the village are placed on them, together with the ritual chests (on top of which are piled clusters of betels) and any number of wine bowls. The granary idols are doused with rice wine and their faces are smeared with rice cakes, the making of which is a feature of the preparations.

This rite marks the ritual termination of the harvest and of the rice year.

Invocation: Ancestors, Messengers, Paybackables, Clustered-Villages Deities, Granary Idols, Gods of Reproduction, and Place-Spirits of the locality. Sacrifice: pigs and chickens.

One of the first rites of the ritual is the consultation of a cock as oracle in order to determine whether the annual ritual may be terminated and the taboos connected with the harvest removed.

Consultation of the Cock ( Puyu): Thou art consulted as oracle, Cock, Little Chicken, here, Young Rooster, here. Thou wast dropped by Lidum and fellst to Yogyog of the Underworld. Wast cast back to the center at Kiangan, where thou wast bred by Tadona. Thou multipliedst there and wast scattered throughout the villages. Hast come home to our village of—, where thou scratchest in the chinks of our paving stones and amid the rooted bases of our houseposts.

Be not ignorant in the matter about which I am consulting thee, Chicken, here. It is a takdog rite, namely, the luwa of these Bitu and Anao people, here. It is not about a duel or a slave-selling trip, it is not a sorcery rite—it is about the abundance of life of the takdog-makers. So if thou perceivest that we will be afflicted with a time of much death during the kiwang, and will suffer deaths, or that we will be speared during the year, then turn thou and peck me so that we may change our intentions.

But if it be well, so that we Anao people and Bitu people will abound in life and the children will grow rapidly, and there will intervene a healthy period and the rice will miraculously increase, and the fruit trees planted on mountains and in the fields will be loaded down—if thou seest that hardships will cease and that the wealthiness of these Bitu and Anao people will be heard about and heard about, then still thy body, Chicken, here, because a takdog rite, namely luwa, of the people of Bitu and Anao is what I am consulting thee about, Chicken, here.

Charge (to the Paybackables): Ye are invoked, deities of the Skyworld, and a chicken is offered you because it is the luwa rite of the takdog. And we are performing luwa and takdog for our rice harvest that we have accomplished and it is for the miraculous increase and for the rice to become like amugaowan. And correct that when these Bitu and Anao people clear away the jungles, the roots in their clearings shall swell and that the tuber plants in the gardened places between the rice fields shall swell, and that the “knives” on the dikes fruit and all the tuber plants. And fruit also the fruit trees, serve they for the rapid growth of the children. That is good and be the rice of the Anao and Bitu people here heard about and heard about, so that it serve as an exchange for dry-field crops. Because luwa rite of the takdog is what is being prayed you.

Fanning Rite: (The priest swings one or two of the sacrified chickens toward granaries and fields): Thou art fanned, Rice of Ours and Rice of these Anao and Bitu people here, but do not cause dreams in the middle of the night or in daytime. And fill up, so as to heartwood and become like amugaowan. And from thee be turned aside the Famine of the Downstream Region and of the Upstream so that thou unite with the harvest to come.

Thou art fanned Hagaga Grass which is haguyupyup, but hagaga [increase] the souls of the rice and chickens. Hagaga not thou famine and them thàt have gnawing lips and double hands, so that he return to his house and say he has already eaten (when invited), for I have fanned thee, Hagaga.

Thou art fanned, Ritual Chest and Basket for Betels, but do not turn white, do not have holes in thee. Become black there so that the Deities of the Skyworld and of the Underworld and those who are at Nagadangan, Binuyuk and Namtogan arrive unto thee. Be filled with hard betel nuts, hard coconut shell. But [we enjoin] for the crops, so that they come in the swing of the seasons, because thou hast been fanned with a grown chicken, Ritual Chest, Buga Stones and Coconut Shell.

KAHIU: August—For removing food prohibitions.

This rite is made by the householders individually right after the takdog. There is a ritual sweeping of the house.

Invocation: Ancestors, Messengers, Paybackables, Clustered-Villages Deities—only the “base” of each. Sacrifice: dried pigs’ jowls.

Prayer: Ye are invoked, deities ( bagol) of ours who are in the Downstream, the Skyworld, the Underworld and the Upstream, for it is a sweeping rite, and we sweep out the trash, but be not swept away, alas! the souls of the rice—the pigs and the chickens nor the toys of the children. Be swept away famine and evil spirits, because it is kahiu rite and we offer you jowls of pigs. The children will reach for [eat] the fishy-smelling things and tadpoles, shellfish and “climbers,” and will eat funeral-, pahang- and sorcery-meat. But grudge them not, ye deities, because kahiu, which is a sweeping rite [is being enjoined you], and we are sending you this meat.

HIKGUT: September—August—When first using rice from the store in the attic.

From the harvested rice the Ifugao first fills his fire-frame with bundles straddled on poles and hanging above the fire to dry. Then he fills his attic with another supply, and finally his granary, if he has a granary (many households do not). When he has used up the rice on the fire-frame, and must begin on the supply in the attic, he takes a rice-field spider and a snail, and wraps them in a coconut sheath along with some cooked rice.

Invocation: The bases of the Paybackables and the Clustered-Villages Deities. Sacrifice: none necessary, but some people use dried pigs’ jowls.

Charge: Ye are invoked because it is a hikgut rite, and wrap up the eating basket of the children, but be there miraculous increase of the cooked rice so that it will be outraced by the udingan fish, and be the stomachs of the children quiet like bamboo joints, like nose flutes. Let its vapors descend and let it last till the red light of the Downstream Region and of the Upstream Region, because hikgut is being prayed you.

After the hikgut rite the binudbud (tying) rite is again performed (q. v., p. 114).

APUI: When rice is first taken from a layer in the granary.

A rite similar to that above is performed when the supply in the attic is exhausted so that the granary has to be opened, and thereafter whenever rice is first taken from a new layer of bundles. The first apui is a much more pretentious rite than subsequent ones, however, with a large supply of wine to which relatives and friends are invited and with the sacrifice of chickens and sometimes a pig.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual173,Ponga Marriage Ritual,"Marriage of Kindred

First cousins are prohibited from marrying, but second and third cousins may marry after performance of a rite called ponga. This was formerly preceded by a mock fight—an observance that fell into desuetude about two generations ago.

The kindred of the bridegroom would go armed to the village of the bride and assemble at the house of one of her neighbors. The kindred of the bride would be waiting at her house, also armed. The two parties would pick a quarrel with each other in some such words as these:

Boy’s kindred: “We have come for the debt you owe us.”

Girl’s kindred: “Debt? We owe you nothing. We borrow only within our own family!”

Boy’s kindred: “Is it lost? Have you forgotten?”

Girl’s kindred: “Yes, of course it’s lost because we never borrowed. Take your impudence to your own village and get out!”

Boy’s kindred: “What? Are you quarrelsome? Well, let’s fight it out.”

Then would ensue a mock combat in which real spears were thrown. Ngidulu says they “tried not to hit each other but it was up to a man to keep his eyes open because there might be bad shots.” Even if a man got hurt, the marriage, it is said, would still take place. The relatives would say of him, “It was his fate.” After “fighting” for a while, somebody would cry, “Enough, enough! Let’s arrange it by an intermarriage, else a pity for our bodies.” Then they would perform a peacemaking rite, invoking the ancestors and the hidit.

Charge: Ye Ancestors are invoked because we who were enemies are making peace. We will give each other food and will pass the cup around, but go the vapors straight downward and be we like Talal of Ambuaiya and Crow of Amlinahudan and Serpent Eagle of the Downstream Region. Let not the children who introduce an intermarriage (to terminate their enmity) become rusty or fat-sided. But let their kindreds approve and abound they in life and be their chickens and pigs abundant in life and grow the children rapidly. Let what they plant live, be there miraculous increase of the rice and be the enemies and Westcomers shunted aside. Because hidit rite is what is being enjoined.

There followed the usual myth recitation of the peacemaking rite. After that there was a general-welfare feast in which a large pig and several chickens were offered—it is this part of the ponga that is continued to this day. The invocation is to the Ancestors, the Messengers, the Clustered-Villages deities and the Omen deities.

Charge (to the Paybackables): Ye Paybackables are offered a chicken so that ye shall not curse those who are making a rite not motivated by sickness, who are uniting [in marriage]. And ye are exhorted to give out abundance of life of pigs and chickens and the turning aside of enemies and evil spirits, the rapid growth of rice, because a rite not motivated by sickness is what is being prayed unto you, Paybackables.

If the bile-sac of the chicken sacrificed to the Paybackables be “good,” then the fat pig is sacrificed to the Gods of Reproduction and the marriage rites go forward as usual.

The mock fight is evidently magical in conception, as also is the peace-making rite that follows it. The premises seem to be: marriage within the prohibited degrees is interdicted and shameful. The fight removes the shame and interdiction by making the two parties enemies, between whom marriage is permissible and even laudable. Or perhaps the reasoning is thus: Kindred do not fight and do not intermarry; if we fight we are not kindred and may intermarry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual174,Vengeance Ceremony,"The Vengeance Ceremonies

The vengeance ceremonies are very different in spirit and character from those just described, and it was possibly to counteract their frenzied ferocity that the latter were invented. They are called mungámu-gáman, and really last for seven mornings, since the one held on the morning of the burial day is essentially the same in purpose as those held on the six following. The true vengeance ceremony is not held until the omen spirit appears with the decree of fate. Should it appear with a favorable decree on the morning of the burial day, vengeance will be obtained very soon; but if on any of the following six days, it is held that vengeance will be obtained in as many months as the number of days waited. Should it not appear at all during these days, it is doubtful if vengeance will ever be obtained.

At the vengeance ceremony for Bahatan the omen spirit appeared at about 7 o’clock on the third morning after the burial, and ate of the meat and blood. Therefore, it was held that vengeance would be obtained within three months. (As a matter of fact this prediction came true.) The ceremonies on the first and second days were the same as those at the munûbûb held on the morning of the burial day, except that the time was from sunrise to about 7.30 o’clock instead of from 10 o’clock until noon. Also, from 50 to 100 young men were present who from time to time sang vengeance songs and songs addressed to the omen spirit asking him to come quickly. When the idu appeared in the form of a small bird everyone remained silent until it had finished its meal and flitted away in the general direction of Liñgai. The priests then all arose and shouted a few words after the departing spirit. The young men returned to their homes, to spread the news, while the priests immediately proceeded to the house of Bukahan (the brother of Bahatan) in the village of Dîmpal, where the two hogs had been taken on the afternoon of the burial day. The most interesting ceremony of the whole series then took place, but as it is described in detail by Barton in Part III of this paper, I will mention it only briefly, putting in the few details in which the Central Ifugao ceremony differs from that of Kiáñgan Ifugao.

The ceremony was addressed principally to the great deities of the Sky World ( Ad Daya) and the Upper World ( Ad Kabúnian), who are the gods of war and fighting. The most important of these deities are: Manahaut (the Deceiver), Amalgo (the chief of the Sun Gods), Ambulan (the chief of the Moon Gods), Lubog, Pawit, Halañgob, Amtalu, Amtilâg, etc. Various of the priests were possessed by these deities. Amalgo speared the pig and Ambulan threw himself upon it, drinking the spurting blood until he was pulled away. Several of the priests seized handfuls of the blood and smeared themselves from head to foot. The pig was still living, but was soon killed in the ordinary manner by piercing its heart with a sharpened stick (the wiwik). After the hair had been burned off, the body was cut up with scant ceremony and a small portion cooked. The meat was divided among the priests and the near relatives of Bahatan.

One hog was killed in the forenoon and the other in the afternoon of the third day. On that same afternoon a large shallow pit, about 3 meters square and 1 meter deep, was dug on the plateau where the ceremonies of the previous mornings had been held. The ceremonies of the fourth, fifth, and sixth mornings took place around this pit, and were all alike. From two to three hundred young and middle-aged warriors with spears and shields danced a mimic battle and sang songs of vengeance from sunrise until about 7 o’clock. At the same time two old priests sat in the center of the pit, where a small fire was built, and performed a religious ceremony over some of the meat of the hogs killed on the third day. The warriors danced and sang themselves into a frenzy disquieting to look upon. Some women and children who had gone up to the plateau on the fourth morning ran away in fright when the dance reached its height. After this ceremony the men returned home thoroughly exhausted and did little or no work on that day.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual175,General Ritual Elements,"Of Rites in General

General Ritual Elements. The ritual acts that enter into every complete rite are:

Gonob, the invocation of ancestors or deities by name.

Duyun, charge or “prayer” to the deities invoked. Usually there is first a general invocation to the whole class, and after that a special injunction is repeated for every three to six deities invoked with, perhaps, some change or adaptation to the varying natures or functions of the little groups. Often the special injunctions are considerably abridged.

Aiyag, the call or “invitation” to an ancestor or deity to come and possess.

Hikkop, the possession of a priest by an ancestor or deity.

Tobal, the exhortation to the possessing deity by a bystander or priest, setting forth the purpose of the feast and the will of the Ifugaos—not practised very much in Central Ifugao but greatly used in the Kiangan District.

Offerings. Mention has already been made of the fact that rites are always attended by some sort of offering: it may be only a betel nut, a chicken claw and some feathers, or an oblation of rice wine. These would be meet for the deities’ acceptance in only the most trivial rites.

A frequently used offering in minor rites is the dried skin and adherent fascia of a pig’s jowls. This part of the swine is taboo for everybody to eat—even for the old priests who are less bound by food taboos than other folk—and so it is dried and used as an offering time after time, especially in the aiyag rite for recovering a soul believed either strayed, stolen, or enticed away. A somewhat more pretentious offering consists of rice cakes.

But in nearly all rites of importance, the victims offered are either chickens or one or more pigs plus chickens. In Kiangan, certain rites of sorcery require a dog as victim, accompanied, perhaps, by chickens and/or a pig, while in Central Ifugao the same rites require at least one duck. I heard once of the use of a goat as victim but the offering of that animal is exceedingly rare. The Ifugao who might be convinced that an offering was imperative might probably offer even a fish or a cat if he could secure nothing else. In certain rituals of the wealthy, namely prestige feasts, funerals, sometimes marriages or birth rites, one or more carabaos are offered. The carabao is always offered to the ancestors, never, I believe, to the deities.

Rice wine and betels are offered in every ritual. The use of tobacco as an offering is not very frequent, but is growing—perceptibly so since I went to Ifugaoland thirty-four years ago.

Locale and accoutrement of rites Nearly all rites are performed in or beneath the house or beneath the granary. However, some of the hunting, head-hunting and agricultural rites and the aiyag (soul re-calling) rite are performed in forest or field. The aiyag is performed on a high point in the neighborhood in which the soul is believed to have left the sick person’s body.

If the rites be performed underneath house or granary, a mat made of parallel rune reeds tied together with rattan and large enough to cover the space between the four piles is unrolled. On it are placed wine jars—some of them highly prized and excessively valued antiques—baskets containing bunches of freshly plucked betel clusters, the bulol images perhaps (see p. 80), wooden bowls filled with rice wine on which float coconut shell drinking cups, and, in sorcery rites the sorcery box, or in granary rituals the ritual trough. For some rituals, the house is decorated with sugar cane tops and the granary with hanganga leaves or with sugar cane. The priests squat on the mat among the wine jars and around the wine bowls.

Program of rites. Every great ritual occasion has certain special features; still, neglecting these, nearly all ritual occasions conform to a general program. It is:

1. Invocation of the ancestors: The most closely related ancestors are invoked first: “Ay-y-y-y ka’n hi ama ’n hi Bulan, hi ama ’n hi Gedgedik, hi ina ’n hi Dulduli....” (Ay-y-y-y! thou, Father [or Uncle] Bulan, Father [Uncle] Gedgedik, Mother [Aunt] Dulduli...) continuing on with a prayer for what is wanted. Each priest invokes his own ancestors, but if these overlap with those of another priest who is present, it may be agreed that one or the other will be the only one to invoke that lineage. Not long ago, at preliminaries to a prestige feast, I heard one priest ask a kindred one, “Hast neglected the Nagakadans, hasn’t thou?” “Where’s your mind? [Keep your shirt on!]—I invoked them long ago.” The two were related through an ancestor that had come from distant Nagakadan.

2. Possession by the ancestors: The ancestors come one by one and possess the priest. Each drinks a sip of rice wine (through the priest) and declares that he will confer the benefits besought.

3. Invocation of the deities: The number of deities invoked depends on several factors, the more important of which are: the particular rite itself, the number of priests present, the number and character of the victims, the conscientiousness and personal feelings of the priests. In my descriptions of particular rites that follow, I have named the classes of deities that would probably be invoked in rites performed at a middle-class house.

Before beginning the invocation, the leader among the priests, mamonghal, allots the classes of deities to be invoked—one or two or three classes to each priest. If many classes have to be allotted to a priest, or if only a chicken is to be sacrificed to several classes, then, as has been said, only the “base” of each class will be invoked. In the pages that follow I have as a rule set forth the invocations to only one or two classes of deities out of the many classes invoked, since the invocations to all of them are pretty much alike.

The makalun “messengers” are invoked before the rest of the deities, sometimes by one priest, sometimes by two or three. They are asked to intercede with the deities in accordance with the purpose of the rites and to invite them to the feast. After a few minutes spent in gossip, the priests then invoke the deities assigned them.

4. Possession by the deities: Possession occurs only if at least a pig and one or two chickens are offered. The priest first commands the deity to come. The deity then possesses, making his presence in the priest known by the possession-note Tsay-ay-ay-ay! (in Kiangan) or Hi-ye-e-e-e-eh! (in Central Ifugao). He then declares his name and habitat, expresses his satisfaction in the feast and wine, declares that he will do what is wanted of him and then, with a fading possession note, leaves the priest and goes home. In the greater rituals such as the harvest feast, the activation of a bulol image, prestige feasts, the ubaiya and head-hunting rites, the “base” deities of certain classes cause the priests to dance and cavort while oblating the victims, making ceremonial processions, shaking clappers, brandishing spears over victims, covering them with blankets and the like. When the rite is of this kind, the classes in question are called to possess the priests one by one, while on ordinary occasions the classes are called to possess simultaneously, each priest calling the class that was assigned him.

5. Sacrifice of victims: Chickens are offered throughout the ritual occasion, whenever the possession by the class or classes of deities to whom they are offered has terminated. The throat is cut with a knife or bamboo sliver. Pigs are not offered until termination of all invocations of all classes of deities except sometimes a few minor ones. They are turned on their backs, a slit is made in the skin at the distal end of the sternum, a stick is thrust into the chest and rammed back and forth until the animal dies from hemorrhage or puncture of a large vessel. The squealing is terrific. Whenever a victim is being offered, the priests hurriedly repeat the names of the deities to whom it is given.

The victims are singed over a fire until hair or feathers be burned off, cut up by a process that never varies, then thrown into the pot.

6. Myth recitations: “The Raw Eaters.” (See p. 86).

7. Quenching rite: When the cauldron has been removed from the fire, water is thrown on the coals and an invocation in the spirit of the occasion is pronounced by the priest (pp. 106, 119).

8. Despatching the savor: Cooked meat is piled on cooked rice heaped high in flat baskets. The rising steam is blown toward the village of an enemy and is invoked to go thither without dissemination and straight into the enemy’s nostrils. This is in order that he break (never mind that it be unwittingly) the taboo against partaking of the food of an enemy (see p. 109).

9. Myth recitation: As many myths are recited as there are priests participating. A man need not be a full-fledged priest—that is, one that can be possessed by deities—in order to participate in myth recital.

Before beginning his declamation, each priest names ( gonob) the characters of his myth. Then he charges them in a duyun (which differs from a prayer in that it commands rather than supplicates). He then embarks on his declamation.

10. Attitude of auditors: On all ritual occasions of pretension, there will be an audience of boys, women and girls—unless the last two should be working in the fields. The attitude of the audience is not at all reverent. It is that of any audience at a theatrical performance. The myth narratives are all lost in the jumble of simultaneous declamation, but the whole “sounds well.” There is commendation of some performers and laughter always at the antics of a priest under possession by a deity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual176,First Day,"First Day: Lu-a′t chi pa′koy, Bringing-out of the Rice

Early in the morning, as soon as the cock crows for the first time (the Mayawyaw count their days from morning to morning, from cock-crow to cock-crow), husband and wife rise up, and place in the middle of the floor of their house a couple of small rice-wine jars,—for instance, one gu′ling and one chala′y. They call the priest, who usually in such circumstances has passed the night in the neighborhood or in the hut on the same houseground, and who then enters the house and begins at once with the invocations.

He begins with the invocation of the Libliba′djan-deities (see Rr, 6 pp. 30-32) with the terminal prayer:

Do not again spear the stomach of the Ifugaw / for we shall bring out [take from the storing place] the rice / we shall pound the rice / we shall perform the Ipad, / and participate in eating [in drinking] / [you] Stomach-ache-deities of the Underworld, / Stomach-ache-deities of the Skyworld, / Stomach-ache-deities of this village, / this rice-wine, rice-wine of this two which is a household (husband and wife), / that may live both this household.

After this the priest says the invocation of the Pina′ching-ghost-deities (Rr, 32-34) with the terminal prayer:

Do not again steal, / do not spear / [you] Pinading-ghost-deities of the Underworld, / Pinading-ghost-deities of the Skyworld, / Pinading-ghost-deities of this houseground, / for we shall bring out the rice, / we shall pound the rice, / we shall perform the Ipad, / participate in eating [drinking] this rice-wine, / rice-wine of both this household, / that may live both this household.

Now comes the invocation of the Ghosts of the Ancestors of the married couple (see, for similar invocation, Rr, 34-35) with the terminal prayer:

Immediately after this the priest, omitting the ama′h or announcement prayer, says the invocations of the Anini′to deities and the Buni′in deities

The priest then repeats the invocation of the Buni′h Pe′tnong ad Chalo′m (Rr, 57-58), and kills a small chicken while he says the following prayer:

Here your victim Deities Giving-growth of the Underworld, / for we shall bring out the rice, / we shall pound the rice, / and they will perform the Ipad both this household.

The priest puts the small chicken aside and repeats the invocation of the Buni′ ad La′gud (Rr, 51-53) and kills another small chicken, saying the same prayer as the foregoing, mutatis mutandis.

As there is no ritual-box, the blood of the two victims falls on the floor, or onto a wooden plate. We may also note that sometimes only one chicken is killed; in this case it is offered to the Buni′ ad La′gud.

The priest now scrutinizes the bile-sacs of the victims. One bad bile-sac means that the deities dislike the I′pad, and consequently no other rites shall be done: the feast will be postponed. If the bile-sacs are good, two men go to the granary or the storing place of the rice, take two bundles of rice, and pound them in the mortar under the house: it is this rice also which is cooked for the meal of this very sacrifice. From now on they are allowed to take from the storing place as many rice bundles as they will need for the solemnities of the following days.

While the meal is being prepared the priest narrates the Abu′wab magical tale.

1. Are living Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan, / lived in the marital state Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan, / were in good condition their chickens and their pigs and their children, / they farmed and farmed their rice in their fields at Dukligan.

2. During the night / and slept Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan: / [the following is what they see in their dream] and was piled and piled up their rice / and became plentiful their rice / and their pigs and their chickens and their children.

3. When morning the day / says Wigan: / “We shall then perform the Ipad, / we shall bring out the rice”. / Looks down Wigan of the Skyworld / and comes down / and says to Bugan and Wigan. at Dukligan: / “Are you going to perform the Ipad?”

4. Says Wigan the Ifugaw: / “Yes, we bring out the rice”. / Says Wigan of the Skyworld: / “Yes”. He gets their rice, / he is going to bring out the rice / from the corner of the storing place, / and there is the Earthquaker of the Underworld / who is sitting.

5. And says the Earthquaker of the Underworld: / “Are you coming here?” / Says Wigan of the Skyworld: / “Yes, I am going to bring out the rice of Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan / and they will perform the Ipad”. / Says the Earthquaker of the Underworld: / “Yes, let us bring out their rice / and they will perform the Ipad”.

6. They come also to another corner / and there is the Thunderer of the Skyworld. / Says the Thunderer of the Skyworld: / “Are you coming here?” / Says Wigan of the Skyworld: / “Yes, we will bring out the rice of Bugan and Wigan / and they will perform the Ipad”. / Says the Thunderer of the Skyworld: / “Yes, let us bring out their rice / and they will perform the Ipad”.

7. They come also to another corner / of the storing place / and there are the Deity Giving-growth of the Underworld / and the Deity of the Skyworld / and the River-deity / and the Deity of the Lagud / and they say: / “Are you uncovering us?” / Says Wigan of the Skyworld: / “Yes, we bring out the rice of Bugan and Wigan / and they will perform the Ipad”. / And they say: “Yes, and they will perform the Ipad”.

8. And they brought out the rice of Bugan and Wigan of Dukligan. / And Wigan of the Skyworld / goes to get the sifting-bask′et / of the pinading [people] of Dukligan [Mayawyaw] / and he goes to remove the grains [from the stalks of the rice-ears] / of the rice of Bugan and Wigan of Dukligan.

9. When finished then says Wigan of the Skyworld: / “Go ahead! Wigan the Ifugaw and Bugan the Ifugaw, / and pound both of you”. / They pounded / and they cooked what was to ferment [for the rice-wine]. / Says Wigan of the Skyworld: / “Where is it that which we shall use as leaven?” / Says Bugan: “Wait, and I shall go there where are the sweet potatoes”.

10. Goes Bugan [to the sweet-potato field] and works with the chaleh-knife [to gather sweet potatoes], / and there are rice birds / and they ate the herb / which is leaven, and they were drunk. / And gets Bugan one rice bird / and puts it in her halidong-basket / and when hidden the sun / she goes to their house.

11. Arrived Bugan at their house at Dukligan / and she removed her blanket [from the basket] / and it is a rice bird which is there, / and says Wigan the Ifugaw: / “What did you get, this?” / Says Bugan: / “Yes, I got one rice bird / which ate herbs / and it was drunk”.

12. And Wigan dissected its body, / smelled and says: / “Bring back this herb”. / Goes Bugan and gets it / and it is leaven, and she brings it home.

13. And they make the fermentation cake, / and spreads Wigan of the Skyworld the fermentation cake [over the cooked rice], and is ready to drink [properly: is cooked; ready to eat] the rice-wine. / Says Wigan the Ifugaw: / “Let us then perform the Ipad, / and we shall pound rice”.

14. They pound their rice / and perform the Ipad Bugan and Wigan of Dukligan. / On account of this are living Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan, / and multiply their rice and their pigs and their chickens and their children.

When the meal is ready the priest says the prayer: Ooooo oweeee, hangu′wom tun mano′- (as in Rr, 73-74), inviting only the Buni′h Pe′tnong ad Chalo′m and the Buni′ ad La′gud to eat in company with them. Only the husband and wife, the priest, and the two men who pounded the first rice-bundles, partake of the meal.

In the meantime relatives and neighbors have arrived to help in preparing the feast. Some go to the granary or to the storing place of the rice in the house and bring a great number of rice bundles onto the houseground, chadja′-ot rice for the rice-wine and ordinary rice for the banquet; others remove the grains from the stalks; others pound rice; others go to get firewood; others watch the broad iron pot in which the rice for the rice-wine is cooking, others again wash and clean the jars and prepare all that is needed for the rice-wine; others go to press sugar cane; and of course others do nothing but just sit on their heels. Before night they all go home to sleep.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual177,Second Day of the Ipad,"Second Day of the I′pad

Shortly after midnight, the priest offers a small sacrifice to the Pina′ching-ghost-deities and the Star-deities. The Pina′ching indeed may steal the rice-wine if they are not given beforehand a small victim, while the Star-deities may make those who will partake of the feast too crazy when they will have become intoxicated. To each class of deities a small chicken is then given.

The priest. sitting inside the house, near a couple of jars containing rice-wine, begins the sacrifice with the invocations of the Libliba′djan--deities, the Pina′ching-ghost-deities and the Ghost of the Ancestors (Rr. 30-35): the terminal prayer is: te o′ncha mangi′pad tun chu′wan himbale′, for will perform the Ipad both this household.

After this comes a repetition of the invocation of the Pina′ching--ghost-deities, and when it is finished the priest takes a small chicken and kills it while he says the following prayer:

Here your victim, / Pinading of the Underworld, / Pinading of the Skyworld, / Pinading of Amuyaw mountain, / Pinading of Kalawitan mountain, / Pinading of Amangalo mountain, / Pinading of Ambulan mountain, / Pinading of Pagangapang mountain, / Pinading of Nakdayan mountain, / Pinading of Batu, Nibatu [his name; means, “in the stone”] of Batu, / Pinading of Uluhan, Taynub [his name] of Uluhan, / Pinading of Alulug, Ginga [his name] of Alulug, / Pinading of Bongan, / and the Grown-up of this neighborhood, / do not again steal what is cooked [the rice-wine ready to drink], / for perform the Ipad both his household.

A few minutes later the priest recites a single invocation of the Mi-lala′bi and the Bittu′won deities (Rr, 112-114) without terminal prayer, and at once kills another small chicken while he says the following prayer:

Here your victim, / Night-beings of the Underworld, / Night-beings of the Skyworld, / and Star-deities, / do not again make crazy / those who drink this rice-wine, / the rice-wine of both this household, / so that they may not fight and fight /in this Ipad of both this household / so that may live both this household, / and their pigs and their chickens and their children.

They then scrutinize the bile-sacs: a bad bile-sac signifies that the particular petition is not granted by the interested deities. However, even though the omen at this juncture be bad, the feast will go on.

While the meal is being prepared, the priest performs the Pa′nga rites [ Pa′nga, with one ng; not Pa′ngnga, which is the name of a sacrifice in the Rice Ritual, 28 ff.].

The priest comes and sits before a wooden plate containing rice-wine and drops into the wine some herbs,—namely bu′nga, ha′-nib, hi′gub and o′dja, all herbs growing in the forest. We have been unable to identify these herbs, but we have heard from the natives that the intoxicating power of the rice-wine becomes much greater if any of these herbs is mixed in the beverage.

In front of all this the priest narrates the Abu′wab tale, after having recited a short invocation of the Ancestors who were also priests:

Ancestors of the other side / who are also priests, / who also perform the abuwab tale the panga-abuwab / at the Ipad of both this household. / Ancestor Pakali, / Ancestor Haguban... etc., / you who perform the abuwab, / ancestors who are also priests / who also perform the abuwab tale, the panga-abuwab.

Then follows the Abu′wab tale. [...] Then they return to the houseground whence they came, without beating the shields.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual178,"Third Day of the Ipad. Punhicha′an, the Banquet (A) The Chalo′ng Rite","Third Day of the Ipad. Punhicha′an, the Banquet (A) The Chalo′ng Rite

Early in the morning, as soon as the landscape is visible ( mati′go chi lu′ta) three men and a boy, — mostly relatives or neighbors of those who perform the Ipad,—set out from the houseground where the feast will be celebrated, and go toward a mountain declivity, where no farming is being done. The three men hold a shield ( hapi′yaw) in the left hand, which shield they beat with a stick ( po′lag) at the present time, instead of with a spear as formerly. The one who walks first gives a strong beat and then the two others in turn each a short beat, so that every beat corresponds more or less with a double step of the men: mumpagi′pagcha. The boy follows and carries on his back a small knapsack ( ina′mun) or an ordinary knapsack ( ba′ngaw).

When they arrive at a suitable spot on the uncultivated mountain declivity they stop and make a small hut: a small sloping roof of long grasses ( gu′lun), about 1 sq. meter, resting on one side against the declivity and supported on the other side by two small posts. Under this roof they cut the grass and level the ground somewhat. This hut is constructed purposely for the A′bat and Umi′chaw ghost-deities: a shelter for them to cook what they shall receive during the sacrifice. For this purpose the party puts some sticks for the deities’ firewood ( itungo′cha: their fuel), and rice straw ( u′lut) to communicate the fire to the firewood, and plants in the ground three short sticks in the form of a triangle which must support the cooking pot of the ghost-deities ( chali-a′ncha: a facsimile of the chali-a′n, that is, the three stones of the fireplace on which the Ifugaw put their pots).

When they are through with this one of the men says:

Here your cooking place, Abat and Umidaw ghost-deities, / as perform the Ipad both this household, / and we return to the village.

Then they return to the houseground whence they came, without beating the shields.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual179,"Third Day of the Ipad. Punhicha′an, the Banquet (B) The Lo′glog Rite","(B) The Lo′glog Rite
As soon as these men arrive back the priest recites the following Abu′wab tale before a coconut-cup or a wooden plate, containing water in which is dipped a bundle of rice-bundle straw the top of which has been burned previously, and a piece of lo′glog. This lo′glog is a kind of earth containing a substance which makes it smooth; it is often used by the people to wash their face and hands, just as we use soap.

Ancestors of the other side, / who are also priests, / who also perform the loglog rite. / Ancestor Pakali.... who also perform the loglog-abuwab / at the Ipad of both this household.

1. Are living Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan, / live in a marital state Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan, / were in good condition their chickens and their pigs and their children, / they farmed and farmed their rice in their fields at Dukligan.

2. When morning the day / the saying of Bugan / who gave birth: / “Go to participate in drinking, / Wigan and Panguldihon and Pangudyawon the rice-wine”. / And they say: “Yes”. / And they go.

3. They arrived at the house of those who perform the Ipad / and drink the pinading [people] their rice-wine. / And say the pinading [people]: “You shall not participate in drinking”. / And they give their rice-wine / to other people.

4. And they killed pigs / and they do not also give [meat] to Wigan and Panguldihon and Pangudyawon. / And they say: “Let us go then”. / And they went to their house.

5. And there is their mother Bugan, / the wife of Wigan. / And say Panguldihon and Pangudyawon: / “They do not give to eat to us”. / Says Bugan: / “Do you see this bullu-bamboo / which became tall / which upset the enemies / of our ancestors [the hereditary enemies: Bugan sees this in fancy, and concludes that they have to start with a fighting expedition]?” / They say: “Ignorance [we do not see, we do not understand]”.

6. Says Bugan: / “Let us then start with a fighting expedition / because they do not give to drink to you”. / And Bugan gets rice [bundles] / pounds [the rice] so that they will have food to carry [and to eat during the expedition]. / Gets also Wigan their shields / and spears and knives / and go Panguldihon and Pangudyawon.

7. They go then on a fighting expedition / and [but] went [away] the enemies / of their ancestors [hereditary enemies], / and no one comes. / And they do not also return. / Says Bugan: “Why! do not come Panguldihon and Pangudyawon, / I shall follow them”.

8. She gets betelnuts / and chewing-leaves / and lime / and cooked rice, / and puts this on her head and goes. / She arrived at [the place where are] Panguldihon and Pangudyawon and says: / “Why do you not come out?” / They say: “No enemy who comes [the bravery of the Mayawyaw is not so great that they would go to the very home of their enemies; they lie in ambush to kill in a cowardly manner and by surprise one or another enemy who may pass along the path where they hide: see Death Ritual]”.

9. Says Bugan: “I am the one who will go”. / Goes Bugan, / and brought the cooked rice / and the betelnuts and chew-leaves and lime / and gave them to their enemies / of Tulaid and of Mamina and of Nuntagayang [villages in the south of Mayawyaw].

10. And she says: “Here, you eat / so that you will die [there is a curse attached to the rice, betels, etc.] / you who also perform cursing sacrifices [see Death Ritual and Illness Ritual]”. / And returns Bugan / and passed by Panguldihon and Pangudyawon / they came all together at their house at Dukligan.

11. And they get a coconut cup / and they get a bundle of rice-bundle straw and water, / and they perform the abuwab tale, the loglog. / On account of this are living Bugan and Wigan at Dukligan, / and multiply their rice / and their chickens and their pigs and their children.

After this tale the men who made the hut in the previously described Chalo′ng rite, wash their faces, using the bundle of rice-bundle straw. Much in the foregoing Chalo′ng and Lo′glog rites will become clearer when fighting expeditions will be dealt with under Death Ritual. It may however be mentioned here that these rites are to a certain extent a simulation of a fighting expedition; they have the character of a revenge undertaking against enemies who may possibly have performed cursing sacrifices for the purpose of keeping the Mayawyaw from being happy and from showing their wealth by means of great festivities. We may say that these rites are carried out just before the feast, in order to neutralize a possible curse put by jealous enemies. The fact that the men who made the hut and simulated the fighting expedition, wash their faces, seems to mean that now the war is over, and that the revenge is taken or at least that the curse is no more to be feared. Warriors in fact do not bathe so long as the expedition is being carried on; but afterwards they must take a bath: they are said to bathe their enmity. They can then also partake of the feast.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Husband and wife, a few of their relatives, and the priests take their breakfast, which consists of cooked rice and some meat of the victims of the preceding day. After this they go home to sleep and to rest.

During the morning the heads of the pigs are cooked, and before the children eat them (for only children eat the heads of the pigs) a priest says the following prayer:

Oooo oweeee, inhale, / [you] Earthquaker of the Underworld, / Thunderer of the Skyworld, / Bright-being Bugan wife of the Sun, / Lingan the Moon, / Night-beings and Star-deities, / Deity Giving- growth of the Underworld, / Deity of the Skyworld, / River-deity, / Deity of the Lagud / and Foetus-maker Deities, / offer both this household / the heads of the pigs, / the jaws of the pigs, inhale them / so that may live both this household / so that they may be prolific, / so that may multiply their rice / and their chickens and their pigs and their children.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual182,Fifth Day of the I′pad: The Ala′wit Sacrifice,"Fifth Day of the I′pad: The Ala′wit Sacrifice

The Ala′wit sacrifice is the complement of the solemn Pa′hang or the I′pad. During the feast a great quantity of rice has been consumed, and now they see that later on they will be very much in need of rice for their daily food. Consequently they ask the deities, and in particular the Deity of the Lagud, for whom they offer a pig in this sacrifice, to return the soul of their rice, as if it had been stolen, or to multiply miraculously the rice which is left so that the supply will last longer.

The sacrifice begins as usual, inside the house, with the invocations of the Stomach-ache-deities (as in Rr, 30-32), the Pina′ching-ghost-deities (Rr, 32-34), and the Ghosts of the Ancestors (Rr, 34-35). The final words of these invocations are: te Ala′wit tun Pa′hang tun chu′wan himbale′, for it is the Alawit sacrifice of the Pahang sacrifice of both this household.

(1) Gi′nid Rite. In the middle of the floor of the house are placed all the empty rice-wine jars, one jar containing some rice-wine, and the ritual-box. The priests—there are usually some three or four of them—squat on their heels around these objects. The high-priest, or another priest if the high-priest does not come, takes a gu′ling jar in both his hands and begins singing the gi′nid song, in the same melody as the a′lim songs (see Rr, 135). While he is busy singing, he goes with the gu′ling jar from one empty jar to another, stopping a little at each jar, and another priest—or just a layman—keeps beating with a miniature spear ( pini′yaw) the gu′ling jar, which is held by the high-priest. These ritual actions are called the gi′nid.

1. Let us invite Bugan, / Bugan daughter of the Arranger, / the Arranger of the Underworld, / who arranges at the Underworld, / arranges at the Underworld, / and she is the one who comes up, / she is the one who comes up, / and she arranges [manages] the ginid, / arranges the ginid, / and does the ginid to two guling jars, / does the ginid to two tagolan jars, / and she goes to know about the place where are put / the two guling jars, / the place where are put the two tagolan jars, / is placed and will be big [rich], / is placed and is rich; / when does the ginid Manchi / and Inggolyo wife of Angiwan [names of the married couple who are supposed to be giving the feast]; / and they look at [assist] the ahiw [alawit], / they look at the Alawit, / they look at the alawag [alawit], / when performed the ahiw Geeng, / when performed the alawit Geeng, / when performed the alawag Geeng, / and will live his child, / will live his baby.

2. Let us invite Nabunlan, / Nabunlan of the Underworld, / and is piled up his rice, / piled up [many] his chickens, / piled up [many] his pigs, / piled up [many] his children, / and he is the one who comes up, etc.

3. Let us invite Bugan, / Bugan wife of Guminid at the Underworld, / and she is the one who is invited, / she is the one who is invited, / she is the one who comes up, / she is the one who comes up, / and she does the ginid with two spears, / does the ginid with two piniyaw spears, / and she goes to know about / the place where they put the two spears, / the place where they put the two piniyaw spears, / is placed and will be big [rich], etc.

After this the priest sings a second time this preceding part (no. 3) of the gi′nid song.

When the song is finished, some one puts the gu′ling jar, the one which is held by the high-priest and in which there is a big piece of cooked meat (see also infra), in a ba′llag basket, and carries it to the granary, or else to the houseground if there is no granary on the same houseground. This cooked meat has been put aside after the great sacrifice of the feast. The priests also come down and go to the granary. There, inside the granary, some one takes out of the basket the gu′ling jar containing the meat, and puts it in the middle of the floor; others bring the ritual-box and one or two jars containing rice-wine and put them likewise in the middle of the floor, and the priests go ahead with the rites. If there is no granary, all the following rites are done on the houseground.

(2) Invocations of the Deities. One priest invokes the Stomach-ache-deities, and another the Pina′ching-ghost-deities, as was done in the beginning inside the house; but these two invocations are omitted if the rites are done on the houseground. The high-priest invokes the Ancestors who were also priests (as in Rr, 43-44) and says the Ama′h prayer, as on p. 239 supra, mutatis mutandis: instead of saying ta o′ncha mangi′pad tun chu′wan himbale′, he says: ta o′ncha munala′wit tun chu′wan himbale′, and they will perform the Alawit both this household. Then the priests recite the announcement invocations, as on p. 239 supra.

After this they all go down and continue the rites under the granary. At one of the posts of the granary lies the pig, or the small pig (- i′nlum), to be offered for the Buni′ ad La′gud. In front of this pig the high-priest squats on his heels, and repeats the invocations, but now chanting them and beginning every invocation with the word pa′ladmu, your call (cf. pp. 244-45 supra).

After having recited once more the invocations of the Buni′ -deities, the Farmer-deities and the Pig-and-chicken-raiser-deities, the priests perform the Gu′ling rite, the Hu′plit rite, the - U′bi rite and the Bu′llug rite (as on pp. 245-46 supra.

A little later, while the drums and gongs are beaten, one of the priests chants:

Immediately after this the priest chants the invocation of the Buni′ ad La′gud, in full and not in its abbreviated form (as in Rr, 51-53).

This being finished some one kills the pig while the priest says:

Here your victim, / Deity (ies) of the Underworld, / Deity (ies) of the Skyworld, / Bright-being Bugan wife of the Sun, / Lingan the Moon, / Night-beings of the Underworld, / Night-beings of the Skyworld, / Star-deities of the Lagud, / Deity (ies) Giving-growth of the Underworld, / Deity (ies) of the Skyworld, / River-deity (ies), / and Deity (ies) of the Lagud, / and we [all of us] offer it [direct it] to the Deity (ies) of the Lagud, / so that may live both this household, / so that may multiply their rice and their chickens and their pigs and their children, / for it is the Alawit sacrifice of both this household.

While the meal is being prepared, the high-priest sings, at intervals, the following Balto′ng songs.

(3) Nata′djan Balto′ng under the Granary. 1. Huu uyuuu ooo oweee, etc. (as supra p. 254).

2. Huu uyuuu ooo oweee, etc. (as ibid.).

(4) Cha′wat Balto′ng in the House. This is the same Balto′ng as given on pp. 243-44 supra, mutatis mutandis, with nos. 4 and 5 as in the preceding Nata′djan Balto′ng.

(5) Huu uyuuu ooo oweee, surely let us invite Bugan, / Bugan daughter of the Arranger, / the Arranger of the Underworld, xxxxxx ooooooeeeeee.

2. Huu uyuuu ooo oweee, the Arranger of the Underworld, / and she [Bugan] arranges the putting of the meat in the jar [see p. 293 supra], / she arranges the putting of the meat in the jar, / and she goes to put in the jar the neck of the pig, / their pig their buliya pig, / and is rotten [the meat indeed is already rotten] the pig, / and smells bad, xxxxxx uuuuuueeeeee.

3. Huu uyuuu ooo oweee, is rotten the pig [the meat of the pig], / smells bad the pig [the meat of the pig], / and they look at the ahiw, etc.

The priest sings two other Balto′ng: the Bunbuni′ Balto′ng and the Buni′ ad La′gud Balto′ng (see supra respectively p. 258 and pp. 258-59, mutatis mutandis, as in the Nata′djan Balto′ng, no. 4 and no. 5).

While these Balto′ng songs were being sung, one of the priests was reciting the two following Abu′wab tales under the granary before the head and the legs of the sacrificed pig.

Ritual183,The simple Pa′hang,"The simple Pa′hang

All the rites are performed inside the house, where have been prepared the ritual-box or basket, and, in the large palo′ngan basket, one blanket ( inabo′l), one clout ( li′nchum), and two small bundles of rice. Near this basket stand some three rice-wine jars containing rice-wine, and a couple of coconut cups for drinking purposes.

The priest recites the invocations of the deities, repeats them in an abbreviated form,—or in full whenever a particular invocation is directed to a class of deities favored with a victim,—and kills the victims. He scrutinizes the bile-sacs, recites the two abu′wab tales, says the ho′nga prayers, and so completes the sacrifice. It is an ordinary sacrifice, with some features proper to the Pa′hang, which will be sufficiently described among the rites of the I′pad-feast.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual184,Initiation,"Initiation

There are no initiation ceremonies for boys, nor age-sets, though most boys and girls served the king in his capital or other village for a time.

Girls, at first menstruation, are secluded in the bush in a hut with two or three companions, married women, spending the day there and returning to their fathers' homesteads at night to sleep. During this period the married women dance and sing round the girl, beating her with sticks, or alternatively instruct her in the physical and psychological aspects of married life. This “rite de passage” ( mwalianjo , Stirke) is terminated by a purificatory rite, in which the girl is washed in the nearest water by the elder women. Gluckman states that after the period of seclusion “the girl is finely dressed and decorated and sits downcast and tearful surrounded by women. Later in the day; escorted by her male guardian and a substitute for her mother, she emerges under a blanket, which the man removes with a hoe and the woman with an axe. The girl fetches water and is abused, then she chooses a new name. The people present dance. The girl is now ready for marriage.”

Holub relates that only a daughter or near relative of the king was secluded in the bush, while a commoner girl was visited by her “companions” in her own home for “about a week.” This may have been the position at the time Holub wrote, but in view of the general agreement between other writers that girls were secluded in the bush it is probable that his account is faulty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual185,Exorcism,"Rites of exorcism are usually employed to combat disease, which is almost always thought to be occasioned by sorcery. They are presided over by a witch-doctor or fetish-expert, or by a diviner or, more rarely, a sorcerer.

The [unknown]naka , or witch-doctor, of the Lozi, Kwangwa and Mbowe, is becoming more of a fetishist, under the influence of the Mbunda and especially of the Lubale, who are introducing fetishism amongst tribes whose religion was formerly limited to the worship of Nyambe and the ancestor spirits. The naka , often possessing real, if limited, medical knowledge, may be a member of the local group -- headmen, elders and hunters often combine with their other functions that of witch-doctor or fetishist -- or he may be called in from another village or even tribe, the Lubale witch-doctors being in great demand. Commonly, the [unknown]naka hypnotises himself, the patient and the onlookers by his contortionist dances.

The mulauli , or diviner, is a psychiatrist and medium. He is usually invited in from a distant part of the country, either because the tribes far from the European centres are thought to possess the most powerful diviners, or so that they can exercise their art freely without fear of vengeance from persons they have divined as culpable. The “professions” of fetishist, diviner and sorcerer are often transmitted from father to son.

The diseases treated by exorcism are, par excellence , psychical disorders, but since the cause of every kind of disease is attributed to sorcery, it is not a long step before all diseases fall under the rubric of psychical disorders i.e. possession by a malignant spirit. Kuntz describes four types of psychical disorders.

Maimbwe and liyala are said to be mild forms of neurasthenia. Maimbwe is said to be produced by the sorcery of the Nkoya, liyala by that of the Lozi.

Macoba , said to be caused by Kaonde sorcery, is a violent form of neurasthenia sometimes leading to death.

Kayongo , caused by Lubale sorcery, is a kind of madness.

The dances of exorcism for these different disorders have the same name as the diseases themselves and indeed reproduce their symptoms, accompanied as they are by the beating of tambourines and the rhythmic clapping of hands by those present. Meanwhile, the head of the sick person is held over a pot of boiling water containing bark, roots and leaves, the vapour of which the patient must inhale. Next he has to bathe in this liquid. The object is to make sure that he shakes off his torpor and begins to dance; he is then said to be cured.

For the liyala a decoction of sweet-smelling white azalea flowers, or other white scented flowers, is added, and the patient is also covered with them. The dancer, the [unknown]naka , wears the ndelwa , a feather head-dress, and leggings of little bells.

For the macoba , a miniature hut is built some distance from the village, and a heap of sand or earth is built there. This is the lilundu , the mountain where the mulimu wa macoba (the spirit of the macoba ) is supposed to answer the call of the fetishist. The latter, clothed in a huge skirt made of sections of threaded reeds and monkeys' and wild cats' tails, holding a rattle which he shakes rhythmically, and a fly-switch, dances at first on the open space in the village. A chicken is killed, its head is hung up on the palisade of the yard, together with a long string of white beads; the fetishist sprinkles the patient with blood of this fowl or smears his hands with it and his breast. When the patient begins to dance, he is given a magic potion to drink in a calabash adorned with white beads. He is then led towards the miniature hut where the spirit dwells. On bended knees, with outstretched hands making gestures of offering and prayer, the men remain in front of this hut and chant an incantation. No one may approach them unless he first offers them some white beads.

The kayongo is thought to be the result of possession by a strong and violent spirit, that of a celebrated hunter for example, or of a person who met a violent end, perhaps by drowning or being killed by a lion. In the latter instance an effigy of the animal is placed close to the spot where the sick man is being tended in a miniature shelter made of grass or wood, so that the revengeful spirit will believe that the guilty animal is slain. If the sick man is possessed by a hunter's ghost, the fetishist -- who must be a powerful specialist -- sets off by day with the patient to the place where the ancestor spirits of this hunter are worshipped; he pours out on the earth a magic potion which fetishist and patient drink up from the earth itself, and which the offended spirit is thought to lap up simultaneously. The fetishist recites incantations. The ceremonies last several days and even weeks; at night the fetishist dances and, to the customary drums is added the singibu , an all wooden resonating-chamber of triangular shape, peculiar to the Mbunda and the Lubale.

In addition to these four great ceremonies of exorcism there are a number of other less common ones. There is, for example, possession of a young child by a hunter-ancestor. In recent times, new similar diseases, sisongo and muba , have swept the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual186,"First Grand Inaugural Act, Ceremony","On the morning of the day before the ceremony, the village is early astir. Two parties are setting off for a day's expedition. Most of the young men of the village prepare their baskets, fill them with yams, tuck aromatic herbs into their armlets, anoint their bodies and put on some paint. Presently they set out for the coastal village with which they have previously arranged the date for the exchange. At the same time the coastal villagers have set sail early in search of fish.

Bagido'u, meanwhile, and perhaps his two brothers with one or two of their friends, are starting in the opposite direction. They are going to the eastern shore and to the adjoining coral ridge, the rayboag , to collect the magical herbs and other ingredients of the complicated mixture which will be prepared for the next day. They also have to take baskets, for among the thirteen elements required are large bunches of leaves, clumps of soil taken from the nest of the bush-hen, chunks of hornets' nest, and bits scraped off squat coral boulders. The towosi and his friends are usually first back in the village. There they sit down in front of his house and, without much ceremony, proceed to the preparation of the mixture. I have been present several times at these proceedings, in Bagido'u's house or in front of it, and have even lent a hand myself. Two mats are spread: the raw materials are deposited on one and shifted to the other as they are made ready for use. All the leaves have to be torn up into small bits; the earth, the pounded chalk and the broken up hornets' nest are mixed separately and strewn over the chopped leaves, which then look like a lightly peppered salad before it is dressed with oil and vinegar.

The magician is usually just about to finish his work when, from the western outskirts of the village, a shrill tilaykiki , an intermittent yell, is heard, and panting, screaming, racing one another, the men with the offering rush in, and throw down the strings of fish at the magician's feet, with the words, kam ula ula da towosi , “thy sacrificial oblation, O garden magician”. Usually they add some such words as, “make our gardens good”, or “offer it to the spirits -- may they bring prosperity to our village”.

Soon after the women gather round the house of the magician, who forthwith distributes the fish so that the whole village can have a festive supper. The men are resting after a very tiring day, for they have had to run on the way back, and usually most of them have their legs bled by means of the miniature bow and arrow arrangement called gipita . Speed is an essential element in the ritual, and it is also necessary so that the fish shall not arrive in a too decayed state. In spite of this, the village reeks with putrefying fish on such ceremonial evenings, so that a white man finds it difficult to remain there. But the ancestral spirits are quite fond of the smell, as are their living descendants.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual187,"First Grand Inaugural Act, Charming of the Axes","After the magician has had his share of fish and the men have rested and eaten their meal, the first magical net of the whole system takes place. All the men bring their axes to the magician, who lays them on a mat spread upon the bunk along the side opposite to the fireplace (cf. Part I, Sec. 8). To each axe a piece of driod banana leaf, about six inches by four, has been tied. The main part of the leaf lies flat against the blade while the other part is left free. After the spell has been uttered the free flap will be folded over; but first some of the magical mixture must be inserted, between the leaf and the cutting edge of the axe, and mixture and blade be left open, so that the voice of the towosi and the magical virtue which it earries can penetrate into the blade and the herbs. After the axes have been placed on the mat, the magician takes some cooked fish and puts it down on one of the three hearthstones in his house with the following words: --

Formula 1

This act as well as the exhortation recited during it is described as “the shredding of the spirits oblation”. The word “to shred” refers here to the tearing off of small bits of fish and placing them on the hearthstone. The words of this incantation are spoken in a slow, solemn, persuasive voice. It is not regarded as a yopa (spell), and it is not uttered in the usual singsong of the magical formulae. The natives conceive of it as being spoken directly to the ancestral spirits by the towosi , as from one man to another.

The blessing of the spirits being thus invoked, and their presence in a vague, mystical way established, the magician now proceeds to the charming of the axes. He places a second mat over the axes, only leaving a sufficient aperture for the breath carrying his words to penetrate between the two mats, and then he utters in the clear, melodious singsong characteristic of magical incantations, what is perhaps the most important formula in the whole system of Omarakana garden magic, the vatuvi spell:

Formula 2

Thus in the hearing of all the ancestral spirits, the magician recites the long sacred spell over the axes. I have quoted it here in full, but without reproducing all the repetitions; for, especially in the middle part, the magician will repeat his assertions and exorcisms over and over again, “I blow off, I drive off, I sweep away” -- adding one pest, one blight, not always in the same order but somewhat at haphazard. The more important the occasion, the longer the repetitions. The spell here quoted will be recited as we shall see several times during the course of garden magic. When I listened to it in Bagido'u's hut, the proceedings took a good three-quarters of an hour, from the first exhortation to the spirits to the tying up of the magical virtue round the axe-blades, which ends the ritual.

There is no special taboo to be observed during this ritual. When I asked to be present my request was granted without further ado. The usual rule of good manners forbidding anyone to enter a house without very good reason, especially the house of a chief or garden magician, results in the spell being heard by a very small audience; but the rest of the villagers sitting outside over their festive meal of fish and taro pudding realise that it is being recited. As a matter of fact, since this spell is uttered in the usualloud singsong of magic, the immediate neighbours and all those who pass near the hut hear it.

The charm ended, the magician takes off the top mat and immediately proceeds to fasten the open flap of the leaf round each axe-blade. By this means the magical virtue becomes imprisoned round the blade. To keep it there even more safely, the top mat is carefully replaced so that it enfolds all the axes, which remain on a top bunk or shelf till the next morning.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual188,"First Grand Inaugural Act, Procession to Gardens","Early next morning all the men of the village again assemble in front of the magician's but, who, unable to sleep for the excitement of the occasion and the preparations before him, has himself risen very early. He has not yet touched food, however, for on this day he must observe fast until all the magical proceedings are over. Each man receives his axe and hangs it over his shoulder in the usual Trobriand fashion. Then the whole company, headed by the chief and the magician, march in Indian file slowly and with due solemnity to the gardens. They are in what might be called semifestive attire: an hibiscus flower or two in the hair, pandanus petals or green aromatic herbs in their armlets, black paint over one half of the face, or a few lines drawn with the crimson-red of crushed betel-nut mixed with lime. They have all washed at one of the water-holes and are anointed with coconut cream. They follow the road until they come to the point where a stile will lead over the fence into the garden -- a point which will be the centre of most magical activities throughout the cycle (see Pl. 31). So far, of course, there is no stile and no garden, and only the boundary belt cuts the road at this place. The magician now comes forward holding his kaylepa , which in Omarakana is a short stick without any special ornamentation, but sacied since it is the hereditary wand of office of the garden magician. Bagido'u takes this stick in his left hand and his axe in the right and steps into the near corner of the principal plot of the gardens, the one on the right nearest the village, and adjoining the village stile ( kalapisila o valu -- see Fig. 5). With a vigorous stroke he cuts down a small sapling; then lifts it in his right hand and recites over it and, as it were, into it, the following spell called kaygaga: 

Formula 3

The “bad wood”, the sapling over which the charm is spoken, is then thrown across the boundary belt into the yasewo , the uncut jungle. It stands for all the evil influences, but above all for the bush-pig. It conveys a magical message to them, as I was told (cf. Ch. III, Sec. 2).

Then Bagido'u cuts a sapling standing next to the first one, inserts this kayowota , as it is called, into the ground, and squats or rather sits down by it. This attitude has a ritual and mythological meaning. According to tradition, the Kaylu'ebila garden magic, the magic used in Omarakana, was originated by two women, Iyavata and Vikita (cf. above, M.F. 1). It is in their honour that Bagidc'u now rests on the ground female fashion. For no man ever sits with his buttocks on the ground, but has to squat without touching the soil.

The magician, swaying his whole body to right and left, and the stick with it, recites another short spell, the spell of kayowota : --

Formula 4

Without rising, the towosi tears up a handful of weeds and, while he rubs the ground with a swaying motion, he recites the yowota spell: --

Formula 5

This rite, which is described as talala , “we make to flower”, is meant to impart fertility to the soil and make the garden flourish with exubcrant crops. As Bagido'u put it to me (Text 41, Part V, Div. VIII, § 9): “After I rub the soil ritually, it becomes soft and fertile like the dumya .” As the kaygaga spell was negative, so this is the positive spell which will promote the growth of the gardens throughout the whole cycle. More specifically the planting of the yowota sapling has the effect of making the crops sprout and grow, and the rubbing of the ground makes it soft and good.

The ceremony is not quite at an end yet; Bagido'u rises to his feet and, with his magical wand, strikes the soil, saying the kaylepa spell: --

Formula 6

The men have been watching the ceremony in silence, standing in a close group on the small clearing which is always made at the kalapisila , on the road and on the boundary belt. After the magician has completed his share of the performance, they cease to be passive and, uttering the long-drawn scream, tilaykiki , each runs to his own garden plot, grasping his medicated-axe in his right hand. There the ceremony is repeated in miniature. The magician does not go with them, but his acolytes, his younger brothers and helpers follow the men. Each man cuts two sticks on his baleko . One he has to throw out of his baleko into the uncut bush, or, if his baleko does not adjoin this, carry it to the boundary belt and throw it across. The other, the kayowota , he plants in the ground. Afterwards he has to cut the little piece of scrub on that part of the baleko where later the kamkokola will be erected. Then one of the acolytes recites one formula only on each plot, the formula of yowota , rubbing the soil with weeds pulled out of the ground.

This compound ceremony inaugurates the cutting of the scrub, to which the men now proceed energetically; the work is done in part communally and in part individually, each man on his own plot (cf. Ch. IV, Sec. 5).",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual189,"Second Grand Inaugural Act, Days 1 and 2","The Second Grand Inaugural Act: The Ritual Burning of the Gardens

This complex set of gardening activities, to which we shall return presently, is inaugurated by a four-fold magical ceremony. At this point the practical and magical activities are perhaps more intimately associated and intertwined with one another than at any other stage.

The wholesale burning is itself a magical act performed by the magician and his helpers on the first day of the ceremonial series. On the second day, the magician ritually starts the practically more effective second burning of the small weeds and accumulated refuse. On the third and fourth days he performs ceremonies which consist of a magical planting of tare and yams respectively. Thus each of the four inaugural rites of magic is correlated with one or the other aspect of the complex activities on which the gardeners now embark.

At this time of the year fine weather may generally be expected to last; for we are in the middle of the dry season of the south-east trade winds. Bagido'u, with his fine meteorological appreciation, decides on a date that will allow him to expect a run of a few fine days, a desirable though not indispensable condition. Then, one evening, he will address the village:

“To-morrow I put the kaboma (garden taboo) on our fields. You remain in the village; I with my younger brothers will go and make the wholesale burning ( vakavayla'u ). You remain in the village. Do not do any garden work. Just remain and rest. I shall go, I shall burn the garden.”

Next morning Bagido'u will produce some magical torches, kaykapola , from one of the shelves which run under the thatch of his roof. Enfolded in a mat, these have been lying there since the last harvest a few months before. At that time he prepared them for the present occasion, charming them over with a spell which we know already -- the long spell beginning with the words: Vatuvi, vatuvi -- “Show the way, show the way.” He takes the mat with the torches inside it and, escorted by some of his acolytes, repairs to the garden.

When I accompanied Bagido'u on the vakavayla'u ceremony of September 11th, 1915, the chief himself went with us, rather in attendance on me than on the garden, I suspect. The chief's eldest wife, Bokuyoba, came also, and about half a dozen men, among them Towese'i and Mitakata, the two younger blood-brothers of Bagido'u. Elsewhere, at one or two other ceremonies of this kind, I saw the garden magician in company with two or three men who were helping him. At my first vakavayla'u , the chief, To'uluwa, himself took one torch, his eldest wife another, Molubabeba, the chief's maternal first cousin, another, Bagido'u yet another and, standing to the windward of the garden, they applied the torehes simultaneously to the cut scrub (Pl. 34. See also Pl. 29). It was dry and blazed away easily. After the fire was under way, Towese'i and Mitakata took a torch each and went round the boundary belt kindling the cut scrub at intervals, at least once on each garden plot. In Omarakana, in spite of all the greatness of its magic and dignity of the ritual, an ordinary match-box was produced in the gardens, from which the torches were lit. In some other villages, however, the fire has to be either made by friction in the garden, or carried from the village by means of fire-sticks lit at the magician's hearth.

On our return to the village, we observe that a somewhat festive though by no means highly ceremonial or religious atmosphere prevails; the majority of the people have remained there, for the most part just sitting about and chatting. There is no taboo on attendance at such ceremonies -- even women may be present, as we have seen, and may handle the magical torches -- but naturally only those specially authorised to go would be there.

But though this ceremony has few trappings, it is regarded as very sacred and important, indeed indispensable. On one occasion -- it was I think some ten years before my arrival in the islands -- one of the resident magistrates, not aware of the necessity for magical burning, was tempted, in passing a cut and dried garden, to put a match to it. It was in a specially dry year, he told me, and the bush had been very tall and rank, so that the idea of a gigantic bonfire attracted him. He lit the garden, and soon the night was ablaze with high-towering flames. In a few minutes he was surrounded by a crowd of natives, half despairing, half angry, who then explained to him for the first time their magical theory of gardening, besought him never to do anything of this sort again, and prophesied that the gardens would suffer. And indeed this was a year of drought -- hence the beauty of the bonfire -- so that the prophecy did come true, and the white man for once contributed by his act to the strengthening of native belief. For although this occurred years before I came to the Trobriands and in an entirely different district, the natives of Omarakana would quote this case to me as proof of the truth of their doctrine and of the danger of European interference with their custom.

Back in his house, Bagido'u sits down with his assistants and eats his first meal for that day. Soon after, he proceeds to the preparation of the next act in the sequence: the second burning, called gibuviyaka , literally “the big burning”, though in fact it is a burning carried out in detail. He goes out in search of two kinds of leaves: to the seashore for acacia leaves ( vayoulo ), and afterwards to the swampy marches, to the dumya , for lalang grass ( gipware'i ). Some time before, a few budding coconut sprouts have been cut and have by now dried, thus yielding the easily inflammable material of the torches.

Next morning the magician places the acacia leaves, the lalang grass and the torches beside each other on one mat, covering this with another. A piece of dried banana leaf is tied round the end of each torch by means of some lalang grass, leaving a flap open which is not folded over and tied down until after the spell has been spoken. The procedure is similar to that used with the axes (cf. Ch. II, Sec. 4). The function of the leaf is to catch and imprison the magical virtue of the spell. The spell recited over the torches and acacia leaves is again the vstuwi (M.F. 2 of our series).

Immediately after this spell has been recited, the magician and his acolytes set out for the gardens to carry out the actual rite of gibuviyaka . On the occasion on which I saw and photographed the rite, Bagido'u personally performed it only on the leywota . His younger brother Mitakata, accompanied by Molubabeba (a Tabalu), Gumguya'u and Ka'ututa'u, ritually carried out the two-fold ceremony on all the other plots.

They carried the acacia leaves, which had been tied with lalang grass into as many bundles as there were plots and wrapped up in a large folded mat. They went first to the leywota . There the assistants quickly performed a sort of preliminary koumwala , gathering sticks, weeds and branches and piling these in front of Bagido'u. Bagido'u took a bundle of acacia leaves out of the mat, and put it into the heap. After the leywota , Mitakata performed the ceremony on the other baleko (Pl. 35; cf. also Pl. 33). The heaps are called lumlum , a word to my knowledge used only with reference to these magical piles.

After his return Bagido'u cannot yet sit down to his morning meal. He is once more called by his duties to the garden. Accompanied again by one or two helpers, who this time carry a mat full of medicated torches, he goes back to the leywota . With no preliminary spell, he lights the torch by means of a match and sets fire to the lumlum , and again the ceremony is performed on the other plots by Mitakata. Returning to the village in the afternoon, he can break his fast; this ends the second day's ceremonies, which are to be continued on the morrow.

[...]

These four rites, that is to say, the rite of the second, that of the third, and the two rites of the fourth day, should be performed on every garden plot. When I watched them in Omarakana, the master magician, Bagido'u, was seriously ill and every effort tired him, so that he only did the rites on one or two plots. I think actually the gibuviyaka was done on all the six leywota , but the planting rites only on one plot. The remaining plots were dealt with by his younger brothers. In other villages, however, the garden magician would personally officiate on every baleko and the whole thing would not take long, because the spells are very short and the rites simple.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual190,"Second Grand Inaugural Act, Day 3","The rite of the third day, called by the strange name pelaka'ukwa (lit. “dog's excrement”), consists in the planting of a taro. Bagido'u goes to the leywota , accompanied by helpers who carry large bunches of taro tops; that is, of taro leaves attached to the top of the root from which the edible bulbous part has been cut off. It is by putting such a taro top into the soil that this vegetable is planted (cf. Ch. X, Sec. 2). He takes the biggest and most promising taro top and, holding it in his right hand, puts his face close to the cut surface and speaks into it the following charm: --

Formula 7

In comparing this with the spell of the bad stick (M.F. 3) we see that they are identical, save for the first line. Also, by the magical tradition of Omarakana, this spell is spoken in a soft persuasive voice into the cut surface of the taro, and not chanted.

This ritual taro is planted in the corner of the leywota which adjoins the “stile of the village side” -- the corner which will gradually become the main “magical corner” of the gardens (Pls. 23 and 31).

The magician's younger brothers now proceed to all the other garden plots, and repeat the ceremony.

These four rites, that is to say, the rite of the second, that of the third, and the two rites of the fourth day, should be performed on every garden plot. When I watched them in Omarakana, the master magician, Bagido'u, was seriously ill and every effort tired him, so that he only did the rites on one or two plots. I think actually the gibuviyaka was done on all the six leywota , but the planting rites only on one plot. The remaining plots were dealt with by his younger brothers.

Ritual191,"Second Grand Inaugural Act, Day 4","On the fourth day a double rite is performed exactly on the spot where the first taro has been planted on the previous day. In the first of these rites, which is called kalimamata , a seed tuber of a special variety of yam, called kwanada , is planted. Bagido'u again squats down at the magical corner. He takes the kwanada tuber in his right hand, holds it close to his mouth and speaks the following spell into it: --

Formula 8This short spell is spoken, not in the soft persuasive voice, but loudly as if giving a peremptory order or perhaps inciting to some decisive action. The spell is obviously an exhortation to the vegetables to grow and spread on both sides of the garden.

Immediately after this, the garden magician takes a taro top from one of his assistants and chants it over, this time in the ordinary singsong of magical formulae: --

Formula 9The words of the spell explain the intention of the rite, which is to make the taro grow in size and in quality.

After the spell, Bagido'u performs this rite: he collects a few small twigs, some twenty to forty inches long, and constructs or rather sketcnes out a miniature hut: he plants four verticals, with forks at the top into which he then places four horizontals, and these he covers with a little sketchy roof by laying a number of horizontal sticks across the top rectangle. This miniature hut he surrounds with a miniature fence, made by planting a few forked sticks and placing horizontals on them.

The whole construction is called si bwala baloma , the spirits' house. Bagido'u could not explain to me the meaning of it. He was quite clear, however, that the spirits had really nothing to do with it, for, as he told me, the milamala festival is over and the spirits have returned to the spirit-land, Tuma. 1 But he little erection is supposed in some way to make the future fence strong and effective. The whole ceremony of planting the second taro and constructing the spirits' house is called bisikola .

These four rites, that is to say, the rite of the second, that of the third, and the two rites of the fourth day, should be performed on every garden plot.

After the fourth day the taboo on work is lifted, and each man with his family goes to his own plot and carries on with the cleaning ( koumnwala ) and the planting ( sopu ).",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual192,"Funeral, Phase 1","Phase 1: Yawari (Crying)

It is a truism that sound, for example, speech, provides a very efficient means of communication. Even the absence of certain sounds can be effective. The sounds that fill a village at particular times during a normal day provide information about the well-being of life in general. The natural sounds of leaves rustling as trees and palms sway under a gentle breeze are almost unnoticed. And the music of the birds as they call to each other or complain about an intrusion is only momentarily acknowledged and only then to confirm normality. The incessant grunting of pigs together with the cackling of domestic chickens provides the background noise to the sounds of humans going about their daily tasks. Imagine this orchestration of sound and hear the laughter of children playing while men and women chatter away, some in animated discourse, others in hushed tones of secrecy. Suddenly a scream intrudes upon life's symphony: the ritualized mourning cry takes up the traditional tempo and announces a death in the village. Normal life stops as everyone is summoned to participate in some way in the mourning of the newly deceased among them.

The sorrowful cry of those close to the dying, following immediately upon the death of the loved one, communicates most effectively to the rest of the village the loss of one of their members. That single, ritualized cry of anguish heralds the onset of yet another cycle of mortuary ceremonies and exchanges to honor the newly deceased. These ceremonies enmesh every individual in the Vakutan community, consisting of four interrelated villages. Individuals from other villages on Kiriwina, Kitava, and Dobu islands who had relationships with the deceased may also become involved. All stop whatever task they are engaged in and embark upon a series of activities that identifies their past relationship with the deceased.

Uterine kin of the deceased's spouse and father become the mourners. They go directly to the house where the corpse lies, enter, and proceed to mourn actively through ritualized crying. Although the cries follow a well established pattern, the real sorrow is no less diminished. Women make up the majority of mourners in the house. Only men who have direct blood ties with the deceased's spouse and father enter and participate in this form of active mourning, which is called yawari (crying). Other men remain outside the house, listening in silence to the sorrowful wail emitting from the house (Table 1).

Conspicuously absent from the house in which their dead kin lies among prostrate, wailing figures are the uterine kin of the deceased. All people of the same clan, and particularly of the same dala , try to maintain a grieved but controlled manner. They do not enter the house to participate in mourning activity. Some enter occasionally to oversee the proceedings, take refreshment to the mourners, or take note of who is mourning for their dead kin. When I asked why those, who to our minds would be most emotionally affected were in fact retaining a degree of decorum, I was told that they cannot afford to express their sadness and mourn their dead: “They feel very sad for the death of their kin, but they have much work to do, they must cook for those who mourn their dead kin, and they must make plans for the mortuary distributions” (Kunabu, Vakuta village; see also Malinowski 1929:127-29). Although the kin are not allowed to join the ritual mourning of their dead kin, they move with red-rimmed eyes around the outside of the house, carrying out the various chores to be done while the chorus of cries, rising and falling in intensity, issues from the house. The atmosphere is very tense for those outside who are trying to maintain control over any direct display of emotion. While the village is divided between those who go about the business of mourning, and those preparing food for the mourners, a few young men who are not kin to the deceased dig the grave and prepare the coffin. They also remove hair or fingernails from the corpse. These relics are woven into a necklace called mwagula and worn by a close affine of the dead person. He or she who puts on the mourning necklace becomes the principal mourner for the deceased. It is because of mwagula that the kin of the deceased must perform all the stages in the mortuary cycle, particularly those in the third phase. Until all the remains of their dead kinsman or woman are buried, the deceased's kinsmen are obliged to maintain a demanding exchange relationship with the wearer of the mourning necklace and her or his kin. The exchange is demanding because they must amass great amounts of wealth in the form of yams, coconuts, betel nut, pigs, skirts, and Kula shell valuables. These they must periodically give to the wearer of the mourning necklace and her or his kin in exchange for their mourning activity and for care of the remains of the deceased. The spouse or father (depending upon whether the deceased is married or not) has the right to wear the mourning necklace. If the deceased's spouse or father is too old, the primary mourning responsibilities will be taken on by a close relative of the spouse or father such as a daughter, son, brother, or sister.

When burial is imminent, all the personal belongings of the deceased are put into the coffin with the body. Many of these articles will be removed again before interment (cf. Malinowski 1922:512-13). Bobwailila (gifts) are also put into the coffin by friends and affines and removed before burial. These are gifts denoting love and affection for the deceased by people not in a kinship relationship to her or him. The gifts consist of valuables and may include Kula shell valuables. The deceased's kin will remove what they want prior to burial. Careful note is taken of who gave gifts so that those who contribute bobwailila are repaid at a later date.

The climax of yawari involves the final parting as the corpse is interred. All but the remains that are worn around the neck of the principal mourner are buried. It is at this point that emotions reach a climax. As the pallbearers attempt to lower the corpse into the coffin, and then the coffin into the grave, people violently try to prevent it. The most overtly violent are close kin of the principal mourner. Hands snatch at the corpse as it is lowered into the coffin. Other people must be restrained from jumping into the grave or from preventing the coffin's progress as it is lowered into the grave. The emotion that swells the already heavy atmosphere at the grave site turns into hysteria as villagers catch their last glimpse of the corpse. Resigned sobbing follows as the falling earth resounds loudly, resonating with each heavy thud on the lid of the coffin as it lies in the grave. The yawari finishes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual193,"Funeral, Phase 2","Phase 2: Vakakaiya (Bathing)

The preceding stages occur within a few days following a death. They have as their principal aim the return to normal village life. Throughout this period the principal mourner has maintained close association with the deceased by adopting many deathlike characteristics. It now remains to readmit the principal mourner to society. The next set of mortuary distributions places an emphasis on the gradual shedding of the restrictions on the principal mourner, which symbolize less an association with death than a denial of certain pleasures symbolic of one's sorrow at the loss of a loved one. These restrictions include kawagala , a prohibition on eating yams, taro, and ripe bananas; saigala , the wearing of dark unattractive clothes, growing a beard, not combing one's hair, together with a general neglect of one's appearance; and finally vaigula , a prohibition on remarriage and the pursuit of sexual partners (Table 2).

At some time following a death the principal mourner's clanswomen gather at the house of the principal mourner's dala head to make a saipwala. A saipwala is a special skirt made of undyed banana leaf strands prepared in the same way as the dubalela (underskirt) of debumwoya skirts. The fibers in the saipwala , however, are joined together to make a skirt five or six times longer than a debumwoya (normal skirt). This stage is called saipwala ivatusi (they bind together the saipwala ). The purpose is to solicit the vakakaiya ceremony. The women are given cooked and uncooked food by their kinsmen to distribute as kaimelu (payment) for their work on the saipwala .

When completed, the saipwala is given to the torikariga , who houses it until his clanswomen (women of the same dala /clan of the deceased) gather to dismantle it. This is called biritutulasi saipwala and occurs several weeks after the saipwala has been presented to the kariga clan. The skirt is taken apart from the bottom up, until the skirt is a suitable length, with the hemline falling almost to the ground. The woman who receives it is either the principal mourner herself or the sister or daughter of a male principal mourner. The individual bands of the skirt, separated from the main skirt, are distributed among the kariga clan women. Those who receive a band must make a skirt to give at the vakakaiya ceremony that follows several months later. The women are again given payment in the form of kaimelu (cooked and uncooked food) by their clansmen.

Like the clanswomen of the principal mourner, her or his clansmen must also perform certain tasks to solicit ceremonies designed to remove particular restrictions. Kawasa is the cooking of mona (taro pudding: a special food made of beaten taro and coconut cream) and the giving of this pudding to the kariga clan to distribute among themselves. The purpose is to induce the kariga clan to perform ulusila wadola (discussed later) on the principal mourner.

Some time after the cooking of taro pudding, the kariga clansmen repay the principal mourner's clansmen by collectively cooking taro pudding and returning it to them. This is simply called mapula kawasa . After these preliminary activities the stage is set for ulusila wadola and vakakaiya , the lifting of the final restriction on the principal mourner.

The offering of ulusila wadola , (yam pudding) to the principal mourner is a symbolic reintroduction of “proper” food to her or his diet. The yam pudding is called toamata . It is of interest to compare toamata with the noun for corpse, tomata ( to- is the masculine prefix; -mata means to go out, to be extinguished as a flame or fire). The pale yellow color of the yam pudding is likened to the pallor of a corpse. It is this pudding that the principal mourner is to eat. (See also the essay by Montague in this volume.) Ideologically the most onerous restriction assumed by the principal mourner is the denial of “good” food such as yams, taro, and ripe bananas. With the performance of ulusila wadola this restriction is removed. In eating toamata , the principal mourner internalizes her or his close association with the deceased, thus allowing the external being of the principal mourner, which has remained visually associated with the deceased since death, to begin the process of returning to the living. The kariga clan head makes the toamata and with the help of other kinsmen tries to persuade the mourner to eat it. It is not an easy task to convince the mourner to resume eating yams again, thereby internalizing his grief. One man mourning the loss of his son resisted three attempts by his wife's kinsmen to persuade him to accept the toamata . He was still refusing yams when I left the village. If the mourner refuses the toamata , it is simply reintroduced at a later date until she or he accepts the spoon of yam pudding and thus sheds another restriction ( kawagala ).

The final ceremony in the second phase of the mortuary cycle is vakakaiya , and it corresponds roughly to the final stage in northern Kiriwina called lisaladabu (Weiner 1976:62). As in northern Kiriwina the purpose of the vakakaiya ceremony is to release the principal mourner and others who have elected to take on the saigala restriction from further restrictive mourning. Saigala is the deliberate neglect of one's appearance. The vakakaiya ceremony is also designed to pay back all those who wore kuwa (a thin black band around the upper arm or neck). The principal mourner, however, retains his or her mourning necklace.

The participants, comprising the men and women of the kariga clan together with the mourning clan and anyone else who wishes to attend, gather at the house where the principal mourner has resided throughout her or his mourning (usually the torikariga 's house). The kariga clanswomen bring skirts, and the men bring material, valuables, and money to distribute to the mourning clan. The women commence the proceedings by allocating skirts for distribution to the various mourners who accepted behaviors and work associated with mourning: those who deliberately neglected their appearance, those who adorned themselves with kuwa , women who prepared the saipwala skirt, and the principal mourner who wears the mwagula . The men busy themselves with the distribution of their valuables to saigala wearers. While this is going on outside the torikariga 's house, the principal mourner remains inside, helped by other mourners of her or his dala and clan. They commence the ritual cry, reminding everyone of the loss of a relative and friend. It is the job of the deceased's clanswomen to end the “crying” and recurring mourning of the deceased by bathing the principal mourner and dressing her or him in clothes symbolizing the new status of the mourner. Once the skirts are satisfactorily distributed by kariga women outside the house they enter the house to join the principal mourner. With them they take a prepared mixture of scraped coconut and scented herbs. This they rub onto the skins of the principal mourner and her or his helpers. In this way they are ritually “bathed” and the external signs of mourning removed. Kuwa are cut off and new skirts given to the principal mourner. If the latter is a woman a new, bright-red skirt is put on and cut short: the attire of a sexually available female. If the mourner is a man, a new cloth is tied around his loins by kariga dala men, and he is given a razor with which to shave his beard. Symbolically, the mourners are cleansed of their closeness to death. They are entreated to rejoin the society of the living and to prepare themselves for the reemergence of their sexuality. This ends the actual vakakaiya . Everyone gathers outside the house to partake of the cooked food prepared by the wives of the kariga dala /clan men. Uncooked vegetables are distributed to the kariga dala /clan women by their kinsmen in payment for their work in preparing the skirts and doing the work of the preceding mortuary ceremonies.

The completion of the vakakaiya ceremony marks a structural break in the mortuary cycle as a whole; all mortuary ceremonies that have been concerned with an individual's death are now finished. Village life for everyone returns to normal and the two individuals for whom all the preceding ceremonies have been conducted are freed of most of their responsibilities to each other; one may rest in peace, temporarily separated from living society, while the other rejoins it. The two are freed, however, only from the central stage of village life. They must reemerge together at a later date when the mwagula (mourning necklace), which still binds them together, is laid to rest at the grave site.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual194,Mampapotanoana,"Mampapotanoana

The most important ritual performed for young children was the mampapotanoana . Although it did not constitute an initiation in the usual sense of the term it did mark in a way a first stage in the child’s progress toward becoming a full-fledged human being and member of the community, and is therefore included in this section.

It was performed for all children before they were a year old. Most people said it was done when a child first laughed. It was also done if a child cried or was sick often, and some waited for a large powurake for curing the sick, when it could be done at less expense.

The name itself means “to provide with tanoana ” . Various reasons were given for it. An infant’s tanoana, it seemed, was only loosely attached to him and could easily go astray or be taken from him, for example by an eagle ( kuajangi ) who would take it to the wurake . Because a child’s tanoana was uncontrolled it had to be protected by a wurake: “The name of a wurake must be hung on the child.” It was also said that a child’s tanoana had to be securely tied to him, or that the ceremony was performed to make his legs strong. Some thought it could be held for several babies at a time, others not, as they would fight for the tanoana among themselves and the strongest would get the most, which would shorten the livens of the rest (II, 411f.).

The first thing the shaman did was to apply medicine to the infant’s body and massage it, supposedly to remove anything which could prevent the tanoana from entering it. She then prepared a small basket with rice, egg, sirih-pinang, sometimes cigarettes and a string of large beads. It was wrapped about with a piece of fringed bark cloth decorated with black and yellow strips. The basket was covered with bark cloth. Then she tore a strip of bark cloth from a sheet of it and a strip of cordyline from a leaf, counted them off one to five, and tied them together at one end. Next she described a circle with the basket over the child while counting from one to five, chewed a piece of medicine, laid a second piece on a piece of bark cloth, put it and the above-mentioned strips lengthwise on the child’s body and cut the strips off by its mouth, saying: “My child, just as I cut the cordyline and the bark cloth, so will your speech appear; you will call your father and mother and speak of grandfather and grandmother.” The pieces of bark cloth and cordyline were put in the basket. She then waved the basket again in a circle over the child’s head, counting up to five, and said, “My child, cry no more; if the wurake of your grandmother is poking you, let it stop poking you; or if you’re crying for your tanoana, I’m going now to get it.” Next she struck the child five times on the crown with a bunch of cordyline, shaking the leaves into the basket each time. The basket she put beside her in the pelawo during the recital of her litany. A piece of the cordyline was later planted “so that the child will flourish just like the cordyline.”

In the litany which followed the shaman described her efforts to get tanoana for the child. The places where she sought it varied from tribe to tribe or region to region. Kruyt said that the shamans always sought it everywhere and in the largest possible quantities, and this would seem to have been true for the tribes around the Lake, where it was taken from the ancestors, i Manta’a tau (Pue mpalaburu) and from two birds, Tolelengkidji (Tolelengkii) and Tolelengkaa, who stole the tanoana of little children. It was apparently not the case, however, in other places. Thus in an account not attributed to any one tribe or district the shaman was said to have to get the tanoana belonging to the particular child from Pue di songi, otherwise it would never become a vigorous person. The To Wingke-mposo took the tanoana of an old To Kinadu, so that the child would live as long as its former owner. The To Pebato shamans, finally, stole it from the mouth of Pue mpalaburu.

The litany for this occasion being shorter than usual, it was finished in the middle of the night. The shaman, therefore, slept till dawn, when she applied the tanoana acquired to the child. The mother held the child on her lap, facing east, and the shaman placed the cordyline on its head several times and also on that of the mother and others present who did not feel well and wished to profit from the occasion. She also shook corn silk and similar objects over its head, applied rice and medicine to it and medicine to its hands and feet and asked the tanoana to stay with the child and not listen to the calls of the child’s dead relatives. Beads and feathers were also fixed to its hair. A woka was made and hung from the roof of the house with the idea that a wurake would come to live in it and look after the child (II, 151ff.).

Another ceremony, mo’ojuti, “to tie something to something”, supposedly followed the mampapotanoana at an indefinite interval. At it the spirit ( lamoa ) of the grandmother was said to be attached to the child, but Kruyt could find out little about it. It may have been a preliminary to or equivalent of the girls’ initiation ( momparilangka ) (II, 156; Wdb., 514n.).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual195,Momparilangka,"Momparilangka

Similar to the head-hunting ritual, in many respects was the momparilangka or mompakawurake, an initiation ceremony for girls. According to the first edition the first of these names was used by the western tribes and the second by the eastern ones (1912: I, 365). It took place every three to five years (Kruyt, 1935b: 550), and though no special time of year is mentioned it would seem safe to assume that it fell in the slack period between harvest and planting, because of the extensive preparations it required and its duration. The best day for it was determined by listening to the call of the powiwi or mamboi bird (1912: I, 365).

The ceremonies were performed either in the temple, as was the case with the western tribes, of which the To Pebato and To Wingke-mposo were the principal, or in a special hut ( bantaja ), which the eastern tribes, principally the To Lage and To Onda’e, erected for the occasion. The To Palande and To Lamusa, on the other hand, used the temple if they had one in the village or built a hut if they didn’t. This distinction between the eastern and western tribes, incidentally, was reversed with respect to the funeral ceremonies ( motengke, mompemate ) (II, 87).

All girls, both slave and free, were expected to have participated at some time or other, usually somewhere between the ages of 3 and 14. Sometimes it was done younger, but then by proxy, and sometimes a girl was older, if her family hadn’t been able to afford it earlier. Some women took part twice, once as a child and once again later on if they decided to become a shaman, though this was not necessary, and it was sometimes repeated for a child who remained sickly after the first time. No one, however, ever participated more than twice. If a girl did it for a second time she did not enter the enclosure ( langka mpealo-alo ), but just put her clothes in it, though she took part in the rest of the activities. Girls from other villages of the same tribe could participate, and this was done if there were too few of them in their own villages to justify putting on a momparilangka there or if a child had remained sickly and it was felt desirable to repeat the ceremony.

Only those boys who showed a definite tendency to act like girls and who were thus destined to become beli later on took part. A man who first later in life decided to become one did not undergo the initiation. Sometimes men suffering from leprosy or rheumatoid arthritis participated in hopes of being cured. Childless women also did so sometimes for a second time in order to get children. (II, 85f.).

The momparilangka was directed by a head shaman, assisted by a few colleagues. Each of these, who in this function were called tombonua, had charge of three or four, sometimes as many as five pupils (II, 86).

The duration of the ceremonies depended on where they were performed; if they were held in the temple (as by the western tribes) they lasted seven days, if in a hut (as by the eastern tribes), three days. (II, 87). They were sometimes prolonged, however, if there were too many candidates for the number of shamans available (ibid., 86).

The momparilangka required the most extensive preparations of all the Toradja feasts. The shamans spent days painting bark cloth head-cloths and bands and collecting various herbs; large quantities of pinang blossoms and nuts had to be gathered, and many small knives, hatchets and spearpoints had to be made as well as six to ten swords with fancy scabbards. White cotton and bark cloth, baskets and mats, sun hats (tinii, sorue), cordyline, palm wine, a pig for each girl participating, rice, beads, copper rings and bells were also necessary. (ibid., 88f.).

An enclosure, the langka mpealo-alo was set up in the center of the temple or hut. A framework with a raised floor was erected of yellow bamboo or sometimes of sugar cane. A small chopping-knife and needle were placed in each bamboo and a white cotton cloth was hung over the framework to form the walls and ceiling. The resulting construction was usually about three meters square. It corresponded to the sack (pelawo) into which the shaman crept to recite her litany. Around the enclosure a frame was made of four heavy planks standing on their long sides, the ends of which were carved to resemble the heads of hornbills (alo), which gave them their name of dopi mpealo-alo . These planks were furthermore painted with figures of snakes, supposedly representing the ule alo, the ancestral snake which lived in the temple. The dopi mpealo-alo were stored in the roof of the temple between ceremonies. When new ones were necessary only a head-hunting leader could cut down the true for them and they could be worked only by men who had invoked the ancestors in the temple ( mesomba ). The enclosure was decorated with strips of colored bark cloth, young arenga leaves, inflorescences of pinang and coconut and sprigs of various herbs. The posts were wound with cordyline and behung with swords, spears and shamans’ hats. From the roof were hung a couple of bamboo racks on which were laid sticks with pieces of iron tied to them, one stick for each girl within the enclosure ( pasoda labu, “place where one hangs up the iron”). In Onda’e and Lage wooden birds were hung from the framework called Tokajugundu, “inhabitant of the thunder-tree” and Tokaju-luntu, “inhabitant of the tree which rises above all other trees”. The full name of the first tree was Kaju-gundu-sangka-langi, “tree which thunders across the heavens” (Wdb.). It was a waringin which supposedly stood next to the former village of Lepati (referred to as Mungku Maragi, “colorful mountain” in a litany) in Lage (Wdb.; II, 91).

In contrast to the langka mpealo-alo the remainder of the floor of the temple or hut and any extensions built on to it were called lando (this word was also used in land lando, buffalo pasture (II, 89ff.; Wdb.) 11 .

The girls assembled in the hut or temple toward noon of the first day, and after having been washed with coconut milk or water from special receptacles, according to the custom of the tribe in question, they were dressed by their leaders in white bark cloth clothes which were painted with red and yellow figures .

Once dressed the girls lined up and followed the head shaman, who danced the motaro with a ceremonial spear ( lipongi ) in her hand, seven times around the langka mpealo-clo . Each girl held a branch of cordyline in her hand with which she struck the person in front of her. Then each one was counted off and shown her place in the enclosure by her leader: “So and so shall not experience any ill effects from climbing up into the langka; her life will be vigorous, because she is being installed today in the langka; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.” After all the girls had gone inside the curtain two of the shamans danced ( motaro ) around the langka to prevent evil spirits from entering it. A pig and a fowl were then brought in and carried seven times around the enclosure. Then they were slaughtered and each of the girls was touched on the cheek with their blood. Finally two shamans passed among the girls with their spears, which each girl had to touch, and then danced ( motaro ) once again seven times around the langka . During all these activities the karatu drum was beaten constantly (II, 91ff.).

The floor of the langka mpealo-alo was thickly covered with sleeping mats and each girl was seated upon an object called empehi, which consisted of a miniature rain mat in which were wrapped a hatchet, a knife, a needle, bark cloth and cotton cloth, a small bamboo drinking cup, four areca nuts, seven cigarettes, cordyline and various other herbs. Once inside the enclosure the girls had to remain there for the duration of the ritual, except for the performance of a few shamanistic activities under the guidance of their leaders. They urinated through the cracks in the floor, and for purposes of defecation a covered platform about ten meters long was usually built out from the temple. The girls were accompanied by their leaders to the end of the platform, where they relieved themselves, to protect them from assault by the evil forces in the sky in the form of two great birds, tolelengkaa and tolelengkidji (which we have already come across in connection with the mampapotanoana ) or toea (another term for kongka, “kite”). The girls ate as little as possible and drank only palm wine to check the working of the bowels, though supposedly one who really had the call to be a shaman felt not the slightest need to defecate (ibid., 93ff.).

It is not possible on the basis of Kruyt’s material to give a consecutive account throughout of the momparilangka nor to distinguish except in one instance between the ceremony as performed in hut or temple. It may be broken down, however, into daily activities and those of single occurrence. Each morning and evening the girls were trained in the shamans dance ( motaro ) by their leaders, who led them in it around the langka, and in dancing over a series of mats ( molontjo ali ) in preparation for the molontjo wawu of the final day. At dawn and at sunset every day they performed the mongkabe[unknown] o, “to beckon the sun to oneself”. The girls assembled outside the langka, in the morning to the cast of it and in the evening to the west of it. Each held a piece of bamboo to which a cordyline leaf and a woman’s jacket had been attached. The shamans recited seven strophes of their litany concerning the rising and setting of the sun to the accompaniment of the karatu drum, and at a given moment the girls began to beckon to the sun with their bamboo sticks while the shamans grasped their spears and thrust them toward the sun. The mongkabe eo was supposedly done “in order that the sun come quickly to the zenith; in order that it set successfully after the completion of its daily task.” The beckoning of the sun was “to rouse the desire to perform the shamans’ dance ( motaro ) so that the people will play,” and the thrusting toward it was “to arouse the desire to fight so that the enemy shall not conquer these companions of the wurake who have mounted to the sky.” In Pebato the shaman beckoned the sun into a bowl, and the ceremony was there called “to catch the sun” ( manland[unknown] ando ). At some time or other during the momparilangka each girl was given a spiritual husband, presumably a wurake . They could be seen during the mongkabe eo holding a sham fight in the sun (ibid., O8f.).

The mornings were spent making various things necessary for the performance of shamanistic duties and painting clothes to be worn on the final day. These included the shaman’s medicine pouch, bark cloth girdles and the rare (ibid., 99ff.).

The nights were spent in reciting litanies, though Kruyt did not give much information on this point. Some people said the shamans did this to train the girls, whereas others claimed they did it to give the impression that the girls themselves were doing it and had thus already become full-fledged shamans. At any rate each girl was taken under the pelavo by a shaman for instruction, which she paid for with a piece of white cotton, a dark shoulder cloth, a brass bracelet, a string of beads and a sword (ibid., 95).

One of the litanies concerned the mooko lipu, “to erect a village”. The houses of the warake, namely, were thought to suffer frequently from floods, so the shamans and their pupils mounted en masse to the sky to assist them in restoring one of their villages in return for their help. On this occasion the girls were taught how to make the miniature houses ( woka ) the shamans made when curing their patients. Once this was over the so-called mooko lipu tanoana mpae (also mooko lipu raon according to the Wdb.) was performed in order, said Kruyt, to bring the life spirit of the rice down to earth from heaven. This apparently consisted in raising up and down a basket, in which were placed three bunches of cordyline whose stems were wrapped in bark cloth, to the accompaniment of an unspecified litany (ibid., p. 95ff.).

The shamans also performed the mampu'a nukolu “to make the knees bend”, on the girls. This was curative ritual used on sick children of both sexes. The girl straddled the above-mentioned empehi . The shaman squatted beside her, counted up to seven and seized her by the lower part of her legs, so that she came to sit on the empehi . The shaman then picked at the back of her head with the point of a sword to remove the disease, while reciting a litany (ibid., 95f, 169).

Among the To Lage and To Onda’e the second night was of particular importance (the ceremonies lasted three days there), as the dimalcle , evil spirits of the upperworld, came to attack the people. Every one returned to the village from the field huts, all doors and windows were closed and swords and spears were tied to the door posts. Most of the villagers came together in the feast hut, where they first shared a meal with the dead ( angga ntan mate ) and the gods ( lamoa ). After this the shamans, supported by all present, waged a dramatic battle with the evil spirits. It was concluded by a brief version of the head-hunters’ feast ( mompeleleka ) (II, 101f.).

On the final day the girls dressed up in special clothes and were ceremonially bathed, anointed and sprinkled with coconut milk. Then an oracle was performed on each girl with two halves of a coconut to see if her trip to the spirits had turned out well for her. Next an oracle was carried out with a rooster to see if any of the girls would become a shaman.

These ceremonies took most of the morning. Toward noon the girls danced ( motaro ) seven times around the langka mpealo-alo and left the hut or temple by the east door. Before they set foot on the ground their feet were counted off from one to seven. They then proceeded to a spot where a number of pigs (the number varied from tribe to tribe) were laid in a row on the ground about seventy centimeters apart with their heads pointing toward the temple or hut. The head shaman, holding spear and sword, danced seven times in both directions over the pigs, followed by the girls. When each girl had finished the shaman pretended to pick something out of her with her knife. While this was going on a man held a battle dance around the pigs. The whole ceremony was called molontju wawu, “to run over pigs”. The pigs were finally slaughtered and everybody present was touched with their blood on the cheek or forehead (II, 104ff.).

Once this was over every one headed for the river. A man performed a war dance around the girls on the way and the shamans recited part of their litanies. A spot was chosen by the river where a pokae tree grew. If there was none one was transplanted from elsewhere). It was called in this case kaju tonanda, “three which observes”. The shamans and girls approached the tree with white bowls containing sirih-pinang, beads and tobacco, stuck their knives in the ground around it, which had been cleared of weeds, hung their hats on it and sat down under it. The shamans then addressed seven gods and spirits: the wurake, To Palemboadi (nowhere else mentioned), the anitu ri lobo, the lamoa nawu, the sobugo, the anitu ri kolowo and Pue mpalaburu. Then a man (sometimes two) held a war dance around the tree. It was addressed and asked if one could expect good fortune and the man attempted to cut it down with one stroke. The girls seized its leaves (the one who got the ones from the top would certainly become a shaman) and danced around the tree once more.

The girls then proceeded to bathe in the river. First, however, the shamans took the girls hats and moved them seven times back and forth over the water ( ndarajo ), scooped up some of it along with a particular kind of water bug and let the girls drink from it. The entire proceedings at the river were called mopandajora after this ceremony. While the girls bathed the shamans recited their litanies to the accompaniment of drums ( karatu ). Once bathed the girls donned the new bark cloth clothes which the shamans had painted for them during the preceding days. A shaman told Kruyt that the gods from the upper and underworlds met at this ceremony. So far as she knew it had only really happened once, when the culture hero Lasaeo lived on earth, but the ceremonies were still observed that had been performed then (II, 106ff.).

On the way back to the village leave was taken from the wurake at a specially planted tree, kadju mburake, “wurake tree”, or kadju mpopaata, “escort tree”. Just outside the village the procession was attacked by men with the stems of a certain plant. They were soon defeated and the girls and shamans returned in triumph to the temple or feast hut (II, 108f.).

After a moment the girls swarmed out again over the village, taking anything they felt like. According to the Toradja: “They show themselves to the bela to show that they aren’t afraid of them because they have been received into the guild of the wurake . In this function they may take everything they want to, and one must give them everything they ask for” (II, 109).

Back in the temple or hut the girls hands were scratched and beads and herbs were supposedly rubbed inside the palms. This was done to give them the power of removing disease-causing objects from people’s bodies ( mopagere ) and to make everything that they planted flourish. Finally the girls took off their special clothes and donned their white ones, which they kept on until they were worn out (II, 109f.).

The ostensible purpose of the momparilangka was to introduce the girls to the wurake and to train them as shamans. Aside from particular features corresponding to the religious beliefs of the Toradja, however, the ceremonies followed the usual pattern of initiation ceremonies. Thus the girls were separated from the rest of the community in an enclosure, where they underwent a symbolic death (seclusion, restrictions on eating and defecating) and received instruction, and from which they emerged newly born (counting off of the feet before they touched the ground, bath at the river) in a new status. In this respect it parallelled the head-hunting ritual as it appeared in the mythology. The girls’ initiation also took place in the cosmic sphere, but whereas the head-hunters were aided by the ancestors in the underworld, the shamans were helped by the wurake in the upperworld. Thus the two rituals were complementary, expressing the ties of the community with the two poles of the universe.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Ritual196,Incision of the Penis,"As we have seen, head-hunting itself constituted the main initiation for males. In addition, every youth was supposed to be incised, have his front teeth shortened and inflict several burns on himself. No elaborate ceremonies were held for these operations, however.

Boys were incised ( montindi, mopatindi ) anywhere from their sixth to fifteenth year. If a boy had had sexual intercourse before the operation, however, it was thought to be dangerous both for him and the operator and could have harmful effects on the rice plants. It was usually performed on the occasion of some sacrificial feast or other, though some of the older boys who were ashamed to have it done in public asked an uncle or some other blood relative who had killed at least one enemy to do it for them separately. Often boys performed it on each other in the forest. The most desirable occasion for it was on the return of a successful raiding party, either during the moganda or mompeleleka . It was most often performed, however, during the feast for the new rice in the smithy ( mopatawi ).

During the moganda it was done under a rice barn, if there was one near the temple; if not the notched log serving as steps was taken from one and placed on the ground near the temple for the boys to sit on. The boys to be incised were seized and brought together there, not without opposition on their part. Each boy in turn was seated facing east on the log, a fresh skull, the head-hunting trophy of arenga leaves ( towugi ), a brass tray (in Lage) or rice block (in Wotu) (elsewhere - I, 360 - Kruyt also gave the head of a slaughtered buffalo as a possibility) with the tadulako facing him. The boy was then struck with the shell string ( batu rangka ) and the victory cry was given. The tadulako inserted the tip of his sword under the prepuce, rubbed the blood from it while reciting a charm to prevent the loss of blood, and struck it with a coconut shell used as cover for a rice pot, a skull or (in Palande) a piece of bamboo. Wood could not be used for this. While this was going on the war song ( dolu ) was sung. The blood was washed away with water in which certain vigorous plants ( mentuwu ) had been placed.

In general women were not allowed to watch the operation, for which various reasons were given. Either the wound would fail to heal or become infected, or women themselves would suffer from sore eyes or swelling of the vagina. Others said they stayed away from shame. Nowhere, however, could the parents be present, as that would shorten the boys’ lives.

The Toradja gave several reasons for incision. It enabled one to get many and healthy children by removing the evil ( bui ) from the penis; it made the person himself healthy, for the spirits would no longer bother him, having gotten their due; and it made one brave. Only few boys refused to undergo the operation, and they were heaped with scorn (II, 434ff.).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual197,Funeral 1,"Funerals

The Toradja had two funerals, which were separated by a considerable length of time. At the first of these the bodies were placed in temporary huts outside the village; at the second the bones were cleaned and given a definitive burial in caves.

Lamentations for the dead person began the moment he expired. They were always improvised, but stereotyped: it was said how much he was missed, he was asked why the mourners couldn’t have gone in his place and his virtues were summed up. For many of the mourners, at least, it was a purely formal affair, unconnected with feelings of affection for the dead person. Many young girls, it would seem, participated merely to show off their voices. Men hardly ever took part in it and some were even quite annoyed by it (II, 461f.).

The corpse was laid out soon after death, preferably by some one who fetched the bones for the second funeral ( tonggola ), otherwise by an older member of the family. It was not washed, nor were its clothes usually removed, new and handsome ones being put on over the old ones or laid over the body. Cloths were bound about the knees, arms and around the head under the chin to make the body easier to carry and to keep the mouth from falling open. Now and then gold dust, a gold piece or beads (preferably white) were put into its mouth, supposedly as food for its angga . In Pu’u-mboto they said on this occasion: “Just as white as the beads will be the grain of the rice which you will give us. Do not come to us in the guise of pigs, mice or rice birds; give us the grain ( po’oe ).” Sometimes beads were placed on the eyes, a small mirror on the chest and pieces of money on the cheeks and forehead (II, 465f.).

A bit of the hair and the nails of the dead person were cut off and made up into a package along with the knife used for this purpose. They were either carried about or kept in the house (presumably by the closest relative, though from other remarks it would seem that the hair and nails of much loved or admired persons were in great demand) for a long time - by some as long six generations. During the first funeral, from the time the body was removed from the house until the moombe ue had been performed (see p. 83 below), this package served as a substitute for the dead person, a bit of everything one ate or chewed being placed beside it. Hair and nails were said to be kept “so that his tanoana will be transferred to us”. Many said that they allayed their longing for the dead, and others, “We keep hair and nails in order not to forget the dead, and the dead will then bless us.” They were also used as medicine for the crops, and it was said that, “If we didn’t cut off the nails of the dead they would pinch off the rice ears with them or dig up the roots of the plants.” A widow would keep the hair of her dead husband “so that his tanoana would not part from hers”, but would throw it away when she remarried (II, 467f.).

Once the corpse was dressed it was laid on a mat in the most appropriate part of the house and a sort of canopy ( batuwali ) was built over it. The batuwali (the word probably once meant “room”-Wdb.) consisted of four bamboo posts with cross bars, covered with a piece of cotton or sleeping mat to form the roof, and with curtains hung from the cross bars. Pinang blossoms were hung from the posts and beads by the head of the corpse. Beside the body was a basket with sirih-pinang and an egg, which served as its food. The batuwali was further decorated with various cotton goods, some of which later accompanied the corpse as presents (II, 469f.).

While the body remained in the house it was fed. The food was placed beside it and removed after an hour and given to a slave to eat. At some point or other during the proceedings a buffalo and a few pigs were killed, the former being intended to serve as a means of transportation to the underworld for its master. The house was always full of people, especially at night. A circle which could not be broken was formed around the batuwali in order to protect the dead person from witches or the souls of the dead. The hearth fire and a torch had, moreover, to be kept burning. The people keeping watch could not sleep for a moment, as this would not only endanger the corpse but their own tanoana could easily be seized and taken to the underworld (II, 470ff.). Round dances ( kajori, raego ) and certain singing games were prohibited during these nights, though various others were especially performed on these occasions. Chief among the latter were the djondjo awa and the lina, which formed the greatest attractions for the young people. The first of these consisted in reciting improvised couplets which were alternated with a refrain beginning with the words djondjo awa . Kruyt thought these words probably came from ndjo’u-ndjo’u wawa, meaning “go, go, accompany him” or “take him away”, referring to the dead person. The lina was a song, plaintively sung, each line of which ended with the meaningless word lina, which Kruyt thought came from linga, “to sing”, but which the Toradja equated with ine, “mother”. The two games were alternated. They were said to be performed to distract and console the angga now that it had to leave the earth, and in them the angga was first taken on a trip to another region and then conducted to the underworld, or, in at least one case, to Buju mpotumangi, “the mountain of weeping”, where it was handed over to other souls of the dead who had come to meet it. When leave was taken from the angga it was asked not to take the tanoana of the rice and other plants with it to the underworld, which would make the crops fail. Throughout the djondjo awa and lina a man and a young girl carried on a conversation of a piquant nature.

These two games were compared by the Toradja with the mopasangke, performed at the time of the harvest (see below). According to both Adriani (1912: III, 544f.) and Kruyt they had no religious significance, presumably because they did not accomplish an actual removal of the dead person to the underworld, which was done later by the shaman, but they were nevertheless felt to be more than mere games and could have serious consequences for the participants. In the Lake district an old man or woman performed the ritual of tearing a stalk in two ( mantjela panga ) before they were started so that the young people would suffer no ill consequences from them, and those present were not allowed to fall asleep or leave before the end for fear that their tanoana would remain in the underworld (II, 474ff.).

The coffin was called either bangka or jumu . The second of these was a general term meaning “covering”; the first meant “boat”, and was still used in Pu’u-mboto in this sense. That the coffin was indeed thought of as a boat is born out by the fact that if one dreamed of somebody rowing in a boat it was assumed that that person would soon die. The coffin was hollowed out of a tree trunk split lengthwise to form a cover, called lakinja, “the man”, and a receptacle, called tinanja, “the woman”. Aside from the handles at either end, which were sometimes carved in the form of animal heads (Kruyt had seen those of pigs and goats) and which supposedly had not particular significance, the coffins were not decorated (II, 481.; 1912: II, 90).

There were various categories of people, of course, who did not get one. One was made only for valued slaves, the others being wrapped in bark or pounded bamboo and buried in the ground. People who had died from smallpox or leprosy did not get one either, except for particularly respected persons, and in their case special precautions were taken and their bones were not fetched later on for the second funeral. There was no common practice with respect to those who had died from an accident. Women who had died in childbirth were given one, but they were brought directly to the caves and their bones were also not brought back for the second funeral. The corpses of stillborn children and infants of two or three days and those executed for incest also received special treatment (II, 487ff.).

Various things were put into the coffin along with the body depending on the region or tribe. Around Lake Poso rice was put in the coffins of people who had possessed a great deal of it during their lives, whereas in Lage no rice was put in for fear that this contact with the dead person would make the crops fail. It was a general rule, however, in contrast to the West Toradja, not to put iron objects, particularly sharp ones, in coffins as this was thought to have bad consequences both for the crops and the people themselves. Distinction was also generally made in preparing the coffins for males and females II, 490ff.).",1,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual198,Funeral 2,"Before the coffin was removed from the house a shaman performed the mowurake mpo’onto tanoana, “shaman’s ritual to hold back the tanoana ”, over the closest relatives, supposedly to keep their souls from following the coffin. They squatted down near it and were covered by a costly old cloth ( bana ). The shaman then touched all the heads under the cloth and finally the coffin with a rare consisting of a young arenga palm leaf and small bell and a basket in which was a branch of cordyline. This she repeated seven times and then touched the corpse with it seven times from the feet to the head while reciting a litany. This was also called montende rare, “to toss up the rare ,” which was also the name of another ceremony performed over the corpses of shamans, shortly to be described. It also closely resembles the ritual performed for the departing head-hunters to prevent their tanoana from deserting them ( ma’onto tanoana ntau anu malai ). They sat in a group facing east and were covered with a sheet of white cotton. The shaman then struck them on their heads with a branch of cordyline ( moarosi ) and afterwards gave them rare, which they rubbed over their bodies before attacking the enemy in order to make their muscles strong (I, 293).

Unfortunately Kruyt did not record the litanies recited on these occasions, so it is impossible to be sure of their significance, but it would seem that in all the cases the purpose was to prepare the people for a hazardous journey. The funeral ceremony was performed according to Kruyt to keep the tanoana of the surviving close relatives from following the dead person, but as we shall see, they too were supposed to be in the underworld while in mourning, so it is possible that the ceremony served to prepare them for this trip. As the dead person was similarly treated with he rare it may also have been done with the same intention. This, at any rate, was the explanation given by the Toradja for the montende rare performed over the corpse of a shaman.

When removing the coffin and on the way to its temporary shelter outside the village everything was done to prevent the soul of the dead from finding its way back to its home, except in the case of people who had left no relatives of the same generation behind. It was removed through the window, or if it was too small a wall was taken out for this purpose, and sometimes (generally in the case of infants) it was let out through the floor. Contact between the augga and the living was several times ritually broken on the way to the hut (II, 494ff.).

The small hut which served as temporary resting place for the corpse ( tambea ) was a pile construction created a short distance to the north, south or west of the village. It was never built to the east of it, as the village would then lie in the path of the angga, which went to the west. Account was also taken of the prevailing wind, to reduce to a minimum the smell of the rotting corpse in the village. It was solidly built, with no walls and a low roof. The roof was laid on differently than in houses for the living and the notched tree trunk which served as a ladder was placed so that the steps faced downwards, as the dead saw everything reversed. Long bamboo poles, each with a piece of white cotton attached, were erected about the hut. In the Lake district there was one on each side, elsewhere four, one at each corner, and in Palande six, three on each side. The poles, which bore the name of lae ntula, “pole with sign”, were cut down when a head was brought in to end the mourning (II, 502f.).

Upon arrival the coffin was placed in the hut with the feet pointing west. A hole was made in the bottom in which a long bamboo was inserted which reached to the ground and served to drain off the juices of decomposition. Then (in Lage at any rate and also Kruyt presumed, elsewhere) the shaman performed a ritual to lure back the tanoana of family members which might have gotten into the coffin so that they would not be taken by the angga to the underworld. The cover was then placed on the coffin, which was bound about with rattan, eight times for men and nine for women. Finally the cracks between the two parts were filled with fungus and covered with strips of bark cloth. A sleeping mat, a food basket, a cooking pot, the dead person’s sirih pouch and sword and a few other articles and food were either hung from or laid on the roof of the hut.

Somewhat different customs were observed with respect to the corpse of a shaman. According to Kruyt these were to be explained by the fact that the soul ( angga ) of a shaman did not go to the underworld ( Torate ), but to Mungku mpe'anta-anta, “the mountain which serves as resting place”, in “the land of the wurake spirits in the sky”. This was supposed to be where the roads from the upper and underworlds came together. Unfortunately, however, in the litany which Kruyt quoted in this connection her soul was spoken of as going to Nanggi or Linduju , both names for the underworld. Supposedly to demonstrate that her “soul” went to heaven a small bamboo was placed in her mouth as a blow pipe through which she blew her “breath” ( inosa ) to the sky. As we have seen, however, inosa is “life force” and is closely akin to tanoana, thus quite different from angga . The ceremony by which, according to Kruyt, the shaman’s soul was brought to heaven was called montende rare, “to toss up the rare ”. According to the Toradja it served “to equip the dead person’s augga (for its trip)” ( mampapoiwo angga ntau mate ). The rare was not actually tossed in the air, however, but only passed back and forth between three men on one side of the coffin and four shamans on the other, while the latter recited the above-mentioned litany. When the coffin had been removed from the house it was set on the ground and a shaman walked seven times around it with a spear in her hand, saying that the dead person was not allowed to take things with her to Nanggi or Linduju . Although Kruyt first said the the montende rare was performed to bring the soul of the shaman to heaven he later said that it was done to prevent her from taking the “life force” of things with her and added that therefore in Pu’umboto it was called mo’ontobi, “to put an obstacle in the way” to prevent her soul from going to the underworld instead of to heaven. He offered no proof for this last assertion, however, and we have already seen an almost identical pair of terms used for similar ceremonies for the ordinary dead (mowurake mpo’onto tanoana and montende rare) . If these ceremonies did indeed have such a different significance, as Kruyt maintained (II, 494), it is not clear from the data he presented. Moreover, the bones of the shamans were collected along with the others at the second funeral, where they underwent the same ceremonies. It is of course possible that a double destination was accorded the shamans, within their inosa or tanoana going to the wurake, with whom they had been so closely allied in life, and their angga going to the underworld.

The corpses of shamans, finally, had polished rice thrown over them, as did those of agricultural sando and those who left nobody of their own generation behind, to prevent them from taking the soul of the rice with them (II, 498), and shamans guarded the death house two nights after the removal of the corpse to prevent its angga from returning to seize the tanoana of its relatives (II, 513ff.).

A hen or rooster, depending on whether or not the dead person was female or male respectively, was also tied to the hut or coffin. It was called tandojae or tando ijae, which meant “end of the section (of bamboo or similar plant)”. According to a man in Lamusa everybody got such a fowl, but only the one for some who left no generation mates behind was called tandojae . Whether this was actually the origin of the term, as Kruyt supposed, or was only a rationalization on the part of the Toradja is hard to say, however. At any rate, the Toradja could offer no explanation as to the purpose of the usage, and the fowl could be taken by any one outside the community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual199,Tandojae,"For the corpse of an important person a slave was designated as tandojae ; at least that was the case in Onda’e, Lage and Lamusa according to the first edition (1912: II, 101) and Adriani (Wdb.). He slept in the hut at night and kept a torch burning, and in the daytime he kept the flies away and wiped up the liquids from the corpse. His main duty was to prevent witches from “eating up” the body. He could talk to no one and took his food where he could find it. Nobody could object to this because “the tandojae lives as an angga , and who would have an angga in service”. The tandojae stayed with the corpse until its bones had been fetched for the second funeral, and he returned then to a changed status. In some places he changed masters or was sold, in others he was no longer treated like the other slaves, but with some distinction. In most tribes, however, he became a free man, built his own house and tilled his own fields. Nevertheless he was treated as something of an outcast and was not supposed to be well-disposed toward his fellow man (II, 504f.).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual200,Second Burial,"To return to the ceremonies themselves, the course of events at them was briefly as follows). About eleven in the morning of the first day the bones were fetched by the bone collectors ( tonggola ), roughly sorted out and made up into packages. When they returned to the village one of the oldest female touggola treated everybody who felt the least bit sick with one of the skulls. After this the bones were brought to the feast grounds where the male tonggola slaughtered a tethered buffalo. At the mompemate the bones were then deposited on mats on the floor of the feast hut. At the motengke they were first made up like dolls, provided with masks ( pemia, ) from Mori mia, “human being”, or kalio, “image of a face”) and placed on a catafalque ( solikaro, from Mori, possibly meaning “those whose bodies are dead”). There was one type of mask for females and one for males, the latter being distinguished by two decorations ( sanggori and kidu ) traditionally belonging to the equipment of head-hunting leaders. After the ceremonies they were stored in the rice barn along with other decorations from the feast and were used again for succeeding funerals. The solikaro consisted of a solid bench about two by one and a quarter meters, the bottom of which was about one and a quarter meters above the floor. It was surrounded by pieces of costly cotton ( bana ) and decorated with cordyline, sugar cane, swords and shields, and a widu of slightly different design than the one described above was stuck into each corner post (II, 534ff.).

The souls of the people whose bones had been assembled were brought from the underworld by the shamans. At the mompemate there was no prescribed number of them, but at the motengke there had to be five plus two male assistants. The litany described how the dead were waked, dressed themselves and were conducted through the underworld to the pinang tree which they climbed to reach the earth, where they came out in Mori (to the east of the Toradja), and finally were led to the temple or feast hut. There they were welcomed by their relatives and entertained by them and the rest of the participants with singing and dancing. In the songs the dead were brought up to date on the current affairs of the living. During this part of the ceremonies, which lasted a whole night from dusk to dawn, the men were permitted to ask a girl to be their partner. The man rested his elbow on the girl’s shoulder and was allowed to touch her face and breast, in exchange for which he gave her a sarong or some other present. When she had had enough of it she would hang a white cotton or bark cloth sarong over his shoulder and the relationship would be ended. While they were together they were considered to be man and wife (II, 542ff.).",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual201,Moandu sala,"Moandu sala, Morambu langi

It will be remembered that some marriages normally prohibited could be made if preceded by a piacular offering for incest. This took two forms, depending on the degree of proximity of the people concerned. The simpler of the two was called moandu sala , to float (the) evil away”. The couple concerned went to the river with a white fowl and a pig. They either sat on the rope attached to the latter or on the stick used to carry it or both animals were carried around them seven times. A hole was dug beside them. An elder then invoked the gods: O you above and you below, here is our present of reconciliation (polanga) , which we give in place of X and Y (the names of the guilty persons), who have been stupid, so that the guilt will be taken from them and floated down the river and rain and drought will regularly alternate. May the water take away their guilt and dump it into the abyss, through the yellow places in the river, through the white and through the dark, till it comes to the sea and the latter propel it and bring it to where it falls down below.” Then clothing of the man and the woman were placed in the hole and the fowl and pig were killed, while the couple placed their hands on them, by a brother or cousin of the man, who first said: “Here are two people who have committed incest; actually they sould be killed themselves, but we now kill a pig and a fowl in their place.” The blood was dripped onto the clothes in the hole, which was then closed up. Part of the blood was mixed with water and sprinkled on the couple and their fellow villagers. Part of the pig was eaten (but not by the guilty couple) and the rest was thrown into the river. Either before or after this meal the couple walked a way into the river, let an old jacket float away and called, “My guilt has been removed” (II, 278ff.).

Before the work could begin the sins of the community had to be floated down the river (moandu sala)",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual202,Morambu langi,"For the more elaborate form, morambu langi, “to becloud the sky”, the man had to provide a male buffalo and the woman a brown striped pig or one with a white belly ( wawu bala ). In addition one or more white fowl were required (II, 277). On the way to the river the guilty man often had mud thrown at him and buffalo dung stuffed in his mouth. An altar ( lampa’ani ) was erected there and a hole or two intersecting ditches running east southeast - west southwest (or east northeast - west northwest) and north - south. The pig was placed near it or them and surrounded by red cotton, while the couple squatted there too and were covered with white cotton. The leader (presumably an elder) invoked the gods with his right foot on the pig and a white fowl under his arm: “Pue mpalaburu, who made mankind, who tore the fingers apart, split the mouth and pricked through the nose and ears; if you are lying on your back, turn over on your stomach and listen to my words. Ndo i ntegolili, who overtake the sins with the mouth, the hand and the whole body, great and small sins, listen to what I have to say. And you there below, Ndara, who carry the earth on your head, if you are lying on your stomach, turn on your back to hear what I have to say. You have seen the sin of our children, who will now marry each other. Their guilt is certainly very great, but here we have an offering of reconciliation ( pesumbo’o ), a pig and seven pieces of cotton as substitutes for their persons. Look no longer upon their sin and make their marriage happy. Prevent all harmful animals who threaten our fields, cattle plague and contagious diseases from approaching us, so that they will not come upon us as a result of the sin of our children, who are now being married.” In addition various local spirits were often called to witness the ceremony. Fowl and pig were killed and their blood dripped into the hole. The buffalo was then killed after being addressed (in Pu’u-mboto, at least): “I give you here sirih, buffalo, so that you will go up to Pue mpalaburu and to Kai ntoara lino (cf. above, p. 14 for this figure) to tell him (sic) that you are dead. Say then: I have not died from a disease or any kind of evil, but I have been slaughtered by the human beings to speak about people who are not of the same generation. I put the marriage of these two right again, so that they will get children easily and the harvest will succeed.” He then speared the buffalo, which was finished off by the others. After the meal which followed a miniature prahu, in which were placed various things (not everywhere the same), including clothes of the couple, an egg and (or) a coin touched by all the villagers, parts of the animals sacrificed and various edible plants, was floated down the river. When this had been done every one passed under a miniature gate ( djompo ) set up on the bank and were treated with medicine (II, 280ff.).

From the name of this ceremony, “to becloud the sky”, one would imagine that it was a means of warding off impending drought, but Kruyt recorded an instance of the use of a symbolic form of incest to make it rain. A rooster and a sow were killed by the river, joined and bound tightly together with a piece of cotton. Then the village chief, who performed the ceremony, invoked the gods: “O gods above and below, if you have pity on us and want us to eat this year, give us rain. If you don’t give us rain, well then, we have buried here a rooster and a sow in intimate embrace” (I, 399). Kruyt did not say why these particular animals were chosen in all these instances, but it seems likely that they represented the upper and underworlds, the rooster, as we have seen, being associated with the former and the pig with the latter, where a white-bellied pig ( wawu bala ) guarded the tree which led to it. They were, moreover, the usual victims in sacrifices to the gods of both. The idea would seem to be that after the initial separation of heaven and earth (which was occasioned by the incest of Ndara with her nephew), which established the future order of things, they could never again be joined together).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual203,Mowase,"Mowase

Mowase, “to apply blood to”, was an elaborate ceremony performed for various purposes: to cure a patient whom other means had failed to help or one who had become suddenly ill without apparent cause or one whose ailment was thought to be due to the wrath of Pue mpalaburu. It was most often done, however, when several people had become seriously ill in a village (II, 144). Other occasions mentioned were when children were still born or died shortly afterwards (II, 373), when one could not get children (1912: I, 385) and when prisoners of war were brought back to the village (I, 340). It could be performed with or without the aid of a shaman; in the latter case an old man or woman led the ritual.

The shamans (there was more than one when it was performed for a large number of people) fetched the lanoana of the patients on the eve of the ceremony and applied them to them on the following morning. Then everybody descended to the ground, where an elaborate altar ( lampa’ani ) was set up and a pig was placed at its foot. An elder then addressed the gods in the usual manner, his right foot on the pig and a white fowl in his arms: “O Pue mpalaburu at the rising of the sun, O Pue mpalaburu at the setting of the sun, who are on both sides of heaven, i Ndara there below, if you are lying face down turn this way to hear what I say. O Pue di songi, Ngkai mantande songka, who let the liana on which I hang grow downwards, who have separated the fingers. If you have turned upwards, turn this way. Here are we. Whether we have been guilty with the mouth or with the hand, here are a pig and a fowl, which I hold, and a buffalo; for our guilt we have brought a buffalo, a pig and a fowl. Whether our transgression stays in the rice bamboo, in the rice basket or in the house, here are a buffalo, a pig and a fowl, which bear our guilt”. The animals were slaughtered, their blood was caught and mixed with the finely chopped leaves of various vigorous plants and water. The shamans then rubbed the bodies of the patients with it. Part of the animals was hung up as offering, part went to the shamans as payment and the rest was consumed at the meal which followed (II, 144ff.).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual204,Mombakati,"The next step was the mombakati , “to mark something”. Before dawn of a particularly favorable day of the month each work group assembled in the forest on the land allotted to its leader. A spot was chosen where a pokae tree (Ficus erecta) grew; if there was none, one was transplanted from elsewhere (it made no difference if it died later on). A tree was preferred which leaned toward the east and which had a parasitic plant growing on it. The pokae was called “the tree of human life” (kadju Katuwu nlau) . It had grown from the body of some one who had had special power over rain and sunshine: “Therefore this tree became our god (lamoa) in the fields”. According to a story recorded in the first edition the ancestors instructed their descendants to plant the tree so that they would have a ladder by which to enter the fields (1912: II, 240).

Various signs which foretold the fate of the coming activities were observed and then a couple of square meters of the ground around the pokae were thoroughly cleared. Then sirih-pinang, beads and tobacco were prepared for the owner of the ground (tumpu ntana) , tree spirits (bela) , ancestors (sumanga uiau iu’a) and to make the ground cool. They were buried and sticks of pokae wood were planted around them. The leader then invoked first the gods above and below, who were asked for their help in the coming season. Next he addressed the dead (sumangali anu mate): “Perhaps you have come to watch us, or perhaps you are laughing at us because we don’t follow the rules properly, for we are dumb, blind and deaf; do not come and speak to us. If you hadn’t insisted on leaving us you would still be with us and it would be you who buried the sirih-pinang in the ground. You have served the gods of the fields whom we now invoke, for we have taken your place. Even though we do something of which you don’t approve, do not speak to us about it, so that we won’t get feverish and sick, so that we will stay healthy as long as we till this field”. Finally he addressed the pokae itself: “You, pokae , whose second name is kadju ndatunde (“tree which is persuaded to help”), we have chosen you above all other trees. Whenever we come to do anything in the field we will give you food, you who watch over the field. If we do anything wrong you must put it right, if we sin with our mouths, with our hands or with our bodies you must let us know of it”. The leader then cut some of the undergrowth around the cleared spot with a certain number of strokes and chopped down the pokae sticks with a single blow. A day or two later the ground around the pokae was inspected for omens (III, 30ff.).

The spot where the mombakati was performed was called pongkaresi , “sweeper, scraper”, Kruyt said this referred to the pokae , which was supposed to sweep away all the evil influences on the plants and in the air. The verb mongkaresi , however, refers to the weeding of the ground around the pokae (Wdb. sub kare ), so that this would seem to be rather doubtful . Once the mombakati had been performed in the leader’s field each of the households installed a pongkaresi in their own. They were located in the eastern part of the fields, but were the center of all activities there. A field containing a pongkaresi was called nawu (from inawu , “where the ground has been cleared of undergrowth”). There all religious regulations had to be strictly followed and offerings inaugurated all activities. Usually, however, a household cultivated another field as well, called bonde , where these regulations and rituals were largely neglected (III, 33ff.).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual205,Molanggo,"They day before the rice was planted a big feast, molanggo , was given at which a large number of gods and spirits were invoked. It was sometimes said that it served to “bring the anitu and the lamoa nawu together”, but Kruyt did not mention either among those invoked. These were, first of all, Ndara, the earth goddess, who was asked to drive away everything bad so that the crop would succeed, and Pue mpalaburu, who was to protect the people from evil and give them the grain of the rice. Then Ndo i ronda eo and Ndo i ntjungata dila (apparently an agricultural goddess - she was not mentioned elsewhere) were also asked for the grain of the rice. Next the leader drenched the earth with the blood of a fowl and split a stalk (mantjela panga) to remove the sins of the people. Then he invoked the tree stumps and, at the edge of the field, the bela . Just outside the field, by the path which led to it, the rampo (gluttonous spirits) were asked to stay away. Even the improper words which might have been spoken by the people and which could have an ill effect on the crops were disowned. Finally a couple of square meters of ground were set apart and planted for the angga . The seeds of the pumpkins, cucumbers, rice and maize which were planted there were bitten so that they wouldn’t come up, otherwise the crops of the living would fail. The angga were then addressed: “Come you dead to plant your rice, for you will do it. tonight; tomorrow we do it. Make our field shrink so that we will soon be finished with the planting. Do not come to look at our field and do not visit us in the form of mice and pigs”. Then the leader and a few companions sat down to a meal with the angga (III, 50ff.).

Before dusk that afternoon the youths were encouraged to play at striking each other’s calves (mowinti) , a rather painful endurance contest. This was done on other festive occasions as well, but was obligatory on this one, as it was thought to have a beneficial effect on the crops (III, 54).

During the night, while the young people performed round dances, a shaman recited a litany in the field hut in which she asked the wurake for the soul of the rice (lanoana mpae) . She brought back a couple of rice grains, which were planted by the pongkaresi , where the rice soul for the whole field was thought to stay till the harvest (III, 58).",0,0,0,0,1,1
Ritual206,Harvest,"At dawn the next day a ceremonial procession was held to the field. When she arrived at the hut there the leader first invoked the dead, whom she asked not to mislead the harvesters, but to guide them in their work, and then she and her helpers made packages of harvest “medicines”. Next she prepared what was variously called pesua , “place of entering” (in Onda’e, Pada, the lake district, Pu’u-mboto and Salu-maoge - Wdb. sub kara ), karanja , “smith’s hearth”, originally “hard core”, “center of something”, and, less commonly, potunda mpedongga , “seat of the harvest” and pompakapupu , “where (the harvest) is ended”. The field was conceived of as a human body, and the leader chose a spot for the pesua on its chest, thus in the upper part of the field, but on the left side of it (Kruyt did not say in what relation it stood, if any, with the pongkarest ). There she sought out a rice plant that suited her (various criteria were followed), bound it together with three others and treated them with various medicines. A small hut (kandepe pesua) was erected over them (III, 104ff.; 1912: II, 279). Close by the pesua she ceremonially treated and cut another plant, the tadulako mpae , “leader of the rice”, and then proceeded to harvest alone for a certain number of days (III, 108ff.).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual207,Molinga,"Towards the end of the harvest, when some of the families had finished with their fields and if the yield had been good, the youths assembled before one of the houses in the village and sang verses (molinga) to the girls, who had come together there. The verses mostly concerned the events of married life (examples are given in 1912: III, 542f.). This was repeated a few times, but not on consecutive nights. The final night the youths and girls assembled in a house, where they sang the verses while seated opposite each other. They were assumed to be married, and the verses were about a trip made to a distant place. In some tribes this was followed by the description of a trip to the upperworld on the rainbow in order to inform the gods that the harvest was nearly over (III, 131ff.).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual208,Mopasangke,"The next day (this sometimes preceded and sometimes coincided with the harvest feast) the molinga was ended with the mopasangke . Two poles about three meters high were erected three to four meters apart. They were called ambarale (which probably referred originally to the two miniature houses which used to be set up instead of the poles), toko mpajope , “pole of descent”, or toko sora , “decorated pole”. Cross bars were attached to the tops of the poles and presents hung from them, those for the women on one pole and those for the men on the other. In addition the ritual clothes (ajapa lamoa) of the shaman and harvest leader were hung on the one and those worn by the men at the head-hunting feasts on the other. The youths and girls who had taken part in the molinga sat around the poles and the rest of the villagers ranged themselves around them in a wide circle. Verses were sung back and forth between the men and the women, first about the poles and then about the separation of the youthful couples. Before the poles were dismantled and the presents exchanged, a man walked around the men’s pole seven times, squatting down after each time around to sing verses. In these he asked that no misfortune befall him for taking down the pole and boasted of his heroic deeds as a head-hunter. A woman then did the same around the women’s pole, bragging of her trips to the upperworld in the moon (III, 132ff.; 1912: III, 538ff.; Wdb.).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual209,"Mpadungku, Harvest Feast","Early in the morning of the harvest feast ( mpadungku , “to bring to an end”, or “bring (something) to its point of destination”) the leader went to her field, where she cut the rice ears from the pesua . In some districts she was accompanied by a man, who gave the victory cry the moment she did this. One or more knots were tied in the stubble and kandoruangi blossoms were placed in them as widu (other widu decorated the bone coffins and catafalques and were placed in the bodies of the enemy - see above p. 85).

The rice she put in her harvest basket along with that which she had cut from the tadulako mpae at the beginning of the harvest, sirih “to be used as drum sticks”, a piece of pinang leaf-sheath “to serve as center plank (patasi) of the temple”, half a coconut shell “as head covering” and a lobster shell and snail shells “as dishes”. A trumpet was made for her from rice straw and she blew it a certain number of times over the basket (III, 136f.).

The feast was then held at the field hut, where rice from all the fields (one bundle from each) was brought. Colored rice was placed on an alter outside it, with water, palm wine and a pig at its foot. Then an elder stood by it with a white fowl in his arm and his right foot on the pig, and invoked a long series of gods, whom he asked to give even more rice the following year. In the example given by Kruyt the names of most of the principle gods of the upper and underworlds appear, but also many not mentioned elsewhere which appear to belong to agricultural spirits. After this the pig and fowl were carried around the hut and altar seven times followed by all the harvest leaders. This was called magolili tonggola , “to walk around the tonggola (the hut in which the coffins were placed)”. The fowl was killed above the rice and its feathers were stuck in the ground around it. The blood of the pig was allowed to flow into a hole in the ground. Those present dipped their fingers in it and marked their cheeks with it (III, 138f.).

While all this was going on the harvest was celebrated, if it had been particularly successful, by the singing of the tawanggu . They resembled the bolingoni sung during the harvesting, but were more serious in character.

In Onda’e the rice goddess there, Lise, was conducted back to the upperworld at the end of it (III, 170ff.). The youths made trumpets from rice straw and engaged in mock battles with the rice stubble as weapons (III, 139).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual210,Potlatch,"Outline of a Potlatch

The potlatch itself varies considerably in its combinations and sequences of events, depending on the locality, the whims and fortunes of the hosts, and the purpose of the particular event; but a synthetic sketch of a funeral and house potlatch will serve as a convenient point of reference for some of the generalizations to follow.

Let us suppose that it is about 1900, and that the highest ranking local sib chief has died and was buried a year ago. Now in the fall his gravehouse has been set up, and a new lineage house has been built by men of the opposite moiety to take the place of the dead chief’s house. The new chief (son of the sister of the deceased) and his sibmates have collected sufficient wealth and food for the occasion, and invitations have been extended to the guest sibs by two of the host’s nakani (siblings-in-law)—say, his sister’s husbands. Both the local sibs of the opposite moiety are invited, and two out-of-town sibs are expected. To refuse an invitation would be the gravest of insults, and when the nakani delivered their invitations many months ago, the invited sibs had feasted them well.

During their journey to the host village the visiting guests practice their songs and dances at every stop, and they are fed and housed by any of the host’s sib who live along the route. On their arrival at the host village, they do not enter it directly, but camp close by. The next day necessary arrangements for song leaders are made—one woman and two men from each sib—and special attendants are appointed for them. Then the visitors, dressed in dance costume and singing “foreign” songs, are conveyed to the town in war canoes manned by young men of the host sib. There the out-of-town guests find the local sibs of their own moiety singing and dancing on the beach, thus making the beginning of a sequence of rival entertainments between local and visiting guest sibs which will last throughout the full eight days of ceremonial activity.

The host chief humbly steps out into the water and touches the visitors’ canoes in welcome. Eloquent greetings and much “respect talk” are exchanged by the highest ranking chiefs of the host and guest moieties. Finally the visitors are brought ashore to the new house, where, for the first four mornings, they wake at dawn so that they can sing to their hosts in the ritually auspicious hour just before the ravens begin to call. The second day begins a succession of parties in which the hosts feast the visiting and local guest sibs in each of their three highest ranking lineage houses. In payment for this, the rival sibs of the guest moiety alternately vie with each other in singing and dancing, and perform prodigious feats of eating seal blubber and drinking grease. The behavior of all participants is scrutinized by the hosts so that just payment may be made later. In spite of the joking of “sib children,” the competition grows bitter.

On the fifth day the actual potlatch ceremony begins. At dawn the host chief has delivered a mourning speech from the door of his house, while all the other house chiefs in the village stood outside listening respectfully. The host sib has fasted since the previous evening and now dons full regalia. All of the guests are properly seated, with the highest ranking in the places of honor at the rear of the new house, while the hosts stand by the door.

The finest old style food is served, especially the favorites of the recently deceased chief. Women of the host sib serve the food under the direction of the new chief’s sisters-in-law, his brother’s two wives, whose share is saved for them since they belong to the side being feasted. The symbolism of the feast is intense, for all food is eaten for the dead—not only for the dead chief, but for all ancestors of the host moiety. Other food which is put into the fire also reaches the departed, and the fine china bowls which contained it are given to high ranking guests. Two nakani loudly announce the names of the dead who are to receive the food, so that the spirits of the other world may hear. The guests themselves represent their own illustrious ancestors who have come to “show respect” and to comfort their grieving hosts.

When the meal is over, the host chief, wearing the most honored crest hat of his sib, initiates eight potlatch songs and dances, and begins in this way the collection of wealth which is to be distributed to the guests: furs, tanned skins, a valuable old “copper,” blankets, bolts of calico, and money. After making his own contribution, the chief calls on his people one by one, men and women, naming the highest ranking individuals first. Before these persons add their goods or money, the high ranking ones make long speeches referring to their dead ancestors, and they too wear their most honored hats and other paraphernalia and start valuable potlatch songs and dances in which they are joined by their sibmates. The line of dancers dips and rises as the leaders lower and raise their ceremonial song paddles to the drummer’s beat. Emotions mount, and many weep at the memories of the dead and of the incidents in sib history recalled by the songs and oratory.

In conjunction with this display of valued symbols and the “throwing away of so many dollars for respect,” the newly built lineage house receives the name of the older one, and the stories illustrated by the newly carved interior posts are fully explained. The new house chief assumes the illustrious name of his dead uncle; grandparents bestow honored names on their grandchildren; and a new name referring to the potlatch itself is given to a favored son’s son. In order to support it properly, the boy’s grandfather “kills a slave”—not literally, but in terms of equivalent wealth given away. A noble girl has her hands tattooed with her sib crest by her “father’s brother,” and other such steps are taken to validate social positions. Each action is marked by a contribution. Although the chief who is nominally giving the potlatch provides the greatest amount of wealth, all of his ranking sibmates ostentatiously give what they can. Members of other sibs in the host moiety are also called, but they do not add much unless they are closely related to the deceased. Two nakani call out the name of each contributor and of the dead person being honored. They also keep track of the amounts collected and then announce the total so that “the dead will hear it.”

Now the distribution of wealth begins, with the nakani again acting as pages. Every bit must be given away, since this is the only way in which the dead can receive its benefit in the spirit world. Should any of the collected goods be withheld, the host sib will suffer “bad luck”. The payments require the most delicate judgment. Primarily the guests must be suitably rewarded for the duties they performed at the death of the old chief, and for building his gravehouse and the new lineage house. Whether one carried the corpse or only a few boards, due recognition must be made, although some have already been paid once at the “tea party” following the funeral many months ago. Payments for those unable to attend the potlatch are entrusted to their house chiefs. All guests, even those who did nothing at all and are of the lowest rank, must receive something, if only half a blanket and a dollar bill. In addition, the high ranking are given presents based on finely shaded social status, measured in terms of wealth, character, past potlatching activities, and the important and intricate network of family connections. Those who distinguished themselves by eating the largest squares of blubber or by drinking enough grease to vomit at one of the earlier feasts, or who in some other way showed respect to their hosts, must also be rewarded. The business of distribution is complicated, and the hosts fondly hope that they can avoid the grumbling or actual fighting that sometimes follows.

Since the process of collection and distribution takes two days and nights, from time to time the leading guest chief formally requests a recess for the guests, for the long sitting grows “very tiresome.”

When the potlatching is finally concluded, the time comes for the guests to thank and comfort their hosts with formal speeches, and to cheer them up by dancing and singing in their own ceremonial paraphernalia. Their return party is given the next day, when they may take the opportunity to name one of their own grandchildren and pay to display some of their valued emblems. But this distribution is not on the same scale as the potlatch proper and the chief emphasis is on dancing and singing a thanks to the hosts. Masked dances are performed by some, and “war dances,” joking and other acts become the order of the day. The guest sibs again try to outdo each other. They dance in the house of one of the local guest sibs, for were they to do it in the host’s new house, much money would have to be “thrown away” to the opposite moiety for its use.

When the thank-you party is over, the chief purpose of the potlatch has been accomplished. The hosts say that they have “put their troubles away” and that the dead chief has been alone on an island, but the guests have helped bring him “back to the mainland.” Perhaps this symbolically puts him in the position of being ready to be born again, for his death has been properly “finished,” and his nephew—installed as the new lineage chief and bearing the old chief’s name—will take his uncle’s widow as wife. The hosts are happy.

After two more days of feasting the visitors depart. But some guests still grumble at the meanness of their potlatch gifts; others recall with chuckles the clever joking after the pay-off between a ranking guest chief and his daughter-in-law. A serious minded young nobleman reflects on the new sib traditions he has heard. The carving and symbolism of the new houseposts are discussed, and the host village is compared with that of the visitor’s. The latter conclude their own to be superior in every way. Next winter they will have a chance to prove their point when they in turn will invite their recent hosts to a potlatch.",1,0,0,0,1,

Ritual214,Dedication of the House,"Dedication of the House and Raising a Totem Pole

When the house was ready, the owner and his family [lineage] would enter, the men standing near the door in ordinary clothes, the women dressed in dance blankets [button blankets] and ornaments were ranged on each side near the walls. Then the drum was beaten four times four, and they swayed the body with it. [Paul specified that the men swayed.] This dance is called Ah-ketch, “putting it together with wings” [[unknown]yaduwakí[unknown]c, “they had a housewarming ceremony,” from kít[unknown]c, “wings”]. [Paul: “The four corners of the house are put together with their wings. It takes less than an hour to go through this performance.”] This procedure may have originated at a very early period when the walls of the house were constructed by lashing planks together and each side was raised in one section. This is the only ceremony in which no guests were present. [Paul: “When this dance is over, another invitation is sent out to the same guests.”]",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual215,"Dedication of the House, Smoking Feast","In the evening, the clans of the opposite phratry assembled for the Smoking Feast, Sa-kesk-ko-eek [[unknown]se[unknown]q-[unknown]yís qu[unknown]i[unknown][unknown]x; see Table 26].

[Paul: This feast is called W[unknown]o da h[unknown]un, “Rising,” [wudaha[unknown]n, “is standing”]. The black is taken off their faces, and their clothing is changed [this refers to the mourning hosts]. So this is called Ya da klatch ( Ya da Keetch ) [possibly yá-da[unknown][unknown] le[unknown][unknown]x w ], meaning “reddened face,” or “red painted face.” Red paint is put on the widow above the forehead, just where the hair parts. That means taking off mourning.]
The host, with one of his family who acts as a leader, and other men of his family [clan, lineage?], all poorly dressed, with dance staffs in hand, stood in front, just to one side of the doorway; the women of the family, wearing ceremonial blankets [button blankets] and ornaments were ranged along the walls on either side. The guests were seated in the body of the house around the fire, those most important opposite the door.

The host welcomed his guests and related his family history. He was answered by the guest chiefs [heads of houses]. The Na-ka-nee [na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni], “[clan] brothers-in-law,” separated the tobacco leaves, pieces of which were put into the fire as the names of the dead were called; they were believed to be present in spirit and to receive the gift as it was consumed by the flame with the same satisfaction as felt by those who were present in the flesh. The host might furnish pipes to the most honored guests, but the people generally brought their own. The Na-ka-nee [na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni] filled them and lit the pipes for the guests.

Then the leader started the family songs [of the host clan], and called on members of the family to start other songs. The women of the family sang and swayed their bodies in unison with the song. At this feast there might be a small distribution of property for those who helped with the gravehouse.

[Paul added a number of details:

The leader calls on each man to start up a song. After each song, blankets and calico are distributed. Each woman is called upon to start a song. At this feast they take new names, any name of their dead relatives. They are called by their new names at this feast. [Is this simply a device by which the dead may smoke too? Are these “potlatch names” permanent?]
During this time, the Na-ka-nee are like waiters on the Queen [a ship] when there are crowds of tourists on her. They do all the waiting on the guests, lighting the pipes for the guests, tearing blankets and calico [to be distributed], and starting up songs for those that have no husbands [these must be women of the host clan, not guests]; and the wives are scolding them, or telling them not to forget one particular person who had helped to dress the [dead] chief, or who had helped to put moccasins on his feet, and so forth; and the poor Na-ka-nee are sometimes bewildered, and don’t know hardly what to do! But they always take it so good-naturedly; they seem to be proud to be Na-ka-nee .
“Na-ka-nee” is used as a by-word. Anyone that has not any modesty is spoken to: “Are you Na ka nee, that you have no shame? [No proper modesty?].” . . .
At this dance the women sway themselves sideways. No sticks are used [?], The faces are painted red and black: Raven’s Wing, Raven’s Tracks, Raven’s Bill, or Frog’s Footprints. These are the face paints.
After this feast, the next day is for food.]",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual216,"Dedication of the House, Meeting, Ut-keh-yes-ko-eek","The next day, about ten o’clock in the morning, the drums were beaten and the guests assembled in ordinary dress and filled the body of the house. As before, the host, with the men of his family [clan], stood at the left of the door, poorly dressed and with dance staff in hand. The women of the family were dressed [in ceremonial clothing, as before] and were ranged along the side walls. This meeting was called Ut-keh-yes-ko-eek, “calling for food” [[unknown]at-[unknown]xa[unknown]yís qu[unknown]í[unknown][unknown]x, “inviting to eat”], or “calling together for food.” The host spoke of the dead, and as food was put in the fire by the Na-ka-nee, the names of the dead were called out, for it was believed that their spirits were present and that they heard their names and benefited by the gift [of food], not only spiritually, but in some material way that cannot be explained. The leader might sing the songs of the old shamans of the family [lineage] at this time, asking for good weather.

Then the feast dishes were brought out and placed before the guests and filled with food: dried salmon and grease, berries in grease, seaweed, salmon or herring spawn in grease; and beaten-up soapberry was always served last and was most esteemed. The two sides [rival groups of guests] might eat in competition with each other; individuals might be selected to do so, and he who ate the most, however sick it might make him, honored the host the most. Often the leader might call upon certain ones to drink a set quantity of oil, or to eat a whole dish full. In some cases, when the dishes were filled, the guest [guests?] rose, with spoon in hand, and danced while standing in place, with motions of the body, to honor the host. After the food was consumed the guests left.

[This is the first time that Emmons has mentioned the two rival groups of guests. Swanton (1909:375) explained that at Wrangell, if a Na[unknown]n[unknown]ya[unknown][unknown]a[unknown][unknown]yí (Wolf 18) woman had died, her clan would be the hosts, and the Kiks[unknown]ádi (Raven 10), Ti[unknown][unknown]y hít-ta[unknown]n (Raven 11), and Qa[unknown][unknown]c[unknown]ádi (Raven 28) would “dance on one side” and the Ka[unknown]s[unknown]xag w e[unknown]dí (Raven 32) and Ta[unknown][unknown]lq w e[unknown]dí (Raven 33) would dance on the other. These were like two teams that “dance against each other,” wu[unknown][unknown]s [unknown]yá[unknown][unknown]adu[unknown]le[unknown][unknown]x. In the example cited by Swanton these two groups were all residents of Wrangell, and the occasion was the evening of the day that a totem pole had been erected. This had been done by the Na[unknown]n[unknown]ya[unknown][unknown]a[unknown][unknown]yí (Wolf 18) chief, presumably in honor of his dead kinswoman. Swanton specified:

Each side had two song leaders, a head song leader and a second song leader, who bear dancing batons.
All this is done only when a chief or one of his family had died, not for a common person, and the first side to dance is that to which the widower [as in this case], or the widow of the deceased belongs. [1909:375]
[This rivalry between two groups of guests, belonging to different clans, or to different groups of lineages, is a crucial feature of every potlatch. The alignment of lineages and clans was traditional, as Swanton (1908:435) has indicated. Thus, at Sitka, the Box House People (Qu[unknown]k w hít-ta[unknown]n, Wolf 3) danced against the Wolf House and Eagle’s Nest lineages, both sides being considered as branches of the Ka[unknown]g w a[unknown]nta[unknown]n (Wolf 1). At Sitka, the Kiks[unknown]ádi (Raven 10) were rivals of the [unknown]uk w na[unknown]x[unknown]ádi (Raven 6) and[unknown] Xa[unknown]tka[unknown]a[unknown][unknown]yí (Raven 7), when invited by Sitka Wolves to a potlatch. At Wrangell, the Kiks[unknown]ádi, Qa[unknown][unknown]c[unknown]ádi, and Ti[unknown][unknown]y hít-ta[unknown]n (Ravens 10, 28, and 11) were grouped opposite to the Ka[unknown]s[unknown]xag w e[unknown]dí and Ta[unknown][unknown]q w e[unknown]dí (Ravens 32 and 33). There the Na[unknown]n[unknown]ya[unknown][unknown]a[unknown][unknown]yí (Wolf 18) and[unknown] Sikna[unknown]x[unknown]ádi (Wolf 19) were rivals of the[unknown] Xu[unknown][unknown]x w e[unknown]dí (Wolf 26), Ka[unknown]yá[unknown][unknown]ska hít-ta[unknown]n (Wolf 25), and probably also the [unknown]Xe[unknown][unknown] q w á[unknown]n (Wolf 31) when the latter joined the Stikine tribe. In somewhat similar fashion, the clans from the home village and those from another tribe’s village, when invited as guests to a potlatch, were traditional rivals (see below, “A Major Potlatch”).

[As indicated by Swanton (1909:375), in speeches of the host to the opposite clans, he addresses them by kinship terms, based upon his relationship to them, actual or traditional. Thus, a Wolf chief at Wrangell might address the five Raven clans there as: “My father’s brothers, my grandfathers, people that I came from, my ancestors, and my mother’s grandfathers.”

[Paul explained the feast and the later dancing:

When all the guests are in, there are speeches, talking to the spirits of the dead. Food is put into the fire, calling out each name of their dead relatives. Na-ka-nee do this. When all the dead relatives are named and remembered, the food is passed around to the guests. When everything is passed around, and every person’s dish is full up to the brim, the guests get up and dance with the spoons in their hands, meaning this dance [to] show their gratitude.
Before putting any food in the fire, the leaders [of the hosts] sing Ict’ s [[unknown]í[unknown]x[unknown]t, “shaman”], or Yake [yé[unknown]k, “shaman’s spirit”] songs; and the women sometimes dance, shaking themselves. When through singing, the leader says he calls out the head chief of each family [clan, lineage] of his guests, and says, “I have sung these songs of my dead doctors that I may have good weather, that it may not rain on me, that it may not storm upon me. . . .” [For the exchange of meticulously polite speeches, full of the symbolism of the crests, see Swanton (1909:374-89).]
After the closing speeches, the leader [of the hosts] always the very last thing he says was to the head men of his guests, to arise and go in peace. And the head man gets up, and all follow him.
After this feast, the guests are divided in two parties. One of the parties going to dance first, the other party afterwards the same evening. It is called Gratitude Dance.]
In the afternoon [after the feasting], the guests dressed and returned [to the house of the host]. They divided into two sides, one dancing in the afternoon, and the other in the evening. These dances were to show respect to the host and gratitude for the food. They were theatrical and were usually copied from foreign peoples, whose dress and movements were imitated, and the words to the songs were in their languages. Each side sang four songs. Great care had to be exercised not to exceed this number, nor to offend their rivals in reffering to their crests, for all were highly excited, and a minor incident was likely to cause a clash resulting in bloodshed and a feud.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual217,Minor Potlatch,"The feasting and dancing that preceded the distribution of property might continue for several days. The dancers, dressed in ceremonial blankets or skin clothing, carried rattles, eagle tails, bows, spears, etc., and wore spruce root hats or the ceremonial headdress, Shack-ee-et [[unknown]saki[unknown][unknown]át, “something on the head”]. This was a hat covered with swan skin with a mask in front, a crown of sea lion whiskers filled with bird down, and several rows of ermine skins pendant behind. After dressing in their houses, each family formed a separate procession, and, headed by a drum, marched to the feast house where, one at a time, they danced into the house in a stooping posture, jumping up and down in quick jerks and shaking the rattle, or moving their arms spasmodically. The dancer moved his head very slowly after entering and danced to one side of the house, where all were finally assembled in many lines. The song accompanied by the drum, the rapid movement of the bodies in varied dress, the air filled with light eagle down, the nervous expectancy of both the host and his guests that some old feud might break out through intention or want of control, all combined to make a never-to-be-forgotten scene.

[Paul wrote:

After the Gratitude Dance, the next day, comes Potlatch, feast. The drum is sounded early in the morning. It means that every relative that received presents, or ke hiss [qé[unknown]hí[unknown][unknown]x, “ceremonial fee”] from the hands of the leader’s [host’s] wife, is now being called to remember these gifts that she made to their wives. [These wives would belong to the same moiety as the host.] Each relative opens his [?, her] trunk and takes out blanket after blanket: five blankets, ten blankets, fifty blankets. It is very interesting to watch. Sometimes whole tribe [clan? moiety?] going to the new house; they carry the blankets as you have seen Chinaman carrying his water pail—two men with a long pole, shoulder to shoulder. Upon it the blankets are thrown. No ceremony. When they bring it into the house, the leader says gonacheese [[unknown]guna[unknown][unknown][unknown]cí[unknown][unknown]s, “thank you”], as each Na-kah-nee comes in with the blankets.]
Those of the opposite phratry—the family of the host’s wife—brought the property in blankets, including the loan. These were counted, piled, and marked by the host’s wife. These, together with the property that the host and his family expected to distribute, were placed in piles to one side of the entrance.

[Meanwhile] the host was dressed by his slaves, with the crest headpiece and the family robes that had descended to him through a long line of ancestors, and carried in his hand a long staff. Sometimes a new wooden hat was carved for the occasion. This headpiece [hat or helmet] was the most valued article in the possession of a family [clan] and was always in the keeping of the head chief. It was never exhibited except at potlatches when property was distributed, or at death, when it was placed by the side of the corpse that was lying in state. The “grandchildren” of the host’s clan were also dressed by slaves. [These slaves were freed after the potlatch.]

[Paul continued:

When that is all settled [bringing in the blankets], the old drum is sounded again. It is to call the workers [on the house or pole, now guests] together, to receive payment. When that is done, the leader’s wife, with a f . . . [?] look on her face, gets up from the corner of the house where all the blankets were piled up. She takes it [them] out and hands it down to Na-ka-nee, and there is made pile upon pile in the center of the room.
[When] the people assembled, the more honored guests, usually men, were seated opposite the door, and the women on either side. The host, the leader, and the principal men of his family [clan] stood to the left of the doorway where the blankets and other property were piled in the corner. The women of the family, in ceremonial dress, were ranged along the side walls of the house, and joined in the songs.
[The blankets were counted and made into separate piles in the middle of the room, according to the designated recipients. This was done, I believe, in the presence of the guests, and Paul specified that “all is silent.”]

After the host, in a long speech, had related his family history, and had taken a new name, that of his predecessor if a chief, or of some ancestor on his mother’s side [i.e., in his own line], he would likewise give new names to his “grandchildren” from the same source, and give the end of his staff to the slaves he was freeing [because they had dressed him and the “grandchildren”].

[As explained by Paul, the “grandchildren” might be anyone in a clan of the same moiety as the host’s: preferably his son’s son’s clan. These new names were honorable names, those of men referring to a crest of the host’s clan (possibly used previously), while those given to women were made up for the occasion and usually referred to the new house or pole for which the potlatch was given. Paul did not, however, make clear whether any member of the host’s clan who was contributing property had a right to give a name to a “grandchild,” as was the case at Yakutat.]

The distribution of property was [then] made by the Na-ka-nee . The giver [contributor of specific blankets or other goods] was privileged to select the recipient [among the guests of the opposite moiety] and to name the particular dead person in whose honor the gift was made. The property was held up by the Na-ka-nee, who called out the name of the recipient. The latter answered: Artay, “this way” ha[unknown]dé[unknown], ha[unknown]ndé[unknown]]. This distribution served to discharge all obligations to those who dressed the dead, carried out the corpse, performed all the offices of cremation, carved the totem pole, built the gravehouse, or the house. All of these were paid, and old debts of long standing might likewise be discharged.",1,0,0,1,1,1
Ritual218,Major Potlatch,"A Major Potlatch

[Some of the potlatches described in the preceding sections I would call minor ceremonies, because only “opposites” within the village of the host clan were invited. A major potlatch, qu[unknown]í[unknown]x [unknown]e[unknown]n, “big invitation,” was one involving guests from another tribe, as well as from the home village, and was therefore a more lavish and expensive affair. This was the potlatch called Qkhatasi, “to raise up” or “to glorify the dead” ([unknown]xáda[unknown] [unknown]si[unknown]yí; or possibly qa[unknown]da[unknown][unknown] si[unknown]yí, “song” or “singing about the dead people”), by Veniaminov ([1840] 1984:421-23; Holmberg 1855:46-49; Petroff 1884:171-72). This potlatch was the last of what Olson (1967:61-63) called the four “joy feasts,” following the four “crying feasts” and so ending the funeral cycle of eight feasts, “to finish the body” of the deceased—eight, because of the eight bones of the body. This great potlatch was to pay the members of the opposite moiety who had built a new house or refurbished an older one as a memorial to the dead predecessor of the new house chief, and to all the dead of the lineage. The ceremony was held in the new house. The “opposites” might also have built one or more gravehouses for the host clan. During their labors, they had been feasted and given gifts, at the “three joy feasts” that preceded the great potlatch. (Any potlatch, however, to pay for erecting a grave monument, pole, or house, would be called a qkhatashi, even if no guests were invited from another town, I believe.)

[Emmons wrote (1910c:230):

Preparations for the function may occupy the lifetime in the accumulation of material to be given away, and the invitations are personally delivered months or a year in advance. The guests, including generally two tribes or two village clans, if living at a distance get ready as soon as they return from the summer camps. The canoes are repainted and decorated, dancing paraphernalia is unpacked and gone over, a sufficient food supply for the travel is put aside, and a programme of dances and songs with which to honor their host is arranged. Households embark together in the largest canoes and as in war parties are under the direct supervision of their chief. They travel and camp together and practice their dances and songs en route. From time to time the host receives notification of their progress and when they are within one camp of their destination, he sends to envoys and food to them.]
When families from another tribe are to be asked, the wife or Na-ka-nee [na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni], “brothers-in-law,” including those that have married sisters, aunts or cousins [mother’s sisters, and mother’s sister’s daughters of the host], go in canoes and extend the invitation, collecting property [to be given away at the potlatch], and [later, at the designated time] they accompany the guests, bringing up the rear during the entire travel, so that none may straggle.

Those invited select two leaders for the songs and dances which they practice every night when they camp [on the way to the potlatch]. These leaders must fast for two days and keep away from women. It was the invariable custom that visitors, whether invited or not, should never come directly to a strange village, but should land and camp the preceding night at some distance, the place being designated by the host’s friends, who met them bringing food.

That night the guests might man their canoes and pretend to attack the village with loud cries and the beating of their paddles on the gunwales of the canoes, and then return after the [host] village had been thoroughly aroused, for in early days villages were attacked at night, and even when expecting such a play, the people would become greatly excited.

The next day the guests would don their dance costumes, paint their faces in red and black, and [Emmons 1910c:230-34:

The men and women . . . have the hair dressed with red ochre and bird’s down. With drum, rattle, and dance staff they [the principal personages among the guests] take their places in the sterns of the canoes which now follow each other in column. . . .]
The line would slowly paddle toward the village of their hosts, the occupants singing. [Emmons 1910c:234:

[Near the village] . . . they form in line abreast and holding gunwale to gunwale stand in slowly to the shore, the occupants singing and dancing to the accompaniment of the drum. When nearing the beach those paddling hold water, the bow and stern men get out the poles and the line of boats is kept in position, while speeches are exchanged through several hours.]
Stopping in front of the chief’s house, the canoes would be held afloat, just clear of the shore, by paddles and poles, and families of their phratry, residents of the village, who were likewise guests, would assemble on the beach in ceremonial dress, dancing and singing their family [clan] songs, in honor of the host and in part as a welcome to the visitors. [When finished], they would retire.

[The local guest clans and the clan or clans from away formed the two rival groups that “danced against each other.” Some of the songs they sang were “peace songs” to each other, in which the others were addressed as “clan children” of their hosts, flattering the latter, or the singers expressed their love for the clan-children of their rivals (persons of the opposite moiety, actual or potential sweethearts).]

The host would then appear and a pantomime would be enacted by him or his family. This pantomime was highly spectacular and generally illustrative, both in dress and action, of the crest animal. After this, the chief of the visitors, standing in the stern of his canoe, would speak, and when finished, would be answered from the shore by the host, who would end with an invitation to land. Then the canoes would separate, turn, and back in [stern first] in front of the houses designated for their reception, when those on shore would rush into the water and unload them. In old times the chiefs would be picked up and carried to shore.

[Shukoff described the coming of the guests (I have corrected the translator’s text—FdeL):

Before potlatch is given, the owner [of the new house] practices the ceremony of reception beforehand, his speech, how to receive the guests, and what songs and dances the hosts will use. The people make different hats out of wood to be used in dances.
Dancers at a Klukwan potlatch. Photograph by Winter and Pond, no. 208, in 1895. (AMNH.) Note that there is snow on the ground, and the house is different from that on page 293. The dancers are in Athabaskan costume, or wear Raven moiety crests, so presumably are members of Raven 3, at some earlier potlatch at Klukwan.
When guests come, they camp one or two miles from the village and wait until night then they go to the village to scare the hosts; when they approach the house they halloo and strike their canoes with paddles, and sometimes they do scare the village. Then they go back to camp again; they don’t land that night. A little while afterwards, the chief sends relatives with provisions to the guests: berries, karh-weh [kax w é[unknown][unknown]x, “highbush cranberries,” Viburnum edule ], preserved in seal oil, herring oil. Then he sends another canoe after wood to make his guests warm. He then takes his costumes out of his trunks, fur, buckskin clothes, and necklces of bird noses, kuhn har, “sea parrot” [[unknown]lu-gán, literally “nose-red,” the tufted puffin].
The next morning the guests come in canoes and before they land the owner of the house comes out and, with hand shading his eyes, looks at them as if they were strangers. And he asks the people around who they are and where they come from. And someone will tell that they see a certain chief from some village. Then this chief asks [the] one in the canoes who they are and where from. Then the [guest] chief answers them that they are his guests, and gives the names of his village and of himself. “We came here by the road or travel of the sun,” the guest answers. “They [We] came with good faith. We came to have a joyous time.”
Then they make speeches. [First] the guests call the people on shore, they call them each one by name, and they answer “Aye.” Then they make speeches concerning their ancestors, their pursuits and customs. The owner of the house makes a speech and says that he has just been out hunting and has killed several hair seal and has not had time to skin them. And he turns to his people and tells them to throw out hair seal bones on the beach. And instead, two men lead out a slave, holding him by the hand, and after they bring him before the guests, they kill him and leave the corpse on the shore. They then wipe blood off the trail so the guests won’t dirty their feet. Then they bring out another slave, and kill him instantly, striking him on the head with a club. And after they killed the slave, they drag the corpse along the trail where the first slave was killed, and thus the trail is killed; and they throw the [second] body by the side of the former corpse.
Then he [host chief] invites the guests, and they come into the house. He lays down the club, katu [ké[unknown][unknown]tu], and the guests enter house and examine the club and praise the carving. If a bear’s head is carved they call it hootz katu [xú[unknown]c ké[unknown][unknown]tu], “Bear Club.” They look at the spear with which the slave is killed [or had been killed?], called tsar karkle [ca[unknown]gá[unknown]l]. If it has killed people they call it nan-nar quar-tlar [na-ná, “death,” gwá[unknown]la[unknown], “dagger”], the old double-bladed knife. After examining knives and spears and clubs, they [the weapons] are put away, and all slaves are locked up in a room in the house, waiting for freedom or death.
Then after the potlatch is over, the spears, katu, and knives are put away and not taken out until someone dies, when more slaves may be killed. When any of the children die, the chief asks one of his slaves to take out katu and examine it, then put it back in box. Then he asks if he put it back nicely, and he answers “Yes.” Then he is freed with a great deal of noise.
Now they tear blankets and cotton [cloth], instead of killing slaves.
Festivals and potlatches begin in the evening when the chief dresses himself in clothes inherited from his uncle. They used to wear buckskin pants and shirt, and before a potlatch he dresses in clean clothes, wears a carved wooden hat, such as Bear [Hat], Beaver, Wolf, etc. Those hats generally have sealion whiskers above, and around; the center of the headdress is filled with eagle down. [This is the headdress called [unknown]saki[unknown][unknown]át, not a hat.] He wears a blanket of goat [wool], nar-ghen [na[unknown]xe[unknown]n], “Chilkat blanket”; and he wears earrings of abalone, very large 2¼ inches square. Then he puts a long stick of bone or ivory through the septum of his nose, takes a carved dancing stick in hand; and friends or relatives all dressed to suit themselves. The chief is dressed by his children or his slaves, and he must have the same number of slaves to assist in dressing as there are children, and the children are dressed each by one of these slaves at the same time.
[This last statement indicates a blending of the major house-building potlatch with the major potlatch for honoring children, either a confusion in Shukoff’s mind or an accurate statement of the conduct of potlatches in his day. Shukoff continued:

When the chief is dressed, he comes to the door and addresses the guests, viz.,
“You all know that my uncle was a great hunter, also my ancestors all were great hunters, they killed a great many wild animals and wounded a great many. The latter have gone back to the woods and are alive at the present time.” And that he himself does the same as his ancestors, and that’s how he became rich and owned many slaves.
After he has finished speaking he calls the slave that dressed him and gives him the end of the stick, and he tells him he is free and he can go, and so he frees all who dressed himself and his children.
After this they have a dance. They have no musical instruments save drums, and they keep time to singing. Head of drum [is] of deerskin. They start in to dress the guests by giving them pieces of blankets, and call each one’s name as they make the gift. And the guest answers “ Ar-táy, This way!” [ha[unknown]dé, or ha[unknown]ndé].
They don’t eat this day, but eat next day: hair seal, berries preserved in oil, eulachon grease, dried fish; and with feasting the festival ends. After [Often] the guests eat so much that they vomit, for the host tries his hospitality by making guests sick, and then it is to his honor afterwards that all got sick. And if no one should get sick, it would speak badly for the food. And those who vomit and get sick are made extra presents of blankets. All guests bring their own spoons and dishes, and they carry away all the food their dishes hold.
[The kind of reception given the guests, and the particular symbolism in the theatrical show and speeches made to greet the guests, vary from clan to clan, and lineage to lineage, depending on the ceremonial prerogatives of the host and the history of his house (see McClellan 1954). Some of the Southern Tlingit clans owned the right to display “Secret Society” spirit dances (yé[unknown]k [unknown]sa[unknown]ti), which they had obtained from the Tsimshian and Haida, and even at Sitka the Kiks[unknown]ádi clan put on copies of such Kwakiutl-derived shows (Olson 1967:98-100, 118-21). The dramatic simulation of recapturing and restoring a man who had drowned and been rescued by Land Otter Men, reported by Emmons as having been given at Sitka about 1887 (see Chapter 10, the section “Afterlife: Spirits, Souls, Reincarnation”) was such a display by the hosts at a potlatch. Emmons cited other examples, more typically Tlingit, of the reception and entertainment of guests:]

In 1891, when the Ka gwan tan [Ka[unknown]g w a[unknown]nta[unknown]n, Wolf 1] of Sitka invited the Tuck dane tan [[unknown]Taqde[unknown]nta[unknown]n, Raven 16] of Hoonah, the latter, in six canoes abreast, approached the village slowly, just dipping the paddles in the water. Stopping in front of the chief’s house, two chiefs standing in the stern of their canoes made long speeches, telling of their family. After they had finished, the Ka-gwan-tan house master, Kut-sin ish [Ku[unknown]ci[unknown]n-[unknown]í[unknown][unknown]s], “Father of the Mice,” opened the door and looked out, shading his eyes as if surprised. Hesitatingly he came hopping out sidewise, imitating the movements of an eagle, which was his crest and which he impersonated. Reaching a high boulder on the shore, he perched upon it, and moved his head slowly from side to side, like an eagle. He wore the family crest hat of wood representing an eagle [the “Eagle Hat”], and over a ceremonial blanket was a robe of plucked eagle skins. He had on a pair of ornamentally embroidered caribou skin trousers, his feet were bare, and in each hand he carried an eagle’s tail of white feathers. After remaining in this position for some minutes, he launched into a long speech, relating his family history, his delight in being honored by his visitors, and finally invited them to land.

In 1888, the Da-she-tan of Hootz-nu-wu [De[unknown][unknown]si[unknown]ta[unknown]n, Raven 13, of the Hutsnuwu] invited the Ka-gwan-tan and associated Wolf families of Sitka to a great potlatch, to celebrate the building of four family [clan] houses.

[This must have been to celebrate the rebuilding of houses destroyed in 1882 when Angoon was shelled by the Navy. According to notes in BCPA, the Wolf clans invited were the Ka[unknown]g w a[unknown]nta[unknown]n, Wolf 1; Ky-yaz-hit-tan, [unknown]Ga[unknown]yé[unknown][unknown]s hít-ta[unknown]n, or “Driftiron House People,” Wolf 6; and the Koke-hit-tan, Qu[unknown]k w hít-ta[unknown]n, “Box House People,” Wolf 3. The two latter groups have also been considered as lineages of the Ka[unknown]g w a[unknown]nta[unknown]n.]

These Sitkans to the number of over four hundred, in twenty large canoes, followed by the canoe bearing the invitation [that is, of the na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni], stopped at Kenasnow Island before reaching Angoon, and put on their dance dress. Crossing the narrow waterway, they came abreast in front of the village, where they were welcomed by the Tuck-cla-way-de [Daq[unknown]lawe[unknown]dí, Wolf 27], the Nush-kee-tan [Wu[unknown][unknown]ski[unknown]ta[unknown]n, Wolf 17], and Ta-qway-de [Te[unknown]q w e[unknown]dí, Wolf 32]. These were [local] villagers of their own phratry, and likewise guests of the Da-she-tan [Raven 13]. They were all in full costume, singing and dancing. When through, they retired to their houses. Then Ken-al-kow, the chief of the Da-she-tan, came out of his house. Seeing the canoes, he feigned great fear, and went from house to house crying “ Ats ka na ” [[unknown]a[unknown]t skiné[unknown]!], which one cries in fright, and having called all of his people, he returned to his house.

Then a subchief of the Da-she-tan came out with arrow in bow, crying “Ko-ho-ho!” which one cries when about to die, and those of the opposite phratry on shore called to him to attack the canoes. He went down to the water’s edge and suddenly, as if just discovering who they were, he threw down the bow, saying he would not hurt any Ka-gwan-tan . Then another Da-she-tan came out and invited the visitors to land. That evening the visitors dressed in dance costume and entertained their hosts with dances and songs they had learned the previous year from Vancouver Island natives who had been taken and interned at Sitka for illcit sealing.

[According to notes in BCPA] the potlatch lasted a number of days. On the second day, the guests were called together in the morning and given food: dried salmon, potatoes, beans and rice, “all in grease.” During the morning, when the meal was over, the Sitkan guests danced in the new house. That afternoon the Angoon Wolves danced. That evening, the guests were fed again: dried salmon and grease, potatoes, and soapberry. The Sitkans danced, then the Angoon Wolves danced. [It should be noted that the potatoes served were a “speciality” of Angoon.]

On the third day, the Dashetan fed their guests in the morning. In the forenoon, the Dashetan women dressed and danced until supper time. The guests in ordinary dress were spectators in the body of the house. The guests were fed their evening meal, after which the Sitkans danced, followed by the Angoon Wolves.

The same took place on the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh days. There was a potlatch for each house. There were four new houses, and it took one day for each to give blankets and food. [A note indicates that these days were the equivalent of the potlatch given on the third or fourth day of Rudolph’s outline, Table 26.] The guests dance the last evening, ending the potlatch. The givers of the feast never dance, and eat only after the guests have gone each day.

In later years, the Da-she-tan again entertained the Sitka [Wolf] families. When the canoes were just off shore and after the speeches had been made, a man costumed as a beaver suddenly sprang out of a hole on the shore [that had been] covered with light boards and neatly concealed. Impersonating the Beaver, he ran along the shore and disappeared. The Beaver was the principal crest of the Da-she-tan .

[A Beaver had led the founders of Angoon to their village site (de Laguna 1960:130-33). At a potlatch given at Angoon about 1948, a De[unknown][unknown]si[unknown]ta[unknown]n woman danced behind a blanket held up as a screen, only the Beaver Hat showing, as she made the hat imitate the movements of the animal (de Laguna field notes 1949).]

In 1899, when the Con-nuh-ta-de [[unknown]Ga[unknown]na[unknown]xte[unknown]dí, Raven 3] gave the last great feast at Chilkat [Klukwan], when the visitors from Sitka reached the village front, Yehl cock [Yé[unknown][unknown]lxá[unknown]k, “Raven’s Fragrance or Odor”], the second chief, came out of the house with drawn bow and arrow, as if to attack those in the canoes. Then followed Yehl gou-hu [Yé[unknown][unknown]l gu[unknown][unknown]x w ú, “Raven’s Slave,” George Shotridge], wearing the family crest, the Raven Hat, and leading a number of women.

[This potlatch was described to Swanton (1908:438-43) by one of the guests from Sitka, Dekin[unknown]a[unknown]k! u (De[unknown]ki-na[unknown]k w , “Little Haida,” or “Far-out-to-Sea People”). The belligerent gestures with the bow and arrow were made “because he was about to spend a great deal of money and [he] wished to show how brave he was” (p. 439). For the same reason, the host might wear the warrior’s Bear’s Ears. Swanton’s account is particularly valuable for explaining how the wife of “Raven’s Slave,” a Wolf woman, went as na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni to invite the Sitka Wolves to the potlatch, and how she collected over $2,000 worth of property from them, her people, as their contribution to the coming potlatch, because they had not built her husband’s house at Klukwan. The reckless behavior of the guests on the way to the potlatch, their rowdy fun and eating feats at the potlatch, and other details are well described.

[We might also note that a Chilkat chief by the name of Yé[unknown][unknown]l xá[unknown]k, “Raven’s Odor,” visited Yakutat in 1788, and that Swanton (1909, Tale 32, pp. 161-65) recounted how a chief of the same name, or title, perhaps the same man, was killed in a war between the Chilkat [unknown]Ga[unknown]na[unknown]xte[unknown]d[unknown]i and the [unknown]Luk w na[unknown]x[unknown]ádi, Raven 6, of Yakutat and Dry Bay, over rights to the Raven Hat.]

Two or more families of the opposite phratry, either of this or another tribe, were always invited to a potlatch. They were divided into two sides that competed with each other in songs and dances, and so keen was this rivalry that it took the greatest tact on the part of the leaders to prevent clashes ending in bloodshed. [Perhaps because rivalry between two groups of guests was most acute at the major intertribal potlatches, Emmons discussed guest rivalry only in this connection.]

[McClellan’s study of Tlingit ceremonialism (1954, esp. pp. 86, 96) has made clear the warlike character of Tlingit potlatches. Rivalries between the two groups of guests are present, no matter whether they both live in the same community or one group comes from another town. As she wrote:

. . .the guest competition is often symbolized as warfare, and sometimes leads to real fights. Each sib constantly watches the other for mistakes, and if one is detected, immediately begins to “make fun” of the erring group. A woman song leader told how she barely averted a riot when one of the opposing song leaders sang the same verse of a song twice. If one side sings more songs or does more dances than the other, this too means trouble. The institutionalized way of halting a resulting fight is for the hosts to run forward with their own crests. This act recalls to the guests the need for proper respect for the hosts’ emblems, which probably have added emotional significance as the crests of the guests’ grandfathers, fathers, wives, or children. [p.86]

[Veniaminov ([1840] (1984:421-23) wrote that the major potlatch, the Khatashi ([unknown]xáda[unknown][unknown] si[unknown][unknown]yí, “to raise the dead”), was given very rarely, and only by wealthy chiefs. Since 1828 there had been no such festivals, he wrote, because of the ruinous expense. The host would give away all his property, including his wife’s dowry, and the Tlingit had a saying or proverb for the man who had fallen into poverty: “You must have held a Khatashi .” Veniaminov specified that when the messengers were sent to different villages to invite the guests, they did not invite persons individually, but all, including wives and children, could come. (It is thus clear that the invitations given to house heads were understood as including their lineage mates, and all the members of their households.) They (the local guests) would erect new gravehouses for their host, and they would clean out the house in which the festival was to be held, and sometimes build a new house. Outside and inside would be displayed the clan emblems: the Kukhontani (Wolf 1), the Wolf or the Eagle; and the Takuyati (Wolf 32), the Bear.

[When the guests were assembled, the festival would begin with songs and dances, from the evening until dawn, followed by an excellent feast for the guests only. Singing, dancing, and feasting continued for several days, as long as the host could feed his guests. On the last evening, the chief of the hosts would retire and don the “sacred regalia” of his clan, which were reserved for such occasions, and could never be worn at other times, except when the Sitka natives danced onboard Russian ships. Veniaminov further specified that the Tlingit of the “Wolf Clan” had as their “sacred regalia” the skin of a wolf, complete with tail, paws, and head, and with teeth made out of wood or even copper. The Frog Clan (Kiks[unknown]adí, Raven 10) had a wooden hat with a frog on it and a cloak (blanket) with the figure of a frog.

[As the chief, wearing these things, stepped forward, accompanied by several slaves, someone outside would howl like a wolf or croak like a frog (i.e., utter the cry of the totem), the tone indicating whether slaves were to be freed or killed, and how many would die, matters already settled in advance. The slave who dressed the chief was always freed, so the chief would select this favorite. Then the hosts sang their clan songs, telling their clan history and the deeds of their ancestors. After this, the chief would be seated, the presents for the guests brought out. These were not distributed equally, for the most honored and wealthy received the most and the best, even slaves, while common people were given less.

[Next day the same festival would be held at the next house, and after that at the next, if the festival had been organized by the whole village (by houses of the same moiety in the village). At such potlatches, men of the host clan had the right to assume the name or title of deceased kinsmen. (We suppose they had to be wealthy men who had made significant contributions.) Chief’s wives also could take new names.

[This same information is summarized in the account by Petroff (1884:171-72), which is based on Holmberg’s translation (1855:46-49) of Veniaminov.

[Olson (1967:64-65) reported that formerly the Tlingit gave additional feasts in honor of the dead. One might be given years after a potlatch, in order to add to the gifts previously given. It was called gauwuta[unknown]n, “drum taking up to beat” [ga[unknown]w wuduwata[unknown]n, “drum has been taken up”?]. Other feasts or potlatches might be given when the host had dreamed of the dead; for example, a drinking feast might be given in answer to the request of the dead as conveyed in a dream. The guests were to get drunk so that the dead might enjoy the liquor. Of course, food and drink for the deceased were put into the fire on many other occasions. Some potlatches were given to enhance the prestige of the donor and his clan, the house being rebuilt to justify the occasion. Kan’s (1983) observations of recent potlatches, 1979-80, and his analysis of potlatch oratory would indicate that no great change has occurred, except for substituting modern goods for the old, and perhaps a further shortening of the ceremonial cycle; the basic meaning remains the same. There is only a difference in the time at which the host would exchange his ordinary, old clothes of the mourner for his full clan regalia.]",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual219,Ceremony for the Children,"Ceremony for the Children

[Veniaminov ([1840] 1984:424) listed a third major festival, “for children,” the other two being the wake (“to nourish the dead”) and the major potlatch just described (“to raise the dead”). The festival for the children was very expensive and was rarely given. Whereas the expenses of the wake and of the potlatch could be recovered when the donor was a guest of his “opposites,” at the children’s festival he was giving to members of his own clan, his children’s “opposites,” and therefore could never hope to recover his outlay. Slaves were not killed, but those who had dressed the children being honored were set free, and there had to be as many slaves as there were children. For this festival a new house was always built, but the workers were from both moieties, and all were paid; and at the ceremony held in the new house the ears of the children were pierced. True nobles, Angashi [[unknown]a[unknown]nqá[unknown]wu,[unknown] a[unknown]n[unknown]yádi-] were those who had had their ears pierced at such a potlatch, but only the most wealthy could attain four holes in each ear (eight for the “eight bones”), since this would require four such expensive festivals. Veniaminov noted that almost all the Indians at Sitka had pierced ears, but these were only pretenders to nobility.

[Olson (1967:68-69) explained this children’s potlatch in detail. Not only must the donor be very wealthy and high-born, but he must have inherited the right to give the celebrations; that is, someone in his lineage must have given one previously. The songs sung by the host were those sung by his predecessors, whose names he would recite to justify his right to hold the ceremony. All the houses in the village would be invited, both from the donor’s moiety and from the other. For a really big potlatch, a clan from another tribal village would be invited. (Olson referred to it as a “clan of the father’s moiety,” which might mean that it was a clan in the donor’s moiety, although this is not clear.) Eight men selected by the host from his own clan acted as na[unknown]-ká[unknown]ni. The ceremony would be given in the name of the host’s oldest child (boy or girl), but the rest of his children would be included, as well as others from the same matriline. The ceremony might be given to console a wife for the death of a child.

[The ceremony (except for the potlatch proper) would last a minimum of four days. The out-of-town guests would arrive the first day. The children to be honored would be placed at the rear of the house, the host’s clan-mates in the center, the visitors on the right side, the local guests on the left. Each group would sing two songs, go out to dress, and return to dance two dances. Then the host would feast them, his clansmen acting as waiters.

[On the night of the second day the host would lead eight songs. The two groups of guests each danced twice.

[On the third day was another feast, and that night all the groups, the host’s clan, visiting guests, and local guests, might each give special theatrical performances.

[On the fourth day the ears of the children were pierced by the highest ranking chiefs among the guests. If the children were tattooed—girls on the hands, boys on the hands and chest—this might take several days.

[A few days later some or all of the children would be given new names, the history of which would be explained. Then followed the distribution of gifts: the chiefs who had done the ear piercing or tattooing would receive the most, but something went to each person who had sung or danced.

[A ceremony of this kind was no longer given when Emmons was in Alaska. Ear piercing seems to have been accomplished at a lesser affair, one in which the operator was a father’s sister or similar relative, and tattooing was becoming obsolete.]",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual220,Girls Initiation,"In the case of a girl the period of childhood is brought to a close by a ceremony that takes place on the occasion of her first menstrual discharge. The ceremony I describe is that in use in the Northern tribes, but I believe that the ceremony of the Southern tribes is very similar. On the occurrence of the first menstrual discharge the girl tells her parents, who weep over her. She must then go and bathe in the sea for an hour or two by herself. After that she goes back to her parents hut or to a special shelter that is put up for the occasion. She is not required to go away from the camp. All ornaments are removed from her, only a single belt of Pandanus leaf being left, with an apron of [unknown]cainyo leaves. Strips of Pandanus leaf are attached round her arms near the shoulders and round her wrists, and others are placed as bands crossing her chest from the shoulder to the waist on the opposite side, and crossing her abdomen from the iliac crest on the one side to the trochanter on the other. These are so attached that the long loose ends hang down at the girl's side. Bunches of leaves, either [unknown]celmo ( Tetranthera lancoefolia ) or, if these be not obtainable, poramo ( Myristica longifolia ) are fastened beneath her belt before and behind. Other leaves of the same kind are placed for her to sit upon. The strips of Pandanus leaf and the bundle of leaves are visible in the photograph reproduced in Plate xvi .

Thus covered with leaves the girl must sit in the hut allotted to her, with her legs doubled up beneath her and her arms folded. A piece of wood or bamboo is placed at her back for her to lean against, as she may not lie down. If she is cramped she may stretch one of her legs or one of her arms, but not both arms or both legs at the same time. To feed herself she may release one of her hands, but she must not take up the food with her fingers; a skewer of [unknown]cainyo wood 1 is given her with which to feed herself. She may not speak nor sleep for 24 hours. Her wants are attended to by her parents and their friends, who sit near her to keep her from falling asleep.

The girl sits thus for three days. Early every morning she leaves the hut to bathe for an hour in the sea. At the end of the three days she resumes her life in the village. For a month following she must bathe in the sea every morning at dawn.

During the ceremony and for a short time afterwards the girl is not addressed or spoken of by name, but is referred to as Alebe or Toto . The meaning of the first word is not known. Toto is the name of the species of Pandanus from which women's belts are made and the leaves of which are used in the ceremony. On the occasion of this ceremony the girl is given a new name, her “flower-name,” and from this time till after the birth of her first child she is never addressed or spoken of by the name which she had as a child, but only by the name given to her at this ceremony. The name given is that of a plant or tree which is in flower at the time. If the ceremony takes place when the [unknown]jili is in flower she is called [unknown]Jili ; if when the [unknown]jeru is in flower she is named [unknown]Jeru , and so on. These names will be mentioned again later in the present chapter.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual221,Boys Initiation,"In the case of a boy there is no physiological event so clearly marked as there is in that of a girl. It rests with the relatives and friends to decide when the boy is to become aka-op . It would seem that in the Southern tribes there is no ceremony on this occasion. Among the Northern tribes the boy is made aka-op by means of a ceremony that consists of making the scars on his back that are customary in these tribes .

When the friends and relatives of a boy decide that he is old enough to have the incisions made in his back a dance is held in the evening, and the boy is required to dance through the whole night till he is tired. As soon as morning breaks he is made to bathe in the sea for two hours or so. He is then seated in some convenient place, not in a hut. The boy kneels down and bends forward till his elbows rest on the ground in front. One of the older men takes a pig-arrow and with the sharpened blade makes a series of cuts on the boy's back. Each cut is horizontal, and they are arranged in three vertical rows, each row consisting of from 20 to 30 cuts. When the cutting is finished the boy sits up, with a fire at his back, until the bleeding stops. During the operation and for a few hours following it the boy must remain silent. There is no treatment of the wounds to produce raised scars. The scars are much more noticeable on some men than on others.

The boy does not receive a new name on this occasion, but for a few weeks his own name is dropped and he is addressed and spoken of as E[unknown] jido . From this time the boy is described as being oko-taliy-kolot , this being the masculine term corresponding to aka-ndu-kolot for girls. From the time the cuts are made on his back the boy becomes aka-op and is under certain restrictions as to what foods he may eat.

When the wounds on his back are thoroughly healed similar cuts are made on his chest. I found a certain number of men who had no visible scars on their chests, but in the North Andaman every man has the three rows of scars on his back. Some of the women of the North Andaman have similar scars on their chests and a very few have them also on the back. These cars on women are not regularly made as part of the initiation ceremonies, and may be made after the woman has been married for some years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual222,"Ceremony to Release Youth from Turtle-Eating Restriction, Part 1","When the older men decide that it is time for a boy who has been abstaining from turtle to be released from the restriction, a turtle-hunting expedition is arranged, and this is continued until a fair number of good turtle are captured. The best of these is selected, killed, and cooked. The youth is seated in a hut, either that of his parents, or one placed at his disposal by a friend or one specially built All his ornaments are removed. (In the case of a girl one belt of Pandanus leaf is retained.) He is seated on leaves of the Hibiscus tiliaceus , or if these be not obtainable, on those of the Myristica longifolia , and a bundle of the same leaves is placed under his folded arms so as to cover his belly, while another bundle is placed at his back where there is some sort of rest provided for him to lean against. He must sit still with folded arms and with legs stretched out in front, the two big toes clasping each other. He sits facing towards the open sea, and a fire is placed near him, generally just beyond his feet.

Some man is chosen to take charge of the ceremony. This may be one of the older men of the community to which the youth belongs or a distinguished visitor, if there be any such present in the camp at the time. This man selects some of the meat and fat of the cooked turtle, placing them in a wooden dish. He comes to where the youth is seated, while the friends and relatives gather round. Taking some of the fat he rubs it first over the lips and then over the whole body of the youth, while the female relatives of the latter sit near and weep loudly. When the youth's body is thoroughly covered with fat the man who is performing the ceremony takes some burnt oxide of iron, such as is used for making red paint, and rubs it over the youth's whole body, except the hair of his head. He then takes a piece of turtle fat and places it in the youth's mouth, feeding him thus with a few mouthfuls which the youth eats in silence. At this point the weeping of the relatives is taken up again with renewed vigour and then gradually comes to an end. Having fed the youth the man then proceeds to massage him. He first stands behind him and placing his hands on his shoulders presses down on them with all his weight. Then he seizes a roll of flesh on each side of the youth's beily and shakes it up and down as though to shake down what has been eaten. The arms are next massaged and the wrists and knuckles are forcibly flexed so as to make the joints “crack.” The legs are similarly massaged, either with the hands or with the feet, the performer (in the latter case) standing on the outstretched legs of the youth and rolling the muscles beneath his feet . The joints of the toes are forcibly bent with the hand to make them “crack” if possible. A mixture of clay ( odu ) and water has been prepared in a wooden dish. The performer dips his hands into this and spatters it over the youth's body from head to foot, either by holding his hands near the youth and clapping them together, or by jerking the clay off his fingers with a flicking motion. During the whole of these proceedings the youth sits passive and silent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual223,"Ceremony to Release Youth from Turtle-Eating Restriction, Part 2","The first part of the ceremony is now over. The food tray containing turtle meat and fat, cut into small pieces, is placed beside the youth and he is provided with a skewer of the wood of the Hibiscus tiliaceus , as he may not touch the meat with his fingers. He must sit in the same position with legs outstretched and arms folded and surrounded with Hibiscus leaves. To feed himself he may unloose one arm, and when his legs are cramped he may double them up beneath him. He may not lie down nor speak nor sleep for 48 hours. During this period he may eat nothing but turtle and drink nothing but water. The man in charge of the ceremony sits behind him and gives him instructions as to what foods he may and what he may not eat after the ceremony. Some of the men and women take it in turn to sit beside the youth, attending to his wants and talking or singing to keep him awake.

On the morning of the third day a belt and necklace are made of pieces of the creeper called terkobito-balo , i.e. “centipede creeper” ( Pothos scandens ), and these are placed round the youth's waist and neck. On this day he is permitted to sleep. Either on the same day, or early the next morning, he has a bath in the sea, to remove some of the red paint and clay, and he is then decorated with red paint made of red ochre and turtle fat, and with white clay ( tol-odu ). The red paint is put on in stripes over his body, and his ears are daubed with it. The white clay is put on in a zig-zag pattern to be described later, the lines of white clay alternating with those of red paint. This decoration is done by female relatives.

Early on the morning of the fourth day, soon after daybreak, the whole village is astir. One of the older men takes his stand by the sounding-board used for marking time at dances, and the women sit down near him. The youth comes out from his hut and stands in the middle of the dancing ground, and five or six men stand round him in a circle, each of them facing towards the youth. Each of the men, including the youth, holds in each hand a bundle of twigs of the Hibiscus tiliaceus or, if such be not obtainable, of the Myristica longifolia . The man at the sounding-board sings a song, beating time with his foot, in the usual way, on the sounding-board, and at the chorus the women join in and mark the time by clapping their hands on their thighs. The song may be on any subject and is selected by the singer from his own repertory. A song referring to turtle-hunting is preferred. During the first song the dancers stand at their positions on the dancing ground, lifting up their leaf bundles at short intervals and bringing them down against their knees. The singer then commences a new song or repeats the former one, and when the song comes to an end the youth and those with him begin their dance. Each dancer flexes his hips so that his back is nearly horizontal. He raises his hands to the back of his neck so that the two bundles of leaves in his hands rest on his back. With knees flexed he leaps from the ground with both feet, keeping time to the beating of the sounding-board, which is about 144 beats to the minute. At the end of every eight jumps or so, the dancer brings his hands forwards, downwards and backwards, giving a vigorous sweep with the bundles of leaves, which scrape the ground at each side of his feet, and then brings back the bundles to their former position. They dance thus for 15 or 30 seconds and then pause to rest. The dance is repeated several times, until the youth is tired out. As the dance is extremely fatiguing this does not take long.

The youth then returns to his hut and resumes his former position. He may now, if he wishes, talk to his friends and he may sleep. He must retain the bundles of Hibiscus leaves and the necklace and belt of Pothos leaves. The dance is sometimes repeated in the afternoon. It is in any case repeated on each of the two days following, and after that the youth resumes his ordinary life. For a week or two he may not touch a bow and arrow. The Pothos leaves are worn till they are faded and are then discarded. The paint on the body wears off and is not renewed, but his ears are kept painted with red paint. For some weeks the youth is supposed to be in an abnormal condition and is carefully watched by his friends.

At the turtle-eating ceremony a new name is given to the youth. This name, however, never seems to be used afterwards either in speaking of or to the person to whom it belongs. A youth of the Aka-[unknown] Jeru tribe whose birth name was [unknown]Cop (from a species of tree) and whose nick-name or second name was Komar (from a species of fish) had two new names given to him on the occasion of the turtle-eating ceremony, [unknown]Cokbi-[unknown] ciro (meaning turtle-liver) and Pile[unknown] car (high-tide). Neither of these names was ever used in addressing him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual224,The Shedding of Tears,"“the shedding of tears.” The object of this ceremony is to release the mourners from the restrictions that they have had to observe. The ceremony takes place in the evening, and an occasion is chosen when there are plenty of people in the camp. The mourners, male and female, remove the odu clay from their foreheads and decorate themselves with red paint and white clay in the way described in connection with dancing. They also put on what ornaments of Pandanus leaf or netting and Dentalium shell they may possess or be able to borrow. When all the members of the camp are assembled around the dancing ground one of the male mourners takes his stand at the sounding-board and sings a song. This song does not refer in any way to the dead man or woman; it is just an ordinary song of hunting or canoe-cutting or any other subject, though it may have been specially composed for the occasion. Those women who are not in mourning sit near the singer and take up the chorus. When the song is fairly started the mourners, male and female, begin to dance. There is nothing special about the dance, which is exactly like any other dance. After dancing for a short time the mourners seat themselves at one end of the dancing ground and their friends begin to weep and wail. Everybody present joins in the lamentation until they are tired. The mourners then rise and again dance. After a time the women retire and seat themselves with the chorus, but the men continue the dance (in which they are joined by the other men present), till they are tired, which often means till near dawn. After this ceremony the mourners are free to eat any of the foods up till then forbidden, and are free once more to use red paint and white clay and to take their part in all dances and other festivities.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual225,Weather rite,"In connection with the cicada, and with the weather there is a rite which was described to me, but which I did not see performed. According to the account given of this rite, which is called “killing the cicada,” its purpose is to produce fine weather. It takes place in December, at the end of the season during which they eat the grub. When the time agreed upon for the performance of the ceremony arrives, all the members of the community are careful to be in the camp before sunset. As soon as the sun sets and the cicad[unknown] begin their shrill cry, all the men, women and children present begin to make as much noise as they possibly can, by banging on the sounding-board, striking the ground with bamboos, beating pieces of wood together, or hammering on the sides of canoes, while at the same time shouting. They continue the noise, which entirely drowns that of the cicada, until after darkness has fallen. The rite may be performed, I believe, two or more times, on successive evenings. My informant explained the rite by saying that the natives have been eating the cicada, and the rite is intended to “kill” those that are left. After the rite the cicada disappears and is not seen or heard for some weeks, and there follow four months of fine weather with little rain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual226,Naming Ceremony,"The Naming

Early in the morning of the eighth day the formal naming ceremony is performed. As they do for all public gatherings, men and women go separately; the women, in groups formed into single files according to rank, move past the men who are seated on the ground near the entrance to the compound. The ground millet flour and other foods received at this time as gifts allow the wife to prepare her husband’s food during her confinement without engaging in a most arduous part of her work—that of grinding the millet into flour. Inside the compound the women sit in front of the mother’s hut chatting gaily and coloring their teeth with tobacco flowers and a local plant used specifically for this purpose. The barber and his young assistant or apprentice arrive and cut facemarks on the new-born infant and then remove its uvula. While waiting to carry out this ritual function, the barber and his assistants cut the women’s hair free of charge as a mark of the festiveness of the occasion. The women collect some money for the barber which is given to him after the baby has been successfully incised. The ceremony ends when perfume is passed among the women and all assembled dip their fingers in tiny bottles or a glass, then rub the scent over their neck and hands. Many, however, stay on talking and chatting for several hours before drifting back in small groups to their own compounds.

In front of the compound the men sit on mats. On one side of the gate sit the mallams (religious practitioners) reading from the Koran. On the other side of the infant’s hut are the men of the household sitting in order of seniority with the most senior closest to the door. Next to them are their close friends, relatives, and the highest ranking people in attendance. The rest spread out along the north side of the compound under its front wall and everyone waits for the name to be announced. Every man contributes a small cash gift of two to five shillings, given as a token of friendship and esteem and collected by a close friend of the father of the new child. The money is used to pay the barber and the mallams who say prayers to ensure the safety of the child and his future success.

When the barber has finished his work, the father sends in a friend to tell the women the name he has chosen for the new child. Ideally his friend should return and then announce the name to the men outside, but very often the men are told at the same time. Now the baby is a person; it has a name; its sex is known; it has joined the compound and the community. The senior mallam leads everyone in a prayer and the ceremony is over. Kola nuts and perfume are passed around among the men and the new father gives a few pennies to each reader of the Koran and several shillings to the senior mallam . It is a memorable day for the parents and there is general rejoicing among those who know about the ceremony and are related in some way to the family. One informant put it this way:

Everyone is happy because the father and mother have shown that they have practiced the customs of our people, and they have shown that they have been blessed with good fortune because “the little kitten” has become a person.

Especially pleased on such occasions is the namesake of the new baby, if he is alive, for it is a public recognition of the respect and affection shown to this person by the family. Very often the name used is that of the grandparent. The Kanuri very often take turns using grandparent’s names on both sides of the family although some insist that boys be named from the father’s side and girls from the mother’s. However, parents may also name children after an important person or a person to whom the father owes some subordination. The Kanuri, like people in many places, avoid using the names of their own parents or parents-in-law and high status or elderly people in general. Therefore the child is given a nickname that often indicates his or her relationship to the person whose name he bears. For example, many Kanuri boys are named Abba Gana (small father) or simply Abba (father) indicating that they have been named after the father of one of their parents. The link to the grandparent is even closer if the latter has been named after his grandparent making him a person who is called Abba Gana as well. Thus the grandson can, in practice, share both his grandfather’s “real” name and his nickname as well. Sometimes the mother is referred to in a name, or even the order of one’s birth in relation to other children. Thus two of the contemporary sons of the royal family in Bornu are called Abba Kiari Kura and Abba Kiari Shuwa. These men are half brothers named after their royal grandfather—Kiari. Indeed Kiari itself is a circumlocution meaning “old” or “the old one.” Kura means “the big one” or “the oldest brother,” and Shuwa refers to the tribal membership of Abba Kiari Shuwa’s mother. Thus one son, Abba Kiari Kura, is called “father, the old one, the eldest,” or “the eldest one named after my father, the old one,” and the other brother, Abba Kiari Shuwa, is “father, the old one, the Shuwa,” or the “son of the Shuwa wife who is named after my father, the old one.” Abba Kiari’s real name, Mustafa, never appears in these well-known names of his grandsons who are his recognized namesakes. Sometimes a name reflects the title of the person that the child is named after. Thus Mallam Kumbar refers to the title of the particular person’s grandfather, who was Kumbar in the court of the king. Or again, sometimes it refers to a family event, such as Gambo, “the person who was born after twins.” Names, then, reflect many of the social relationships and social circumstances of the individual being named and his relationship to those around him. However, the main point of the naming ceremony is quite clear. As one Kanuri put it,

We celebrate the naming because the child and the family are fortunate; the infant has escaped death and entered successfully into life; it is therefore a joyful occasion.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual227,Death Ceremony,"The ceremony itself is quite simple. The body is washed, wrapped in a white cloth and placed on a bier, and then taken out to the burial grounds by the men. Prayers are said continually and the family mourns officially for forty days by saying special prayers and remaining close to home. During the ceremony men remain impassive, quietly telling their beads and praying softly to themselves. Women, on the other hand, come in groups walking slowly in single file wailing and crying, especially if the deceased is a close neighbor, friend, or relative. If a man is needed for a short communication, a woman might stop wailing suddenly, talk in an ordinary voice, then just as quickly resume her keening. A few women at every funeral were observed who were much more totally involved and did not break up their wailing when asked to do something else. Sometimes these wails of the women become songs with words. This is less true at funerals of men where if it happens the song or chant says over and over again, “He was a good man.” For a dead woman the words are also, “She was a good woman,” but an added verse, especially if the dead woman was not very old, refers to the hard life of a woman and how long and unending are her chores. There is a definite implication here that the heavy burdens of womanhood can bring an early death.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual228,"Ngumri Ashembe, End of Ramadan","As the sun set on Tuesday, April 30th, everyone looked closely for the new moon which would mark the beginning of the new month and the end of the fast. The sky was slightly cloudy and the silver of the new moon could not be distinguished. The following day, therefore, would once again be a fast day. However, two boys came to the Alkali and swore on the Koran that they had seen the moon. In addition, it was announced over the radio that the moon had been seen in Enugu, so that the fast of Ramadan was in fact ended. Wednesday, instead of a fast day, was the festive Ngum[unknown]ri Ashembe ( Ashem means fast), the great festival marking the end of Ramadan. Throughout the night guns were shot off, and drumming and algator (a reed instrument) playing were continuous at the door of the Ajari. On Wednesday morning at nine o’clock a crowd of more than a thousand people gathered in an open area to the southeast of the town, where a large tent had been erected, for communal prayers. Everyone wore new gowns (kulugu) which had been given as presents for the holiday. The Ajia rode out to the place of prayer on horse, followed by all his men in their most brilliant robes. After the prayers, led by the Liman Ngum[unknown]ribe, had ended, all strolled back to the town, and the Ajia and his men paraded back to the Ajari. At the chinna of the Ajari a large crowd had gathered, and the Alkali along with the various NA Malams were seated in chairs. The Ajia followed by his men then paraded the length of the dandal to the Ajari entrance. This they did twice, then Yerima Mustapha remained seated at the entrance while his kabuna rode in waves toward the Ajari holding aloft their swords and spears in salute to him. The crowd then dispersed and people dressed in fine robes visited one another and exchanged greetings. Later that evening horsemen rode once again in salute on the dandal; this time the kabuna were joined by a number of townspeople.

On the second day of Ngum[unknown]ri Ashembe an enormous feast, attended by about three hundred people, was held at the Ajari at eight in the morning. Some two hundred and fifty people were seated in the outermost courtyard of the Ajari. These included the kabuna, the more important of the Koranic Malams of the town, and a number of the important traders, many of the latter Hausa. In an inner chamber were the thirty-one members of the NA staff. At one end of the inner chamber, on a raised section sat the Ajia along with the Alkali, the Chief Scribe, the Treasurer, a representative of the Shehu, and Malam Jalo. After a time, the group in the inner chamber made up of the NA staff moved to an inner courtyard, split up into six smaller groups, and food was brought out. In the inner courtyard pancakes ( senasen ) were served, followed by rice b[unknown]ri (porridge), whole roast chickens, and large sections of ram roasted in a hole in the earth. Orange squash was drunk with the meal itself. After the meal, kola nuts were distributed, and after all had washed, perfume was passed around. Lastly, prayers were said, and all rose, said “Allah ngub[unknown]ro” (literally meaning, “May Allah prolong your days”--the traditional phrase of deference said to men of higher status) to Yerima, and left. Throughout this time, bowls of food were sent out to the large group of men gathered in the outermost courtyard, and eighty additional bowls, each sufficient to feed four or five people, were distributed to families in the town. In all, 108 bowls of b[unknown]ari, each costing about 2 shillings, were given away by the Ajia. Mass distribution of food in this manner is done three times each year, at Ngum[unknown]ri Ashembe, at Ngum[unknown]ri Layabe, and at Mamaludu Kuguibe. In a small town which has no Ajia, the Lowan distributes food to all the families of the town. In Geidam only the Ajia distributes food in this manner, although the Alkali also gives away a great deal on a smaller scale. In Maiduguri the Shehu and the Waziri both distribute great quantities of food, while the Ajia of Maiduguri does not.

That evening about thirty-five people were invited to a second feast at the house of Alkali Baba Kura. The meal itself was essentially the same as that at the Ajia’s, except that Krola (a Nigerian imitation of Coca-Cola) was served instead of Orange squash and clear mints were passed around with the kola nuts. Though the feast itself was traditional in every respect, the manner of invitation was not. A list, headed by the writer referred to locally as Malam Ibrahim), was sent to all who were invited to attend. The group was made up largely of the NA Malams, the two Kanuri Lowans and the two most important kabuna, one Kanuri and two Hausa traders, and a few others. Not present were Yerima Mustapha, who is too important a man to eat at another’s house, any of the Limans or important Koranic Malams, the Hausa Lowan or the deposed Lowan Kagu, any craft heads, and most of the important traders. Eating from one bowl at the head group were, in addition to the Alkali, the Chief Scribe, the Treasurer, Malam Jalo, Sidi Mohammad, and the writer.

Celebration of the festival marking the end of Ramadan, Ngum[unknown]ri Ashembe, has been described in some detail above. In the description can be seen the integration of a religious festival with the social structure of the town of Geidam. Keeping of the fast is observed by the entire community and serves to bind its members through a ritual of suffering. The communal bond is further strengthened by public prayer marking the end of the fast. The roles of various office-holders can be seen in connection with these observances. The Liman leads the public prayers; the Alkali attests to the sighting of the new moon; and the Ajia more than any other person uses the festival celebrations to demonstrate and to validate his high status and his great power. The day of Ngum[unknown]ri Ashembe is marked by horse displays in which the kabuna of the Ajia vow their allegiance to him, before large crowds of admiring towns-people. On the following day all the important men of the town are invited to a great feast at the Ajari, and vast quantities of food are distributed by the Ajia who demonstrates the generosity expected of a great Kanuri aristocrat and receives the deferential courtesies owed to a great man. The feast which the Alkali makes is minor in comparison and is limited solely to the town aristocracy and the NA Malams.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Ritual229,Ngumri Laya (or Salla Laya),"Another extremely important yearly festival is called Ngum[unknown]ri Laya or Salla Laya. This is the festival at which sacrifice of a ram is made, corresponding to the Hebrew festival of Pesach and the Christian Easter. Salla Laya was celebrated on July 9, 1957. The first ram sacrificed is the Shehu’s ram in Maiduguri, a special ram with black rings about his eyes. In Maiduguri a great festival marked by communal prayer attended by the Shehu accompanies the sacrifice of this, the first ram. The Liman says the words “Bismillahi” (in the name of Allah) as he cuts the ram’s throat, and the blood pours into a basin or shallow hole. In Maiduguri people rushed forward to dip their fingers into the blood and transfer it onto their face, as the blood is considered blessed. After the Shehu’s ram has been sacrificed, rich men return to their homes and sacrifice their own rams. The meat is then distributed to the poor, and the people of one’s ward. In Geidam Yerima Mustapha distributes about a dozen rams to other important people. In 1957 this included the visiting anthropologist, who had the ram sacrificed appropriately by a neighboring Malam, and distributed the meat as sadaka to his neighbors and the people of his ward.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Ritual230,Wedding,"The girl is represented by her luwali in arranging a marriage. The luwali may be a relative or friend of the girl, but not her father (except in the case of a sadaka marriage noted above). The luwali states the amount of the luwaliram. The bridegroom may also be represented by someone, or he may make his own arrangements. The bridegroom, or his representative, may accept the stated price, or he may bargain for a lower price. The luwaliram is given to the luwali, who in turn passes it to the girl’s father. The girl’s father gives a token fee to the luwali, gives presents to the groom which include both money and clothing, and gives his daughter household utensils and jewelry.

At the time of marriage, an additional payment, s[unknown]dagu (Arabic, sadak), is made. S[unknown]dagu is paid in the form of Maria Theresa dollars, two to five being the average amount of s[unknown]dagu payment, though now eight shillings may be substituted for each Maria Theresa dollar. The size of the s[unknown]dagu is arranged for before the marriage, and initial payment of part of the s[unknown]dagu may be made before the marriage. Should a couple divorce before the entire s[unknown]dagu has been paid, the difference must be paid at the time of divorce.

Finally, in addition to both luwaliram and s[unknown]dagu, there is still a third type of payment, called m[unknown]ri, which must be paid before the marriage or it is not a legal marriage. Mori, too, can vary in size, but it is the smallest of the three payments, and usually amounts to several shillings.

The wedding itself is very brief. It is presided over by a Malam, before many witnesses. The Malam asks the names of bride and bridegroom, asks them if they wish to marry, reads a section of the Koran. Then all pray, and the ceremony is ended as kola nuts ( goro ) are distributed to all present, and gifts are given to Malam and luwali. That evening, the husband’s closest friends come to the bride’s house to take her to the house of her husband. While her friends cry and try to hold her back, the husband’s friends take the bride off by horse, and leave her at her husband’s house. One friend of the girl refuses to leave her until the husband pays fugurum (or ferorum), which is the set amount of thirty shillings, alike for rich and poor. Fugu means hymen. The friend keeps several shillings of the fugurum for herself and gives the remainder to the mother of the bride, payment to her for protecting her daughter’s virtue.

Virginity of the girl is attested to by blood stains on a white blanket which has been spread on the wedding bed. The blood-stained blanket is taken from the room the following morning by friends of the girl and brought to her mother. If it is stained, mother praises daughter, and her friends parade it throughout the neighborhood. If it is not stained, the girl is cursed by all. If the husband finds that his bride is not a virgin, he beats her that night, and proclaims it openly. Both the girl and her mother feel shame; the husband, in turn, feels that he has been defrauded and has gotten a bad bargain. The fugurum money, however, is not repaid him. Though the Kanuri know that the hymen may be removed surgically, and that the Arabs do do this in order to make the wedding night less painful to the bride, they never do it themselves; the hymen is always forcefully broken.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual231,Candomblé Possession Cult,"The Cult and Ritual of Candomblé

Candomblé, the center of which is the state of Bahia, is one form of the Afro-Brazilian religious cults based on the beliefs and rituals brought to Brazil with the slaves, but recreated in Brazil, and mixed with Catholicism and belief in Indian spirits. Another form, Umbanda is also influenced by spiritism and French Kardecist philosophy. These cults are now flourishing all over Brazil and gaining increasing influence in many big cities. Candomblé is usually referred to as the most traditional and orthodox cult, and the one most faithful to the African tradition, as distinguished from the more modern Umbanda. Candomblé is divided into different nations (Nagô, Ketu, Gege, Angola among others) supposedly related to the areas in Africa that the slaves came from. In the contemporary use of these terms, however, the central point lies not in the relationship of one nation or another to historical facts. An understanding of one of the episodes requires some further clarification of the way the concepts of nations are used by the people in Candomblé. This has been discussed recently in an interesting study by Dantas who — speaking of the “myth of Africanism” on the basis of a study in the state of Sergipe — states that two terms are applied by the cult houses: nagô and toré. Nagô, designating the religious practice of Yoruba origin, is a term also very much used by the cult houses in Bahia. In Dantas’ words, it designates “the pure African tradition”, while toré is a pejorative term, standing for Candomblé mixed with Caboclos (Indian spirits). In general toré designates Candomblé houses of African origin, which have been mixed with other cultural traditions (Dantas 1982:16). In Cachoeira, there is not quite as clear a distinction between “pure nagô” and other nations, and the term toré is not in common use here. To a certain extent, however, the term Umbanda is used in a derogative sense, designating houses that mix other cultural elements into the African tradition. The fact that the majority of terreiros (cult houses) do that, does not prevent the existence of the myth of Africanism and purity, and what Dantas has to say about this could also go for the way the concept of nation is used in Cachoeira:

It seems to me that “pure nagô”, just like ethnicity would be a native category used by the terreiros to mark their differences and express rivalries, which are accentuated as the different religious forms are organized as agencies in a market competing for symbolic goods. (Dantas 1982:17).

Candomblé is practised in the terreiros (terreiro literally means a piece of land), most of which are situated in the periphery, and the poorest parts of the cities. The cult house, which is often just an ordinary house or an addition to a family house, is the center of activities involving offerings to Orixás, the African gods, and consultations by the mãe- or pãe-de-santo (cult leaders, respectively mother or father of saints). They are also the places where the regular ritual festas take place. During the ritual the Orixás, the male and female African gods, are called to “descend” by the drums, and they will come forth and take possession of their mediums: women and men initiated to receive a specific Orixá. Women are predominant in the cult, as mediums, although there seem to be an increasing number of male cult leaders.

Initiation into Candomblé is ideally a long and complicated process, the purpose of which is to fazer a cabeça (form the head) of the medium. Only after being initiated can a person receive his or her Orixá in the highly structured and controlled manner which is the ideal, and which is required in ritual. In the terreiros where I followed the initiation process, it lasted three months, but the duration varies from one terreiro to the other. In a sense initiation is a lifelong process, the increasing access to the esoteric (African) knowledge that constitutes the basis for the rituals performed being the sign of ascendancy in the spiritual hierarchy. This hierarchy is highly specified, and a person ascends within it through time, and by completing offerings to his or her god every year, with major offerings completed every seventh year. The state of possession or trance implies a knowledge of specified rules of conduct, ways of dancing etc conforming to the role and character of the Orixá who is the dono da cabeça, (master of the head). The whole phenomenon of trance and role performance in connection with trance is as complicated as the rest of Candomblé. Suffice it to say for our present purpose that there is a relation between position in hierarchy and the degree of control in connection with trance. The first time a medium falls into trance, it can be in a very uncontrolled manner. At the other end of the hierarchical scale the leader of a terreiro, the mãe- or pãe-de-santo, who has been initiated for many years, is in a high degree of control of his or her relationship with the Orixá, and is supposedly able to call forth and send away the Orixá voluntarily.

All mediums at any place in the hierarchy, however, will maintain that possession is the tool of the will to the Orixá, and when a person is in trance, he or she is not in his/her normal state of consciousness. The medium as a person will not be aware of what is going on while incorporated with the Orixá.

Thus, on the one hand there is the requirement of a high degree of control, and the concept of força, strength, spiritual intensity of the relationship with the Orixá, implying both knowledge and the ritual and spiritual mastering of conduct, which comes with age, i.e. time within the cult. On the other hand there is the concept of every medium being the tool of the will of the Orixá, and força being linked to the Orixá’s supernatural power.

There is a certain contradiction in this. The Orixás decide, and still their behavior must be controlled, learned. A person who does not submit to the will of the Orixá runs the risk of madness, and even death (Velho 1975). Yet, a person cannot submit to the will of the god at any time or any place. At least in an etic sense, one may say so. In an emic sense, the conviction is that the Orixás do not arrive except when they are properly called in the ritual way. In a Durkheimian sense the belief in the gods is the belief in ritual. In an emic sense the force of the gods, the axé ( força in Portuguese) is related to the concept of mana (Bastide 1978), and the concept has to do with the boundless, unlimited supernatural strength and power of the Orixás who are the masters of natural elements, like the woods ( Oxóssi), the rivers ( Oxum), the sea ( Iemanjá), and iron ( Ogum).

I shall come back to this, which I consider an essential contradiction in the Candomblé, and try to show how it relates to the manipulations, interpretations and options in ritual. First, however, I shall describe the two episodes that from the basis for reflection upon ritual, rules and deviance.

The Untimely God

One of the first Candomblé rituals I observed was in Dona Felina’s terreiro in Cachoeira. On the first Saturday night after my arrival in town, two young fellows who were hanging out in the central square, invited me to go with them to the Candomblé at Dona Felina’s house on the outskirts of the town. One of the young men, Milton, was particularly interested in talking to me. While we walked the long way out to the terreiro, he did not stop talking about himself and his spirits. He was a tall and bony young man with an eager and somewhat nervous expression, and he told me with great enthusiasm that he was sure to become the youngest pãe-de-santo ever to have opened his own terreiro, which he was just about ready to do, because he had “so much spirit”.

Milton told me there was a “war of Orixá” going on in his head. I was particularly interested in this concept, which I had recently discussed with another medium in the Bahian capital Salvador. She had referred to it as having to do with an identity conflict in a medium, who was being incorporated with more than one Orixá, both or all Orixás wanting to be “master of the head”. Her definition of the concept guerra de Orixá (war of Orixá) diverged from the one employed in a study by Yvonne Velh˙o, of an Umbanda terreiro in Rio de Janeiro (Velho 1975). In this guerra de Orixá referred to a struggle between two mediums.  

My informant in Salvador had read Yvonne Velho’s book, and did not agree with her definition of the concept, a fact which made the whole subject the more interesting to me. In any case the concept has to do with identity and conflict on both the psychological and social level, and it was just in the line of my theoretical interest. I was therefore extremely attentive to Milton’s rather disrupted monologue, trying to make anthropological sense out of his emotional conflict. From the way he talked about his spirits and their fighting over his mind, I knew that in him I had found a perfect “object” for the study of identity and the general psychological importance of the participation in Candomblé, and I could not help feeling a certain thrill at having had such luck, and that he was so eager to talk to me.

We arrived in Dona Felina’s terreiro, and I was introduced to a very thin, serious and intelligent looking man, some forty years old, who presented himself as Dona Felina’s helper in the leadership of the terreiro. Later I learned that he had been initiated when he was very young, but did not receive his Orixá any more. We were seated on a stone bench in the back of the barraçao, the dance room, and I noticed that women and men were not seated separately in this terreiro as was the custom in other terreiros I had visited in Salvador. On the whole there seemed to be a certain carelessness about this house. The women who were supposed to start dancing walked in and out. Some were not yet dressed in the appropriate clothes: saias, long skirts, white laced blouses, turbans and pano da costa, a piece of cloth tied around the torso. There was much laughter and teasing, and the mãe-de-santo, to whom we had not yet been introduced, wa`lked around with an air of indifference, not seeming to be, nor caring about being in control of the situation.

Eventually though, the dance began, and the ritual was conducted in the usual order. It started with the drumming for the gods in a certain sequence, which was to be followed by adarrum, the call for the gods to descend. Usually this would only happen after about two hours of dancing, when the mediums would then begin to fall into trance. This evening, however, something happened after about three quarters of an hour. Milton was sitting next to me, and I sensed that there was something going on with him before I turned my head to see what it was. I felt a chill. In retrospect, analyzing what my feelings were at this precise moment, I have come to the conclusion that they can best be described as feelings of forced intimacy, of being invaded. I felt embarrassed. Although it is hard to exclude the influence of later events on this interpretation, I believe this is what I felt. The chill was real enough. It was like a cold wind suddenly passing through the room.

Milton was uttering strange noises. Struggling against my immediate temptation to move away, I forced myself to turn my head towards him, and I saw Milton showing clear signs of becoming possessed. He was swinging the upper part of his body back and forth, his eyes were closed, and his lips protruded. I knew what was supposed to be done with a medium who falls into trance, but I had no idea what to do in this particular situation. At the same time I felt that Milton, or Milton’s spirit was signalling something, not to just anyone, but to me in particular. I was not able to respond to the signals, and the feeling of embarrassment increased.

The other young man came to help. He rose a little hesitantly, walked over to Milton, and did what one is supposed to do: he took off the medium’s shoes, rolled up his trousers to over the knees, and took away loose objects: some bank notes, cigarettes, lighter and his wrist watch. The medium began walking out on the floor, hands crossed behind his back and head down, and in the swaying way characteristic of trance. The drummers and the dancing women, none of whom were yet in trance, at first paid no attention to him, but it soon became impossible to ignore what was going on. Milton walked out into the middle of the circle of the dancing women, and uttered the characteristic growling sounds, accompanied by shaking movements of the upper part of his body: the greetings of the Orixá Ogum. The drummers stopped their drumming. Obviously Ogum was there, and normally the drummers would respect the presence of an Orixá, and start drumming the rhythm to accompany his dance. The drummers looked at each other, but they did not start drumming. The dancing women walked aside and stood there, giggling and not quite knowing what to do. “What kind of Ogum is this?” I heard someone whisper, and there was more giggling. Dona Felina, the mãe-de-santo and the person supposed to be in charge of the ritual performance, was nowhere to be seen.

The Orixá Ogum repeated his salutary movements, and then repeated them again, a little impatiently, as there were still no signs of anyone starting the drumming for Ogum. It was very clear by now that I was not the only one feeling uneasy. Everyone looked around for help, for some sign of what was to be done, and finally Arnol, the helper, appeared in the dance hall. He took one look at the scene, then walked up to the Orixá/Milton, whispered something in his ear, and lead him out of the hall in the usual gentle way of leading Orixás to and from the dance hall. Milton, still possessed, was taken to the secluded room where Orixás are dressed before dancing, and “sent away” when they have finished their performance. I was not able to see what happened there, nor hear what was said. The drummers and the dancers continued, following the normal ritual procedure. Some time later Milton came back, now out of trance. Arnol gave him back his cigarettes, wrist watch etc, and he sat down next to me again, not uttering a word, nor seeming to be in the mood for questions. The dance went on, and eventually several Orixás appeared, including an Ogum. Milton’s Orixá, though, did not manifest itself again that night.

Now this little event could easily be brushed aside as just one of those little breaks from ritual procedure that happen all the time. A break which was handled efficiently by one of the authorities in charge of the ritual, who soon put things back into order. When I later made inquiries to get some comments on the scene from Milton, Arnol and Dona Felina, I did not, in fact, get very far. Dona Felina claimed she had not seen what was going on, and she may not have, although knowing her, I am not convinced. In any case she refused to talk about it, also after having had the situation described to her. Milton was still eager to talk, but preferred talking about other things. Explanations on the subject of trance are, in any case, not likely to come from the person who has been possessed. His answer to anything involving this situation was likely to be that it was the will of the Orixá. My communication with Milton was furthermore made difficult by another fact, to which I shall soon return.

Arnol was the best source of information, although he was much more interested in presenting the story of his own career in Candomblé than in discussing the embarrassing episode. As far as he was concerned, there was not much to say beyond the answer to my obvious question: What did he whisper in the Orixá’s, in Milton’s, ear before he lead him off the dance floor? To this he answered that he had said that Milton’s Orixá was of another nation than the nation of Dona Felina’s house, and consequently his Orixá could not dance here.

The answer is almost as obvious as the question, and I found it hard to push the matter much further. From Arnol’s and the others’ point of view there really was not much more to be said. Apart from the fact that a situation which, if my perception of the scene was correct, had embarrassed everybody, never would be the most popular subject to be discussed with a first time visitor, Arnol had established the fact that Milton’s Orixá was of another nation, and that was it. He had even said the “nation of Umbanda”, and Felina’s terreiro is Nagô-vodunsi. The two do not combine, as everyone knows, and that was all there was to it.

Even so the scene seems to require some clarification. Why the emotional reaction on my part? Why was it that later I saw plenty of deviances from ritual, not causing embarrassment, although being commented on and sometimes causing conflicts among the participants?

To arrive at an explanation I shall use the concepts framing and keying. Goffman defines frame in the following way: “I assume that definitions of a situation are built up in accordance with principles of organization which govern events — at least social ones — and our subjective involvement in them; frame is the word I use to refer to such of these basic elements as I am able to identify” (Goffman 1986:10-11). Keying which according to Goffman is a central concept in frame analysis is “the set of conventions by which a given activity, one already meaningful in terms of some primary framework, is transformed into something patterned on this activity but seen by the participants to be something quite else” (Goffman 1986:44).

The central moment in the ritual of Candomblé - the ritual in itself being conducted in a certain key - is the moment when ordinary people, factory workers, street cleaners, taxi drivers, maids etc are transformed into gods: Ogum, Iemanjá, Oxóssi and Oxum. This moment can be regarded as a transformation in key, as defined by Goffman; and within the ritual, cues are consequently available “for establishing when the transformation is to begin and when it is to end, namely brackets in time, within which and to which the transformation is to be restricted”. Special brackets in time are also implied as determinant of “within which and nowhere outside of which the keying applies on that occasion” (Goffman 1986:45).

In Candomblé the main cues are the drumming and the sequential timing. There is a possibility that Arnol would not have interpreted Milton’s Orixá to be of the Umbanda nation, if it had chosen to manifest itself two hours later. Keying performs a crucial role in determining what we think is going on, says Goffman. Milton was, as the recipient of a god that was not welcome at that particular moment, “out of key”.

The episode requires explanations of three kinds. An emic one, that is an explanation within the conceptual universe of the participants involved, an etic one, for which the above-mentioned concepts as defined by Goffman are useful, and a third one which for our present purpose can be named an explanation of the total experience.

Milton’s own experience of what had happened would without doubt refer to the extreme força of his Orixá. He would refer to the situation involving his Orixá Ogum taking possession of him at this early stage of the ritual as real, and would, I suspect from the way he had described his spirits, see it as a token of his importance as a medium, and of the boundless force of his Orixá. In this sense he would be responding to one aspect of the concept of força, the one which has to do with the supernatural power and the unavoidable will of the Orixá. Thereby, however, he came into conflict with the aspect that emphasizes the correct ritual procedure as a sign of the força of Candomblé.

From an etic point of view Milton was trying to define the situation. But he did not succeed in convincing the others present of his definition by persuading them to understand and accept the importance and force of his Orixá. To himself it was real, but as Goffman says, “defining situations as real certainly has consequences, but these may contribute very marginally to the events in progress; in some cases only a slight embarrassment flits across the scene in mild concern for those who tried to define the situation wrongly” (Goffman 1986:1). A slight embarrassment flitting across the scene is a very accurate description of what happened in this situation, and it was followed by the diffuse disorder which according to Goffman is a frequent result of the experience of deviant acts.

Goffman explains the “issue of frame limits” by calling attention to the laws of pornography, and he exemplifies this by saying that an act which in a certain context is okay, calls forth a feeling of shame in another. For instance, “what is offensive in a movie might not be offensive in a novel” (Goffman 1986:55). The allusion to this particular example by Goffman is no coincidence. Although Milton’s act was in no way pornographic, my own reaction, and if I am not mistaken, the reaction of the others were the same as if it had been. We felt shame. We felt intimidated, and the sense of embarrassment that was caused by this came among other things from the fact that the context was, at this particular moment of time, wrong. If the same kind of feeling had occurred five or six hours later, nothing would have been “out of key”. A Candomblé ritual includes various stages, and there are other gods and spirits aside from those already discussed. Late at night when the solemn part of the ritual is over, and the Orixás have left the scene, another kind of gods, the erês arrive. The erês are the spirits of children, and their role is, among other things, precisely to embarrass people. They surpass personal boundaries of intimacy by offering food they have chewed to people, and by acting and talking obscenely (Trindade-Serra 1978, Sjørslev 1986). The erês - interesting as they may be - do not play a part in our present story. Their role is mentioned here to emphasize the fact that being “in key” or “out of key” has a lot to do with timing. Frame limits do not only determine whether we are offended or not. Some framings are of a kind specifically meant to call attention to our “normal” frames, and in those circumstances, feelings of shame and embarrassment are perfectly in key. This is the case of the erês, but it is certainly not the case of the Orixás.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual231,Candomblé Possession Cult,"African Cults

Brazilian candomblé is usually thought of as a syncretism between African cultism and Catholicism. There has been a partial identification of the African deities with Catholic saints. For example, Ôgún, the African god of war, has been identified with St. Anthony; Ôxóssi, deity of the hunt, with St. George; Ômolú, the god of pestilence, with St. Roch; Êxu, the trickster, with Satan; Yansan, with St. Barbara; and Xangô, with either St. Jerome or St. Barbara. There has been some confusion in the minds of the cultists themselves as to exactly which saint an African spirit represents, and there often are slight differences in interpretation which do not, however, upset the cult practices to any great extent. Cultism in Brazil has been described in detail by Nina Rodrigues, Arthur Ramos, and Edison Carneiro, and by the Americans Donald Pierson and Ruth Landes, all of whom concentrated on cultism in the city of Salvador; Eduardo Octavio da Costa has good material on urban-rural cultism in Maranhão (northern Brazil). In Vila Recôncavo the syncretisms are being forgotten as the content of cults changes from African spirits to the Indian spirits, for which no identification is made with the Catholic saints.

Cultism apparently got its start in Bahia in the early nineteenth century. Carneiro sets the date for the establishment of the first cult house in the city as 1838. Old people in Vila Recôncavo do not remember cultism beyond two generations ago. There is one woman in town who is in her late nineties and who only remembers hearing of her mother and her mother’s generation as active in cults. Apparently the force of cultism increased with the decrease in Catholic proselytization, as the number of priests in the rural areas diminished. It also increased in tempo with the manumission of slaves, and apparently was one of the institutions through which former slaves bought the freedom of other slaves.

Today the cults of the rural area are far less elaborate than those in the city of Salvador, although it seems that even in the city, cultism is showing the same general trend toward disintegration which is so strongly apparent in the rural area. In both places there is a shift away from African ritual to practices connected with the Indian spirits, whose demands are easier to understand and to comply with. In the town of Vila Recôncavo there are two houses of cult activities with female leaders, and in the rural area there is one such house with a male leader. These are the three houses which were studied by the author. There are six more in the area, but they are much smaller and poorer than these three.

One of the three is led by a woman almost a hundred years old. She is now completely blind and can barely walk about the house. She has not been outside of it for several years. She has an assistant, a young man in his twenties, who as a child brought her firewood and water and who now has been taught by her much of the cult ritual. The house is now inactive, for the old woman has outlived her former followers, or else they have moved away. The room which contains the insignia of the African spirits is still kept up, and the proper foods and drinks are always placed there by the young man, in accordance with the instructions of the old lady. She herself does little, although she still consults the spirits by throwing cowrie shells. Her fame as a cult leader is widespread, and people still come to her for help, but she is too feeble to do much. In her day she was a “purist” and went through the long training period necessary to become a devotee and later a cult leader. She still knows a few words of Nagó, the Yoruban language, and laments the passing of her generation, with whom she says she conversed only in this language. Several of her initiates broke away and started their own houses in other places, although according to her they were not ready to assume leadership since they did not know enough of the mysteries.

The other two houses studied are led by disciples of one of the old woman’s devotees who broke away. There is no contact among the three, although the two younger leaders are in awe of the old woman, aware that she knows much more than they do and that in her eyes they are only upstarts, manipulating something mystical which they are not sufficiently prepared to control. She does not intimidate them, however, and now ignores their activities, since they both have recently accepted the Indian spirits which the old woman feels are bogus. She is more interested in passing on her knowledge to the young man who cares for her house, though she complains that he is too indifferent to her teachings. He is learning a great deal, however, though he has not yet “made” his saint, that is, he is not yet a full-fledged devotee. Preparations for this are being made, however, and it is hoped he will be ready for it before her death. In the meantime she has legally willed the house and its material belongings to him, and is also passing along to him her spiritual heritage. He is learning the mystical part of the cult, but she cannot show him the outer forms, such as dancing and other physical motions of worship, because she is too infirm. Traditionally only women went through training for worship in the Brazilian cults, for the belief is that the gods descend and “ride” or “mount” the disciple. This could only be done with women disciples. However, one of the changes reaching the cults now is the entrance of men as devotees. Very often they are effeminate, as is the case with the young man who is helping the old woman. The old one is not pleased with having a man perform the duties of her cult house, but she feels she must be satisfied with him because there is no one else in her house. Although all her former disciples are gone, now at least she will have someone to dispatch her saints when she dies, a complicated ritual which must be properly carried out.

One of the other two houses is in the town and is led by Roxa, who has “made her saint” but who by cult standards should still be a devotee in another house, for she is not considered well enough prepared to be leading a house of her own. Her house is extremely weak, with few followers, most of whom have not yet “made their saints.” Roxa is the main figure, the one most often possessed and through whom the spirits speak. As a young girl she went through a fairly rigorous period of training, but broke away before it was completed. She says she fulfills the necessary obligations now only because if she did not she would become sick. She calls the whole thing a “complication” in her life which must be looked after. She has been married but is now widowed and childless.

The other house, located on one of the plantations run by an overseer, is led by a man in his forties. He also claims that he is in the cult because of his health. As a boy and young man he was always sick and his entire body ached. One day in the field he found a “lightning stone” ( pedra de raio). Such stones are common in the cults and are thought to have been sent from the sky, although they really are American Indian artifacts, such as arrowheads and hatchets, and are constantly turned up in the soil. At first he did not know what the stone was and took it home, but on discovering that it had supernatural significance, he threw it away, for he wanted nothing to do with cultism. His parents were strongly opposed to cultism and had told him that it was bad. But the next day the stone was back in his house, frightening him. He again threw it away, and again it reappeared in his house. Then he took it to the cult leader on the plantation, who told him that it was a sign that he had an obligation to fulfill toward the gods. To put an end to the matter, it was necessary to make certain appeasements in the form of food and drink. So he began to save money, and at the same time took instruction from the woman as to what to do. During this time he became genuinely interested in cultism and became the “most curious” of the woman’s disciples. He studied for many years with her and did as much as he could in the ceremonies. When she died she left the house to him, as he was the most active among her followers. After he had observed the honorary period of a year after her death and had properly dispatched her saints, he moved into the house where he has now been leader for thirteen years. Because of jealousies and fights over the inheritance, many of the devotees broke away and went to other houses, taking their saints with them.

Three years after he had taken over the house, he had his first experience with the Indian spirit Seven Stars, who came to him in a dream and let it be known that he wanted to enter the man and become part of the cult. For some time the man resisted, for the cult was traditionally Nagó and the former leader would have had nothing to do with Indian spirits. Seven Stars, however, threatened him with extinction if he did not comply, so in the end he gave in, and one night during a ceremony was possessed by Seven Stars. Everyone liked Seven Stars, because he was a very happy and gay spirit and danced well. After this many other devotees in the house were also possessed by this as well as by one or two other Indian spirits, neither of which, however, was considered as nice as Seven Stars.

According to dogma, there are twenty-one Indian spirits, although the informant could not name them all and neither could anyone else. All twenty-one live in an aldeia (village) in the woods. There was nothing in the African tradition to tell what preparation was necessary for these spirits, so the entire ritual became one of inventiveness and propitiousness. Nowadays young people who enter the cults are nearly always taken by an Indian spirit and are much pleased, for these spirits involve less expense and much less work. The major complaint about African deities is the amount of work involved and the great expense entailed by making the proper clothes and buying the beads and bracelets. All leaders say that no one can afford traditional spirits these days. Those who had formerly had them, of course, still do, but have also been visited by Indian spirits which they much prefer. So they carry out the more fundamental obligations toward the African spirits, such as providing food and drink, but they dress and dance for their Indian spirits. The result has been a confusion of rituals--the use of African music and incantations and the addition of new dances, costumes, and foods appropriate for the simpler tastes of the Indian spirits.

The cult houses ( terreiros) are built like other houses in the community. The active one in town is located on a street in line with all the other houses, while that on the plantation is set slightly apart from the others, because of the scattered configuration of the village. The front room, which is the largest, is usually bare except for a few long wooden benches and a small altar with pictures of the patron saints of the cult leader and of several of the cult members. This room is decorated with crepe paper streamers and paper flowers; the dances are held here. The other rooms of the house consist of a bedroom, a dining room, a kitchen, and another room known as the pegi, which houses the African altar with its plants and leaves, dishes, bottles, cups, and glasses of food and drink for the spirits, as well as the symbol of each one of them, such as a spade, a sword, or a hatchet. In this room there is also usually a trunk containing the ceremonial paraphernalia used during the festivities, such as the dress and headdress of each spirit. This is the room in which sacrificial killings ( matanças) are made of the goats and chickens used during the ceremonies. In the rural house there are also pictures of Catholic saints in the pegi, another departure from the older traditional houses where such a thing would never occur.

The cult leader lives in the cult house. In the literature on candomblé the cult leader is usually referred to as the mae, or pai, de santo, which means literally “mother (or father) of the saints.” None of the cult leaders in Vila Recôncavo likes this term; they say they could not possibly be the mother or father of the divine beings. They consider themselves rather zeladores, that is, caretakers of the saints on earth. There is much the same complaint about the term filha, or filho, santo, which means literally “daughter (or son) of the saint.” They prefer to refer to a person as “having a saint” ( tem santo) which indicates that he has an obligation toward one of the saints and becomes possessed by him. In ordinary speech the word “saint” is used, but once the person has “made his saint” --that is, has gone through the preparatory rites and has learned the cries and dances of the divinity and how to care for him properly--it is said that the person has Ômolú, or Sete Estrelas (Seven Stars).

Because most of the women, and the few men in the cults, cannot spend a year segregated in the cult house in order to “make their saint,” they continue for many years in the halfway condition of someone who “has a saint but has not yet made the saint.” This means that the person has experienced possession, and that it has been determined by the zelador that he is under obligation to a certain saint and is in the process of “making the saint.” During this period of simply “having the saint,” the person has to carry out certain duties such as feeding the saint, making the proper clothes, and buying the beads and other outer symbols of the deity which are to be used during the ceremonies. This involves considerable expenditure. The clothes are always made of silk, since nothing is too good for the saint. Today, lipstick, perfume, and cheap jewelry are competing for the few extra cents the girls have, so that it takes longer and longer to get the necessary items together. During this period, the obligations of dancing and possession are less strenuous. In the case of the Indian spirits, the deity often speaks through the person after one or two possessions, and this is taken to mean that the spirit is firmly upon the person and may be considered “made.” In this fashion much arduous work is avoided, as well as considerable expense. This is a major reason for the growing popularity of the Indian saints, in addition to the fact that they are gayer.

The drummers also like Indian saints, for, after they have danced, the Indian spirits usually take up a collection which is presented to the drummers for having played so well for them. The drummers are drawn from men whose wives participate in the activities, or else they are men who are interested in the proceedings and who like to drum. They learn the drumming early in their lives, listening to it as children when they go to watch the ceremonies. On nights when the drums are playing it is impossible for anyone not to hear the imposing, exciting sounds, which continue for hours on end. Little boys pick up the rhythms quickly and soon associate each rhythm with the particular spirit who dances to it. As they grow older and show interest in it, they may be allowed to relieve one of the drummers during an interval and in this way join the others in some less important part of the ceremony, until finally the zelador feels they know enough to drum for the entire evening.

The entire proceedings are considered too strenuous for children, as much for the boy drummers as for the girl dancers. If a small girl shows signs of possession during the ceremony she is taken away, for until she is over fourteen dancing is considered too strenuous for her. But unless her family refuses, she may be coached in all the rituals by the other dancers and the zelador. The ceremonies always draw more onlookers than performers, and outside the rural cult house a man has set up a small stand to sell refreshments. As many as can, enter the room and line the walls, while the others stand outside, looking in through the open doors and windows. Most people know the procedure in a vague way and know whom the drums are calling and who “has” which saint.

The ceremonies are rather long, the first step in the actual performance being the calling of the saints. The evening’s participants dance in a circle while the drums call the various spirits. It sometimes takes quite a while for the saint to come, and thére are times when he does not come at all. One young man danced unsuccessfully for over an hour and was finally removed, exhausted, by the zelador. When someone in the circle “falls,” he is quickly led out of the room and into the pegi where the zelador changes his clothing, putting on him the costume of the spirit. In the meantime the others rest or may keep on dancing, becoming possessed one after the other, depending upon the type of ceremony. After the possessed person has been dressed and has completed the necessary ritual, he is led back into the main room where he now, as the saint, dances in earnest until tired or angered by something which occurs in the room. Often the zelador gives the signal for the drums to change their rhythm, indicating the end of the dance, by which time the person is physically very tired although emotionally highly keyed up. He is led back into the pegi to complete the detailed rituals, and is then given a place to rest and to come back to normal. As a rule he soon joins the others in the front room as a spectator. By then the drums are calling the other saints, the circle has been formed again, and the process is repeated. This goes on frequently all night long, ending only with the dawn. The rural cult house has a general ceremony for all the saints of the house during the New Year holiday, and it often takes three or four days and nights of continuous dancing and drumming for all the participants to “fulfill their obligations.” Activities cease for a while during the day while everyone rests, and then pick up again late in the afternoon.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual232,Festivals,"Festivals

The festivals which take place in Vila Recôncavo are based on the religious calendar and are participated in to a great extent by the African cult members. January 1 is an important date in town and is celebrated by a Mass in the fishermen’s chapel, after which the priest goes out on the beach and blesses all the canoes. After he has gone, the participants in African cults make their offering for the day. This is the date when presents are given to the Mother of Waters (Mae d’Agua locally, but sometimes known as Janaina, Sereia, or Yansan in other parts of Brazil). The presentations are made by the cult priestesses, but anyone who wants to give a present to the Mother of Waters may do so by handing the gift to the cult priestess beforehand. The presents may consist of money or of anything a woman can use, as long as it is white: combs, ribbons, powders, perfumes, soaps, flowers, and so on. Everything is wrapped together and placed in a large clay basin covered with white cloths and decked with white flowers.

The cult priestess comes out of the cult house after Mass and, accompanied by participants and onlookers, goes down to the beach and enters one of the large canoes prepared for the occasion. The cult drummers accompany her, as well as most of the female devotees ( filhas de santo). Usually two presents are given, one to the young Mother of Waters, who lives near the town, and another, larger one to the old Mother of Waters, who lives at about an hour’s distance from town, where the water is very deep. The canoes take off and proceed up the river, while the drums beat and the devotees sing. The Mother of Waters is called and praised, and when the canoes arrive where the younger one lives, her present is lowered into the water. If it does not sink it is a very bad sign, for it means that the present was rejected. The bundles usually sink, however, for they are bound in a heavy clay basin. At this moment the Mother of Waters is supposed to enter the body of the person who placed the gift in the water. This person, usually an older devotee, enters a trance state and must be held in the canoe by the others, for she tries to jump into the water. At the same time, all those present in the canoe scoop up the water and pour it over themselves, for it is at this moment quite holy. The possessed person is gradually calmed and brought back to a normal state as the canoes move up the river.

During this time, groups of fishermen often go out in their newly blessed canoes ( canoas de bordejo) to play. Because their canoes have been blessed by the priest, and because of the holy aspect of the water resulting from the presence of the Mother of the Waters, the men may enter the water without fear, so they jump in and out of the water and swim around their canoes until they are tired. This cannot be done at any other time of the year for it is not considered safe to enter deep water.

After the second gift has been offered and accepted, the party lands and goes back to town on foot in a spirit of great joy and gaiety. The rest of the day is given over to horse racing, visiting, gaming, and dancing on the fishermen’s square. People from classes A and B do not participate in these proceedings, which they consider barbarous. But most lower-class people at least watch, although only participants enter the canoes. Observers walk along the banks and watch. Cults from the rural areas make their own presentations separately, frequently on Christmas Day and in another locale.

The next festival in the year comes after January 6, the Day of Kings, which has already been mentioned. Parties take place from this day until the beginning of Lent. Other than a Mass, there is no longer much sanctity connected to this day.

The most important festival of the year is that of Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Praia, the patron saint of most of the fishermen, to whom their chapel is dedicated. This festival begins on January 13 and starts off each evening with a novena held in the fishermen’s chapel. The priest goes each evening for the novena, and, on the three last days of the festival, each morning, to celebrate Mass in honor of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, St. Peter, and St. John. A committee is organized in the chapel to ask patrons for contributions to the festival, for candles, oils, electric light, and to pay the priest each night. Flowers are a very important part of the festival, although at this time of the year they are very expensive. Each night of the novena there is a different group of patrons, and supposedly there is competition among them as to which night will be the loveliest. This becomes more expensive each year, however, and the patrons are becoming less willing to donate money. This festival is most enjoyed by the lower classes. It is avoided by members of Class B, who in many instances are nevertheless called upon to be patrons.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual233,Corn Offering Ritual,"Corn and Meat Offerings

The leading south side priest says, “It is time that we eat.” They place the first kettle between the entrance and the fire with the eight wooden bowls around it (Figure 24). Then follows an elaborate corn-offering ritual in which small particles of the boiled corn are offered to the two outer doorposts, the north one of which is called “chief,” and the south “soldier.” Some is also offered to each of the four inner posts, to the fireplace, etc. Then the corn is dipped out into the eight bowls in the prescribed manner (Murie, 1914: 565).

The south priest again rises, goes to the kettle, takes a buffalo horn spoon, and dips up a spoonful of corn. He offers the corn in the same order to the outside lodge posts, only instead of going to the outside posts, he goes to the post west of the fireplace, proceeding first to the northeast, northwest, directly west of the fireplace, then to the southwest post, then to the southeast. Then he comes back and stands west of the fireplace. Instead of going outside he makes motions toward the different posts and toward the various positions of the gods and drops the corn at the fireplace.

He goes around the fireplace, on the north side, to place corn on the rim of the fireplace in front of the buffalo skull. Then he puts his hands on the corn, rubs them together, and passes them four times over the skull from the nose up over the horns. Then he moves up, comes to the place between the fireplace and the altar where the pathway is and touches it; he walks up and touches the altar and the sacred objects on it, except for Mother Corn, whom he must not touch because it is Mother Corn herself. He wheels around, goes to the fireplace, and stands there facing east. He goes to the fireplace and touches the pile of corn on its rim, then raises his hands and swings his arms four times, then lowers his arms and motions toward the entrance, saying, “ Rawa .”

He passes the bowl of corn to the people, and they eat. Then the next kettle is brought in and handled in the same way, and so on, until the contents of all are eaten. After they have eaten the corn, it is time to cut up the meat, put it in the kettle, and boil it. When all the meat is put into the kettle, a piece of it and a piece of fat are put in a wooden bowl and given to the head priest, who cuts it into 16 pieces, one for each stick. He then tells the offering man to make the same offering as with the corn. He does so, but does not give any to the buffalo skull; nor does he touch it, but touches the bills of the birds in the bundle, Mother Corn, and the gourds. He makes the same motions as before, swinging his arms out toward the entrance. After that, all say, “ Rawa .”

A big white canvas is spread, the number of people present counted, and the meat placed in piles. If there are only a few participants, each one gets a big pile of meat, which is taken home at the end of the ceremony. The fat is especially prized for putting on the hair.

The head priest of the Evening Star bundle now places the contents in the wrappings somewhat hastily and hangs the bundle up in its new position. Afterwards the woman keeper takes it down and carefully arranges all its contents as they previously were.

Before dismissal of the congregation the head priest makes a speech somewhat as follows:

You chiefs who sit among us, watching over the old men carrying on the ceremonies that were entrusted to you by the gods in the heavens; you two old men who sit near the entrance and speak to us with the wisdom given to you by the gods in the heavens; all you old men in this lodge who sit here with me; old men who have tried to carry on the ceremony as given to us by our forefathers; our friend, Strikes The Enemy, had it in mind to have this ceremony which we have now gone through. He has pleased Tirawahat and the minor gods in the heavens by sending the smoke to their different stations. Some of the gods are so pleased that they will send good gifts to our brother here, and we will also be remembered by them.

Chiefs, old men, and others in this lodge, you came into the lodge of Ckura[unknown][unknown]i[unknown]kawa (Female Seer Comes Through (Summer)) and of Ckura[unknown][unknown]i[unknown]ka[unknown]at (Female Seer Goes Through (Winter)). You sat down in perfect order around the circle so that you were like a wall on each side of the lodge, but the time is near when we must arise. Tirawahat and all the other gods have received our smoke offering, our offering of corn and meat, and also the burnt offering. Draw your robes about your shoulders, sit erect, then rise and walk toward the entrance to Ckura[unknown][unknown]i[unknown]ka[unknown]at and Ckura[unknown][unknown]i[unknown]kawa . So now we rise and walk to Ckura[unknown][unknown]i[unknown]ka[unknown]at ’s entrance [this being the season when she is in charge]. Old men, we have now smoked; we have now eaten. You are dismissed.

They rise and walk toward the entrance of dear Mother Corn, who is really the bundle that is hanging up. They must speak of the lodge entrance as her entrance. That ends the ceremony. They go out.

This concludes the ceremonies in the Evening Star lodge; but before taking up the next step in the ceremonial cycle, the Thunder or Creation Ritual must be given for each of the leading bundles in turn and then for the village bundles—in fact, for every important bundle. The idea seems to be that by this they are awakened and made active for the season. It seems, however, that the priests, at their discretion, may dispense with the song ritual when they come to the ordinary village bundles and merely make the offerings.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual235,Thunger or Bundle Renewal Ceremony,"Spring Ceremonies

The Thunder or Renewal Ceremony

The Skiri bundles deriving their powers from the gods above are associated with the Thunder Ceremony, which relates the creation or the philosophy of the world as conceived by the priests. The Thunder Ritual must be demonstrated for each of the bundles in turn, following the initial ritual for the Evening Star bundle. The priest of this bundle is the highest personage among the Skiri and is the supreme authority over all, for the good reason that he is the one to demonstrate the Thunder Ritual for all bundles. We must, therefore, give our attention to rituals rather than to bundles, for these are but assemblages of paraphernalia associated with the rituals. As will be noted, practically all Skiri bundle rituals are based upon the Thunder Ritual; hence an understanding of it will clear the way for the comprehension of the whole Skiri scheme.

The yearly cycle of Skiri ceremonies is begun by the demonstration of this ritual for all the bundles in succession, beginning with the Evening Star bundle. The Thunder Ritual may be comprehended under six headings: (1) the creation of the world, (2) the smoke offering to Tirawahat, (3) Wonderful Being vitalizes the earth, (4) the people go out over the earth, (5) the pipe smoked, and (6) the feast.

Since the songs are the essential parts of the Thunder Ceremony, it seems best to present them in their logical order (pp. 44-52), independent of the ceremonial program, followed by the order of procedure (pp. 53-62).

The first song of this ritual is designed to recount in order of their occurrence certain important steps in the development of the world. It is in two parts or stanzas, that for women and that for men, as given in the lists below. The belief is that woman was created first and that through her all human things came into the world.

In this ritual, as in others, a song consists of two stanzas. Each stanza is identical except for one word which changes; the substituted word is referred to as a step . In most rituals each song consists of ten steps. However, the first song in the Thunder Ritual and others has 56 steps—26 for women and 30 for men.

The mythological origin of these steps is as follows (Dorsey and Murie, 1907:206-207):

When Paruxti made his preliminary journey upon this earth, at which time he brought his giant Lightning sack of star people, he took first twenty-six steps toward the east, then he rested. Then he continued his journey and rested at the thirtieth step. Thereafter he continued his journey, resting at the end of every ten steps. The first twenty-six steps are for the women and the first thirty for men. Concerning the inequality of the number of steps for the sexes, it is supposed that while woman is leader in many things, her experience is not as wide as that of men. Women are more closely confined to the village, while men roam over the country.
The steps begin in the west with the Evening Star and end in the east with the Morning Star, and are of a progressive nature, always leading to something or even to the creation of life. In the list of steps . . . it will be understood that after the first song is sung, in which all the steps are given, [subsequently] only the first six steps of the men’s and the first four of the women’s are given.

The Songs

The above four lines are repeated, making two verses or eight lines in all. Then the second step, tuha[unknown]ru[unknown] is sung, this word being substituted for the first step, hura[unknown]ru[unknown] and the two verses sung as before. So it continues for each of the steps, in all 208 lines for the woman’s part and 240 for the man’s

Like all Pawnee songs, these are mere abbreviated statements, but stand for definite conceptions. Thus lines A refer to the council of the gods in which they decided to create the earth. Then follows the formation of the earth and reference to vitalizing the earth by the power of Thunder, in line B. In line C we have the term wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown], which has about the same significance as the Dakota wakan, since it implies the qualities of heavenly power.

The second step is conceived to be the creation of plant life, symbolized in the ritual by tuha[unknown]ru[unknown] ‘trees’. After this came the rivers and the lakes [step 3]) caha[unknown]ru[unknown] . With the placing of the seeds [step 4], kaki[unknown][unknown]u[unknown], of all the useful plants, particularly maize, we have what are conceived of as the four main or initial steps in the creation of the world. All this and what follows had been ordered by the gods in council; and when the four gods (Thunder, Lightning, Wind, and Cloud) sitting in the west began to sing these songs, the creation began. The belief is that the Evening Star passed on this information and ritual to the first man upon the earth. The ritual is recited in the spring because it is conceived that just as the singing of the four gods in the west originally helped in the creation of the earth, so the singing of the four priests in the ceremony at springtime will aid the powers to revïvify the earth, plants, water, and seeds and also replenish the powers in the bundle.

The follow steps 5-10: fog, dew, rain, rainstorm, wind, and night, conceived in a cycle. Thus we logically proceed from fog to the more definite forms of precipitation, all of which are considered necessary to the preceding four. In order that the cultivated seeds may reveal the life that is hidden in them, the fog, dew, and rain must do their work, and the wind and night must cool off the ground.

The ten steps just discussed are conceived of as forming a kind of cycle of the fields, but the following sixteen constitute a lodge, or home life, cycle. The room referred to [step. 13] is the small enclosure for the bed found in earthlodges. The altar is the place where the bundle rests. The terms hatu[unknown]ru[unknown] and wahka[unknown]ru[unknown] require some explanation (Figure 4). From the altar toward the fireplace is marked out on the ground a pathway which terminates in a circle. The latter is supposed to represent the wise sayings of the ancestors. It is said that this circle ( wahka[unknown]ru[unknown] ) also symbolized the heart or inner life of man, and the hatu[unknown]ru[unknown], the throat or the mouthpiece for knowledge.

The ritual then proceeds to the fireplace.

The series of steps beginning with [step 21] hiwatu[unknown]ru[unknown] may be taken as parts of the final conception of the lodge cycle, the offering of smoke to Tirawahat (p. 60). Here is recounted the procedure in taking out the pipe to make the offering. First one passes through the entrance of the lodge, and when outside his eye falls upon passing friends to whom he shouts his greetings. Next his eye falls upon the rows of lodges forming the village. Then he returns to the lodge, sees the bowl of his pipe, and recalls the purpose of the offering.

At another time the ceremonial significance of smoking will be discussed, but the offering is not made as these steps are sung. The conception of this ritual is that it is the words of an Indian seer reciting creation events as they happened or as the gods planned that they should happen.

Now we come to the second stanza (man’s steps) of the first song, which recounts the steps in the life of the first man. Again the subject is introduced by a logical series of four steps. We proceed with the essential parts of a man’s costume to the term [step 4] wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown], which here refers to the sacred quality of the Evening Star bundle, in particular the coverings and Mother Corn. Reference to the discussion of the mythical basis for the ceremony will recall the narrative of fitting out the first man with the bundle (Dorsey, 1904a:9; Murie, 1914:553). Then follow in steps 5 to 10 the parts of a warrior’s bundle. In this bundle there is also an ear of corn which, though not the real Mother Corn, is nevertheless carried as her symbol or deputy and given her name, Atira[unknown] (Mother). The skin of the hawk is the insignia of the highest possible rank attained by warriors, and in the bundle is a miniature war club to symbolize the hawk’s wing, for he sometimes strikes down his prey by a stroke of his wing. The karu[unknown]su[unknown] [step 7] is the covering of the warrior’s bundle, but stands for the entire package. Kuhkawi[unknown]u[unknown] and ka[unknown]uktu[unknown] are the feathers for a warrior’s head, where they stand for definite deeds.

The bluebird kiriki is conceived of as the carrier of prayers to the sky. The bird is placed in a buckskin cover and tied to the mouthpiece of the pipe that belongs to the bundle, but on the warpath the warrior wears it on his head that it may constantly carry his prayers aloft.

The 11th step, ra[unknown]tara[unknown]wi[unknown]su[unknown], refers to all paints, or paints in general; it is then followed by the four important colors [steps 12-15, black, red, yellow, and white], which stand for the four world quarters, seasons, etc. When a warrior is approaching his village on the return from a successful raid, he fires the grass as a smoke signal and then rubs some of the soot ( ca[unknown]uktu[unknown] ) over his face. He may also paint streaks of red and yellow for the lightning and paint his robe white. The relation of these four colors to the bundle and ceremonies is discussed in the Four Pole Ceremony (p. 109).

It is conceived that there are four great powers in the heavens [steps 16-17, 19-20]: the bear, mountain lion, wildcat, and wolf. The first two are represented by constellations, but the cat skin, because of its spots, was, in its extended form, taken as representing all the stars. The wolf is a definite star (Sirius). In order to succeed a warrior must have the great qualities of these four animals: the great strength and ferocity of the bear, the magnetic or drawing power of the mountain lion, the cunning of the cat, and the crafty, thieving traits of the wolf. The specific reason for having these animals in the ritual is that the warrior may derive powers from them.

The weapons of the warrior are next in order, and the arrow is symbolically followed through its logical construction [steps 21-24]. It may be noted that no feathers are found on the arrow; the story is that the feathers on the pipestem were originally put there to make the prayers go straight to the heavens and that later they were placed upon arrows for the same purpose. In any case, there is a belief that arrows were used a long time before they were feathered.

As in the case of the woman, the pipe steps end the series, but the man’s pipe steps include two additional important particulars, hu[unknown]ruksu[unknown] (step 28) and takusu[unknown] (step 29). The first refers to regular decorations placed upon the stem, among which are the arrow feathers just mentioned; the second refers to offerings hung upon the pipestem at certain times, e.g., scalps.

The final step (30) of this series refers not only to pipes but to all ceremonial sticks and woods. In certain bundle rituals there is a stick for each song, all of which are sometimes offered to the gods. Again, an altar is constructed, around which are set up many red-painted sticks bearing small bags of tobacco, which stand for the stars or the gods in the heavens. All such sacred sticks of whatever kind are referred to by the term ratta[unknown]ru[unknown] .

This seems the appropriate place to discuss the general interpretation of these song steps. The priests believe that germination is the fundamental principle of creation. The idea that woman existed first, or was created first, is consistent with this concept. The real hidden meaning of the four initial steps for men is said to be conception and birth. Thus the term asu[unknown]ru[unknown] means a pocket-like covering into which something is thrust, the womb; kstaripi[unknown]ru[unknown] is here the umbilical cord, while rawitat is the enveloping membrane of a fetus, the chorion. Wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown] implies that all this is of the holiest character possible or that here is the coming of the first man, Wonderful Being.

The same interpretation is put upon the bundles containing the ear of corn, for the seeds are the germs of life, all carefully wrapped up in a kind of womb ready for the processes of life to begin.

Turning again to the song steps, the concept of atira[unknown] (Mother) is clear, but kutawikucu[unknown] (hawk) symbolizing the Morning Star who was the father of the first man, is less obvious. Then follow all the things he was to receive as equipment for his journey over the earth. The karu[unknown]su[unknown] was the wonderful bag he carried, from which came the people.

These interpretations of this ritual were not public, but the private teachings of the priests. For this reason their fundamental part in the development of this philosophy is given a strong probability.

Second Song

In lines A the conception is that storm clouds rush out of the entrance to the lodge of the gods, where the heavenly priests sit singing, as in the Evening Star Ritual. This symbolizes the coming of rain clouds that have a rounded appearance, not unlike the skyline of an earthlodge village. The incident recorded is the emergence of the Wonderful Being from the home of the gods to put life into the earth, thus again symbolizing the creation.

The preceding nine lines are sung for each of the first four steps in the woman’s list: hura[unknown]ru[unknown], tuha[unknown][unknown], caha[unknown]ru[unknown], and kaki[unknown][unknown]u[unknown], making 36 lines or 4 stanzas in all. If no more are to be sung, the priest announces the abbreviation by, “We will now shorten our pathways. We shall sing but ten steps, four for women and six for men.”

For the man’s steps we have again the same nine lines for each stanza and sung for six steps [1-6]— asu[unknown]ru[unknown], kstaripi[unknown]ru[unknown], rawitat, wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown], atira[unknown], and kiriki —making 54 lines or 6 stanzas in all. Following this is a period of rest, during which the priests smoke the bundle pipe.

Third Song

The first stanza is sung for the first four steps in the woman’s list and the second stanza for the first six of the man’s list, just as in the preceding songs.

In the first stanza, lines C and D are addressed to the people in general, but in the second stanza they are addressed to the man himself. Lines D and E of the second stanza are perhaps better rendered by, “The wonderful power wrapped up in the bundle that you now have is the place where good fortune resides.”

Fourth Song

As before, the first stanza is sung for the first four woman’s steps and the second stanza for the first six man’s steps. In this case, moccasins signify a covering, as the covering for the bundle (see p. 46). When the thunders sound, the power of the lightning enters the bundle anew.

Fifth Song

The first stanza is sung for the first four woman’s steps and the second stanza for the first six man’s steps. The second stanza is precisely the same, except that asu[unknown]ru[unknown] is used for hura[unknown]ru[unknown] . The idea here is that the entering of the renewing power of life into the earth and the objects upon it is now complete and that everything stands here filled with the wonderful power. The songs are sung in a gradually falling pitch which is said to be an imitation of the thunder.

These preceding five songs constitute the main elements of the Thunder Ritual. If the full ritual is given, each of the songs must be sung for the whole list of steps, but it is usual to sing only the minimum number (4 and 6) as we have indicated. In its complete form the ritual would contain 2800 lines, whereas the abbreviated form we have used contains but 738. It may be noted that the number of lines to a song varies, as 8, 9, 8, 7, 4, but this may have been accidental, since we have no information as to their significance.

The general theme of these five songs, as taught by the priests, is the logical steps of creation: (1) in the heavens the gods spoke, saying that the earth and all things were to receive the wonderful power of life; (2) this power is sent to the earth and to all things; (3) then the gods spoke again, that the earth and all things should be made ready for the people and that to them should be given all the things recounted in the ritual; (4) all these things are placed on earth ready for the people; (5) the wonderful power of life then passes into the earth and all things.

The opening of the bundle and the reciting of this ritual are thus clearly symbolic of the creation, and the repetition of it each spring is symbolic of the renewal of the earth, which is in turn considered symbolic of the creation and is redemonstrated by the gods for the benefit of mankind. This conception was taught by the priests and is entirely consistent with the literal meaning of the ritual. It must, therefore, have been conceived by the composer and not subsequently read into it. In our discussion of societies we have shown how fundamental was the idea of the spring renewal.

Smoke Offering Song

In the third stanza, wakucu[unknown] is substituted for ackat of the second stanza. Wakucu[unknown] is not easy to translate, but here stands for the thunders. In the fourth stanza takucu[unknown] ‘lightning’ is substituted; in the fifth stanza, rukucu[unknown] ‘clouds’; in the sixth stanza, cikucu[unknown] ‘winds’.

The last four terms in this song are also said to refer to the four great animal powers (p. 45) because the people felt that as these gods are so holy they should be thought of as the most powerful beings. Again they are conceived of as Tirawahat, Morning Star, Big Black Meteoric Star, and Wolf Star, for the same reason.

Each stanza is sung four times. In these stanzas the singing is supposed to imitate the thunder, especially where the pitch descends to the lowest possible point.

The conception now is that the people are thankful for all that has been done for them and make an offering to Tirawahat.

The smoke offering is made outside, where on a specially kindled fire, buffalo heart, tongue, and native tobacco were placed. At the same time a scalp is offered along with the heart and tongue. As this fire begins to burn, the smoke hangs heavy or wavers, hence the first stanza. Presently it rises in a slender column toward the sky or to Tirawahat, hence the second stanza (literally, some eating, i.e., smoking). Then, as the fire burns down, the other songs are sung in order. Offerings of parts of the scalp and meat are placed upon sticks and set up in the ground.

In the ordinary smoke offering no meat or scalp is burned and no sticks bearing offerings are set up. At such times only the first two stanzas are sung.

Song to Wonderful Being

The next ritual of the Thunder or Creation Ceremony is a song consisting of many stanzas, which recount the visit of Wonderful Being to the earth. (It should be noted that Wonderful Being is, after all, but a manifestation of Tirawahat himself.)

It is narrated as a myth (Dorsey, 1904a:14), but its full meaning is not clearly stated in that connection. The coming and passing of a thunderstorm is taken as the type and into it is read the story of the gods. A diagram is sometimes made as in Figure 5. Here we see the lodge in the western sky where the four gods live (A). From the entrance issues Wonderful Being; he pauses at B and shouts (thunder); then he opens his eyes to look about (lightning) and then throws back his robe (the rolling clouds). He sends the lightning out in all directions, the full circuit of the heavens. Then he passes to the earth, going over it from west to east through the village (C). As he comes to the village, he enters the lodge of the Evening Star bundle and at the altar receives the pipe offering. He then passes out and on to the east to the furthermost limit of the world, whence he returns to the sky. In the same way as Wonderful Being made the initial journey to the world, the power of life is sent forth anew by the thunders every spring. It is through the clouds that the thunder speaks to, and the lightning vitalizes, the earth.

A free rendering in outline of this song would be somewhat as follows: Tirawahat enters into all things, or is ever present in the storm. But after the material universe was made, he sat in his lodge in the heavens thinking, and his thoughts turned outward to the lifeless world below. There came to him the idea of giving it life, or the real creation. Then he arose, lifted a foot, and walked about the lodge, thus giving it a spiritual existence. Then he passed out at the door and stood, and as he stretched out his arms extending his robe, he appeared wrapped in the dark heavy cloud of the western sky. Then he looked about from side to side, whence the lightning was seen. Next he took a deep breath and the thunder rolled and rumbled along over the earth. The vitalizing power of the god thus permeated all things and gave them life. The idea is that there are three stages in the progress of the thunder: first it reaches the earth, then spreads about over the earth, and finally completes the circuit. In all the stanzas these acts are successively sung too. The same idea applies thence to each topic in this song to the Wonderful Being. Throughout the following song, the priests reenact the sequence of events of creation by Wonderful Being and the powers in the heavens; i.e., “the powers in the heavens are sung down to the lodge and back again to their seats above.”

First Stanza

In the first stanza the god sits in the heavens wrapped in the powers as if with clouds, and his sitting there so clothed is an indication that he is planning the creation.

Each stanza is the same as the first, except for the substitution in lines A of a new phrase, which describes each stage of Tirawahat’s journey to the earth. The number of stanzas to be sung is determined by the priest, who may omit any stanza except the last. Throughout the singing, the priest holds a filled pipe for Wonderful Being when he enters. The pipe is not lighted, but is kept for the next ritual.

Song for the People

The following ritual deals with human beings upon the earth, but it also duplicates the form of the song to the Wonderful Being. The song for the people recounts the going out of men to scout for buffalo and how they go out over the hills and streams, just as did Wonderful Being when he went out to look over the earth for the first time. This song recounts these events; i.e., “follows them out and back into the lodge.” Then the crier goes through the village and all the people rejoice. At the point where the scouts are to return to the lodge, the leading priest pauses in the singing and narrates the imagined experience of the scouts. The whole is an imaginary scene, not acted out but outlined in word and song.

At the beginning of this song the priest says, “Now we shall sing again, and this time we shall sing about ourselves, or the people.” The idea is that owing to the fact that Wonderful Being first went over the earth and looked at all things, the power to do that thing was thereby infused into the earth and all things, for which reason people themselves are now able to go out and look for buffalo.

The text of this song is the same as the song to the Wonderful Being (p. 49), with the following substitutions for lines A in the subsequent 35 stanzas: [...]. The the pipe disappeared.

It should be noted that even the reference to smoking in the latter stanzas is imaginary, because though a filled pipe is present, it is still unlighted. When the priest has sung all the stanzas he wishes, however, he passes the pipe to the tally-stick man, who lights it, smokes, and passes it about as the priest directs. When really burned out, the ashes are dumped out at the fireplace, the ritual is closed (Murie, 1914:564), and a feast is held (for description, see Murie, 1914: 565).",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual236,The Corn Planting Ceremony,"The Corn Planting Ceremony

The Corn Planting Ceremony of the Skull bundle was held when the willow leaves were out, but the preliminary sign was taken from the stars. The priests noted the position of the seven stars (Pleiades). At a certain hour of the night or dawn—the exact procedure is not known—a priest sat by the fireplace and looked up through the smoke hole. If he could see the seven stars directly above, it was time for the Planting Ceremony. The Planting Ceremony is connected with a very important bundle, known as the Skull bundle (Figure 16). The Pawnee name is cahikspa[unknown]ruksti[unknown] ‘wonderful, or holy, person’. This name refers to the skull, here conceived as a symbol of First Man. The bundle is kept in Center Village, also the home of the Evening Star bundle.  

Its primary function seems to lie in presiding over the Skiri federation of villages as exemplified in the Four Pole Ceremony (see p. 107 for description of the bundle).

During the winter buffalo hunt a woman may have a vision or dream that she is to be the one to give the Corn Planting Ritual before going into the fields. She tells her brothers about it and one of them is delegated to kill a buffalo for her so that she can prepare the meat for the ceremony. On killing a buffalo, he takes the meat to his sister’s tipi, where she places the meat upon the ground. After unloading the meat, she returns to her brother. Though the woman is married, the meat must be gotten from her side of the family and not from her husband’s family.  

She takes some of the buffalo meat, cuts it up, puts it into a kettle, and cooks it. She then sends for four men who are keepers and owners of the planting ritual [i.e., the Skull bundle]. When these men are seated in the lodge, she tells them that her brother has killed a buffalo for her so she can sponsor the dance for planting corn. These men thank her. She, of course, tells her dream and then feeds meat to the men.

These four men are not the village priests of Center Village; they are the owners of the Skull bundle’s planting ritual. The leading priests of the village have nothing to do with this ceremony, but the Evening Star bundle priest must be present. The ritual is in some parts secret and known only to these men.  

All winter and spring these men know that this woman has pledged to sponsor the ceremony. After the ceremonial shelling of the corn, they begin their preparations. They go along the creeks and look at the willows; when the leaves appear they know it is time to plant the seeds. They also watch the moon, for the planting should be done during a new moon.

When the signs indicate that the time has arrived, a woman is instructed to clear the lodge. The woman keeper of the Skull bundle takes the bundle from the wall, carries it outside, sets up the tripod, and hangs it up. The lodge is then cleared of all bedding and furniture and swept out with bundles of hyssops. In the meantime the four men have gone to their homes. Each sends out several boys for willow sprouts. These are taken to the lodge of the Skull bundle and placed upon the ground in the entrance, some on the north side and some on the south side. The women then take the willows and place them around inside the lodge on the ground, the leaves toward the fireplace. Mats are spread on top of the layer of willows and in front of the altar. Then all the women leave the lodge and the four men return.

The men send for the Evening Star bundle priest, who is to sit with them at the altar. They also send for the woman who had the vision to prepare the parfleche of meat. She takes her seat at the north side of the altar. They ask her if everything is arranged. She says, “Yes.” Then the old men send for four other women, daughters either of chiefs, warriors, or doctors.

These women are given seats on the south side. The priest of the Skull bundle then announces that he is about to conduct a ceremony, that the women may be allowed to go into the fields to plant their corn, that they are wanted as leaders of the dance. If they accept, each will furnish a parfleche of meat and a pot of corn. Then these women are excused. The priest now instructs the woman who had the vision in the secrets of the ceremony. He anoints her with red paint and explains its significance.

In the evening the Skull bundle is brought inside and placed upon the altar. They untie it, taking out the sacred objects, and place the skull on the ground in front of the altar; which they have swept; the bow and arrows from the bundle are placed on the ground also. At the same time, the two fawnskins are placed on the south side of the bundle and the two swan necks on the north side. One of the errand men is sent out to the doctors to get five rattles, which he places on the north side of the bundle.  

Now the descendants of the Skull bundle owners are sent for and seated on the north side. Other men are given seats about the lodge. Then the four women are called; two are assigned places on the north side and two on the south side. Other women now come in and sit behind them. The priests take up the rattles and begin to sing; but this night ceremony is only a rehearsal for the following day. As they sing, the women rise and practice dancing. At the end of the singing, all but the bundle keepers and their descendants go to their homes. The Evening Star bundle priest may leave or stay, but the woman who gives the ceremony remains. They have meat and corn, brought in by outside people, and sit up all night telling stories about their customs in olden times, how they came to keep the Skull bundle, and who are still direct descendants of the first bundle keepers. A little after midnight, the woman’s brother comes for her and takes her home. Then the men lie down around the altar. The leading priest, however, does not go to sleep, but watches for the dawn.

At the approach of dawn, the priest wakes the other priests and the two errand men. He sends the two errand men out to notify the absent members of the Skull bundle family to come into the lodge. The priest then tells them it is time to begin the ceremony. He selects four men to go to the creek to get willow sprouts. They place them in front of the altar in two piles, one on the north side and one on the south. The priest sends the two errand men to the lodge of the woman who had the vision to bring the parfleche of meat she has prepared. They place the parfleche on the south side of the fireplace. The two errand men untie the bundle and press the parfleche down so that the meat may be exposed. Then they are sent for four ropes of buffalo hair. The priest tells two men at the altar to go to the parfleche to get a strip of meat and fat from under the buffalo’s shoulder. The head priest then rises, takes a bunch of willow sprouts (which have leaves on them), the strip of meat and the fat, and ties the willows and the meat together with a buffalo-hair rope. He tells the others to rise. They march around the fireplace to the northeast post. Here they pile up parfleches of meat for him to stand on. The others steady him and watch. He ties the bunch of willows to the northeast post. In a similar manner he ties a bunch to the northwest, to the southwest, and to the southeast posts. The posts are then painted with black, yellow, white, and red bands below the meat. This ceremony is something like the Four Pole Ceremony, but only the members of the Skull bundle people are allowed to be present.

All this time the skull is in front of the altar. When they finish decorating the posts, the errand man takes some coals and places them near the southwest post. The Evening Star priest places on the fire a roll of fat mixed with sweetgrass, then stands west of the fire. The errand man takes up the skull, raises it to the sky, gradually lowers it in the smoke, passing it through four times, takes the skull in his left hand, holds his right hand in the smoke, and then passes it over the skull. Next he takes the skull in his right hand, passing his hand through the smoke as before, and then gives the skull to the errand man, who returns it to the altar. All the sacred objects in the bundle are now passed through the smoke so that they may be purified. Then the priests go through the smoke. The south errand man is the last to go through it, after which he takes up the coals, returns them to the fireplace, and stamps upon the place where the coals were, removing all traces of the fire.

The Evening Star priest then tells the people to go to their homes to dress up and to get their breakfasts. The priests remain and have the errand man serve them with meat and corn. When they are through, they send for the woman providing the meat. She comes with her brother and is given a seat west of the altar. Her brother, who must be well dressed, is given a seat at the west of the lodge. They give him red paint for his face, hands, and head, and tell him to go through the village to visit all lodges where his and his sister’s relatives live. He tells them that Wonderful Being (Paruksti) needs some wood and his sister needs assistance; also that they must cook something. He really means for them to bring gifts to the lodge.

The errand men are sent to the four lodges of the leading bundles to tell the people that Wonderful Being needs hoes. At their request, the woman keeper of each bundle rises and unties a buffalo shoulder blade hoe. The errand men get these hoes, take them to the lodge, and place them at the altar, two on the south side and two on the north side. (With each of the four leading bundles is a hoe made of a buffalo scapula.)

The woman who pledged the ceremony now paints herself. The people have brought in meat and kettles of corn, which are placed on the south side of the lodge. The priest directs the brother of the woman and a young man to go through the village and call the people to the lodge. They tell the people to prepare, to dress up, and to paint. The brother of the woman who had the vision takes the lead, and they march through the village from lodge to lodge, inviting the people. In the meantime some have brought, as presents to the skull, buffalo robes and other things, which are taken in and placed between the altar and the fireplace.

The leading priest now takes up the skull and paints it red. He takes some blue paint and makes a blue streak around the forehead and down the nose. Next he takes a black silk handkerchief and ties it around the head, the knot on the forehead. Then he takes a roll of soft down feathers mixed with red paint and puts it inside the black handkerchief. Finally he sticks in a soft feather as a plume. The style of decoration is similar to the symbol of Tirawahat noted by Fletcher (1904, fig. 197).

So decorated, the skull is the likeness of Tirawahat himself. Other than a priest, only the select may decorate the skull. The priest may choose a young man who has never been on the warpath, who is kind, good, and pure, has winning ways and no enemies. He alone can approach the skull to make these marks upon it. A man who has killed an enemy or has taken a scalp must not come near it, because his hands have touched human blood. A man who is a warrior may be selected to cut up the meat to put in the kettle, but the skull is too sacred for a man with bloody hands.  

The skull is set on the ground in front of the altar where everything is arranged. The people are still outside. The officiating priest fills a pipe with native tobacco and gives it to the women’s brother, who offers the smoke to the gods in the heavens and to the skull. Then the people come in.

While all this has been going on, the people in every lodge were painting, dressing, and preparing for the ceremony. Every man taking part in the ceremony must bring a present of some kind; even the women and children must bring presents. The woman who had the vision is already there. The four women assistants come in. One is seated close to her, one at the northeast, one at the northwest near the keeper of the ceremony, one at the southeast, and one at the southwest. All the women come in and are seated around the circle of the lodge. On the northwest side a few men of the Skull bundle are seated among the people.

Everybody is ready now. The woman’s brother acts for the people of the north side and another man is selected for the south side. The north man rises and gives hoes to the two women on the north side; the other man rises and gives hoes to the two on the south. The south man takes the two fawn-skins and gives them to the two women on the south side. The man on the north side takes up the fawn-skins and gives them to two women on the north side. Then the people come in and give to the skull presents, which they pile up between it and the fireplace.

Now they are all ready. The Skull priest rises, takes a basket which either his wife or sisters made under his direction (and which has no decorations on it and is like a dice basket), goes around the fireplace, and gives it to the woman giving the ceremony. As the priest takes his seat, he hands gourd rattles to the other priests, reserving one for himself. Then he begins to sing. At the first song, the women stand ready to scrape the earth with their hoes, their right feet forward and hands outstretched. They sing the first four woman’s steps (p. 43) and pause. Then they sing and dance, making motions with the hoes. The woman giving the ceremony dances with the basket. Even those who have no hoes dance with the same motions. When the women with the hoes are tired, they turn the hoes over to other women, all making the same motions. The spectators crowd around the entrance. They sing six of the man’s steps (p. 43) and at the last step the two women on the south side dance forward and up to the woman with the basket, and they lay the fawnskin in it. Then the two on the north side dance up with the fawnskins. The giver of the ceremony sits down and places the basket near the altar. The singing continues until they sing about the planting. When finished, they go through another pipe ritual.

After the first two songs are sung they pause, and the girls and young women who have borrowed pipes and pouches from their grandfathers return the pipes to their grandfathers. When a man receives the pipe, he has to give something either to the girl or the people at the altar, place something at the altar or present some food. Then he will tell some of his brave deeds: how many times he has counted coup, taken scalps, etc. He narrates all of his successes and jests at the girl about her being “successful” in life. These jests are the important features, affording great merriment. They are decidedly obscene, the idea back of them being that she may quickly become a mother. Then he returns the pipe. Some men do not like to receive the pipe and the obligations it incurs, since they cannot afford to give the presents. When the songs about placing the seeds into the ground have been sung, they are through, and the women gather up the things and go out.

In the dancing, a few men use bows and arrows. When the women step out with their right feet and right hands extended, the men step out with bows and arrows, aiming at something as if to shoot. During the dance these men move back and forth among the dancers; and wherever they see a woman nearly exhausted, they go up to her and rub up against her as would a buffalo bull.

When the dance is over, the officiating priest asks if everything is all right. They look at the ground where they have been dancing and see rolls of shedded buffalo hair scattered over the ground, and they know everything is all right; they are not only going to be successful in buffalo hunts, but there is going to be plenty of corn. This success is assured because there are rolls of buffalo hair scattered over the lodge. They are thankful. Now they are excused. Everyone who has no right in the ceremony—all the visitors and all the women, except the one giving the ceremony—leaves the lodge. When they are through, the shoulder blade hoes are laid upon the altar again. Then the priests divide up the presents, including the meat and the corn.

Everybody except the four priests goes home at night. Early in the morning the priests take down the willows on the posts and ask the brother of the woman to come into the lodge. These willows are taken west of the lodge to the creek and set in a nice place where the water is smooth and not swift. They are placed in the same position as in the lodge, under the water out of sight. Nobody else knows anything about this. Then they go back to the lodge, take the handkerchief and down feather from the skull, and place them in the bundle with the swan- and fawnskins. They place the skull on top of the bundle, but leave the markings on it for time to erase.

When they return the hoes to the different leading bundles, they send some of the meat along with them as payment for their use.

The woman who had the vision goes home. They tell her not to wash off the paint but to let it wear off. It is night when the ceremony is over, but before daylight of the next day, the women are out at work, beginning to clear the fields.

For each of the following eleven songs, the first stanza is sung four times to the first four woman’s steps: hura[unknown]ru[unknown] ‘earth’, tuha[unknown]ru[unknown] ‘trees and shrubbery’, caha[unknown]ru[unknown] ‘waters’, and kaki[unknown][unknown]u[unknown] ‘seeds’. The second stanza is sung six times to the following man’s steps: asu[unknown]ru[unknown] ‘moccasins’, kstaripi[unknown]ru[unknown] ‘moccasin string’, rawitat ‘robe’, wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown] ‘wonderful’, atira[unknown] ‘Mother (Corn)’, and kiriki ‘bluebird’.

[...]

In dancing, the leading woman carries the basket and moves about in a waving or twinkling manner (p. 79); the idea seems to be that she is causing the basket to reach out to the people.",1,0,0,1,1,0
Ritual237,Young Corn Plant Ritual,"Young Corn Plant Ritual

The seed from the sacred ears of corn kept in the bundles was planted in particular mounds. The growth of this corn was carefully watched; and when the stalks reached a height of about two inches [5 cm] and there were two well-developed blades, the priests considered it time to hold a special ceremony. In some respects, this is the most important unit of the annual ceremonial cycle.

When the time has arrived, the priest of the leading bundle then in charge calls in the other four priests. The bundle is taken down and the lodge prepared for a ceremony. The errand men are sent out to notify the people, who are given seats in the lodge according to their stations. Then the priest mixes some buffalo fat with red paint and rolls it into two balls, one of which he passes down the north side and the other down the south side of the assembly. The men paint themselves with the balls as they pass, and when they reach the errand men they are returned to the priest. Some time during the year, a man who has led a good life and performed many worthy deeds may make a pledge that he will furnish the meat for this ceremony. During the winter hunt he so notifies the proper priest. The special function of this man is to conduct the priests safely to the mounds of sacred corn.

The priest now sends for this man; and when he arrives, the priest hands him a buffalo-hair rope, which the man ties around his waist. The priest then paints him red and hands him the sacred pipe filled with native tobacco. The four assisting priests also tie buffalo-hair ropes around their waists. The head priest then directs the man with the pipe to kneel before him and as he does so, secretly puts something into his hand, whispering directions to him about what to do when he reaches the field. The pipe bearer and the four priests are then directed to stand on the north side of the fireplace in their proper order. The south errand man is directed to take a firebrand from the fire. The head priest, who is still seated at the altar, takes up his rattle and begins to sing the first song, which concerns going for the plant. As he sings, the procession moves out of the lodge toward the field. The four priests, marching, take up the song as they fall in behind the man with the pipe, and the errand man with the firebrand brings up the rear. On the journey they sing all 26 of the woman’s steps and then all 30 of the man’s steps, as if it were a long journey. When they get to the field planted by the keeper of the leading bundle, they pause; if there are still some of the steps to be sung, they must complete them.

As they stand in the field; the pipe bearer makes a circuit of the area and goes to the sacred hill to see if the corn plant is sufficiently grown. If he finds it unsatisfactory he proceeds to other mounds until he finds one of the sacred plants that is adequately developed. When he has found one, he returns and leads the procession to the mound. They stand facing east with the mound in front of them. The pipe bearer takes his place at the head of the line and they sing, “Mother stands here; Mother on the earth stands here.” They sing this song to the usual ten steps (4 woman’s, 6 man’s; see pp. 43, 46); then they sit down upon the ground.

The pipe man arises to make the regular smoke offering and passes around the south side of the hill, stopping at the east (Figure 10). Then the errand man rises with his firebrand and goes around in the same way. When he reaches the pipe bearer, he lights the pipe for him. The pipe man rises, faces east, gives one whiff of smoke to the northeast (No. 1), then faces southeast (No. 2) and gives a whiff of smoke there. He comes to the hill and gives one whiff of smoke from the southeast toward the northeast (No. 3), one from the northeast toward the northwest (No. 4), walks around to the northwest and gives another whiff toward the southwest (No. 5), proceeds to a point directly west of the hill where another whiff is given to the southeast (No. 6); then goes around and gives one whiff at the southeast for Mother Earth (No. 7). Again he goes around the hill by way of the north side and stands on the west side, facing east. Here he gives one whiff to Tirawahat (No. 8) in the heavens and one towards the east to the Morning Star (No. 9); he turns to the west and gives one to the Evening Star (No. 10), then faces east again and gives one to the Big Black Meteoric Star (No. 11). He gives three puffs of smoke to the north to Breath (No. 12), to Wind of Fortune (No. 13), and to Pahukatawa (No. 14). Finally he gives one whiff toward the southeast for the sun (No. 15) and one toward the southwest for the moon (No. 16). 38   He then empties the ashes at the base of the cornhill, takes the pipe in his left hand, passes his hands back and forth along the stem, and clasping it to his breast, prays. Then he turns around and hands the pipe to the ranking priest.

The pipe bearer now proceeds to do as he was instructed by the head priest before he left the lodge (p. 84). Four pieces of buffalo fat, taken from the heart and tongue of a consecrated buffalo, two pieces from each organ, were given him by the head priest. Each piece of buffalo fat had native tobacco inside of it. As stated before, this procedure was known only to the priest and himself. The pipe bearer goes to his former station northeast of the hill, sits down there, and with his fingers digs a small hole in the side of the hill. In it he places a piece of the tongue fat. Before placing it, he scrapes the tobacco from the inside and spreads the fat over it. When properly arranged, he covers it with earth. Now he moves to the northwest of the hill where he deposits a piece of the heart fat, then a piece of tongue fat to the southwest of the hill, and lastly a piece of heart fat to the southeast of the hill. Then he directs the four priests to sit facing the points where he buried the fat, while he himself stands west of the hill. He points out to them the plant he has selected, which they are to dig out with their fingers. In this they must exercise great care so as not to disturb the other stalks in the sacred hill, nor to mutilate in any way the one they are to take. The roots must not be broken, but removed entire. Thus, gradually and carefully, they work it out. The plants is the covering or wrapping spoken of in the songs ( rawitat ), the roots are the strings ( kstaripi[unknown]ru[unknown] ), and the seed hanging there is the moccasin ( asu[unknown]ru[unknown] ), or covering, for the power.

The leader takes the plant in his hand and stands facing east; the man carrying the pipe tucks it vertically under his buffalo robe, as a woman packs a child on her back. They have some buffalo wool in which the plant is wrapped. They form a line as before and return to the lodge, singing the following song to the usual ten steps.

If they have not reached the lodge by the time that all 10 stanzas (4 woman’s steps, 6 man’s steps) have been sung, they sing the fourth song (“Mother now journeys upon the earth”) for as many stanzas as may be necessary.

All this time the priest in the lodge has been conducting the singing. The villagers keep a sharp lookout for the priests with the corn plant, and as the procession approaches word is carried to the lodge. The priest in the lodge holds out his left hand and sings the following:

The procession enters, circles the fire four times, or until the steps are all sung, and the plant is placed in the priest’s hand. He removes the wrapping of buffalo wool, takes out the plant, and places it in front of the altar on the sacred circular place upon the bare earth. Then he fills his own pipe and smokes to the plant.

While the men were out after the corn plant, the leading priest sent the other errand men to the woods to get three or four straight dogwood sticks. These were now lying upon the altar. The leading priest announces, “We are to put new life into Mother Corn. We must first proceed to make the stick on which Mother shall be tied.” The leading priest directs the two priests on his right to select one of the sticks for this purpose. They then select one and lay it upon the altar.

The errand man is directed to place a mat and cushion on the south side of the lodge. Then the priest announces that a man must be selected to make Mother and that he picks out such and such a man because he is a great warrior, a man of good character, and above all a good arrow-maker. As he makes this announcement, he fills his own small pipe and directs the errand man to present it to the arrow-maker. The errand man passes down and pauses before his seat, holding out the pipe. The arrow-maker sits for a time as if rapt in thought and then reaches for the pipe. At this the whole assemblage cries out, “ Rawa .”

One of the assistant priests then takes up a coal of fire and lights the pipe, and all sit in perfect silence as he smokes. When the pipe has been emptied the assistant priest returns it to the leading priest and goes to the arrow-maker, takes him by the left arm and, circling the fire once, seats him upon the mat. Then the priest calls upon the errand man, who places before him the dogwood stick, a new knife, and an elkhorn arrow-straightener, a stone smoother, some sinew, and different paints. Then they sing the song about the different colored straighteners. They speak as if there were four of these—one black, one red, one yellow, and one white—but there is only one implement present.

At the end of these songs the errand man picks up the objects before him and takes them to the arrow-maker. The priest addresses the arrow-maker, directing him to take up the stick, put it in the hole of the straightener, and pass it completely through four times, and then lay it down. After that the arrow-maker is directed to take up the stick and straighten it as they sing to the usual ten (4 woman’s, 6 man’s) steps of the two stanzas.

When this task is completed, the arrow-maker takes up the straightener again and, holding the piece of horn at a sharp angle, he rasps the stick against the edges of the hole, scraping the surface smooth. This makes a squeaking noise. To this they sing:

Next the arrow-maker takes up the smoothing stones and rubs the shaft as they sing additional songs. At the conclusion the arrow-maker says, “Priest, I have finished.” Then the priest directs him to hold the stick up before him as they sing:

Then the arrow-maker blesses himself with the stick, as is done with the pipe in the smoke offering. The errand man approaches, taking the stick and repeating the procedure. It then passes to the priest, who fondles it as if it were an infant, while they sing:

At the close of these procedures, the arrow-maker is directed to mark the stick. So he cuts a small notch about one inch [2.5 cm] from the top. With the tool used to make arrow grooves, he makes a straight line down through the middle of the stick. Then the stick is laid upon the altar. The transverse notch stands for the circular place in the floor of the lodge (p. 44) and the long groove is the throat, or road. Yet, the form is spoken of as the face or mouth, the reason for which will appear from the songs.  

A mat is placed on the south side of the lodge and upon it a cushion. The priest announces, “We have come to a part of the ritual which is very difficult, for we now have to call upon a woman to help us out.”   The pipe bearer who brought the plant is instructed to go through the village and call upon all the young women who are nursing children. The priest says, “I know that most of our women are afraid to do what is required, but we are here doing something which the gods in the heavens command us to do, and we will trust in them to protect the woman who assists us and to watch over her children.” He instructs the pipe bearer to invite every woman he meets and to persist until someone consents.

It seems that in olden times one woman who performed this service lost the child she had at the time and subsequently every child she had, died. For that reason the women were afraid; but there were times when women who consented raised their children, and after that had other children who grew up to be successful men and women.

So the man goes through the village wearing his buffalo robe with the hair inside and the buffalo-hair rope around his waist. As he goes along, he sees women outside playing games. They know what he wants. According to the custom, when the women were outside the lodge they could not be asked. So he goes from one lodge to another until he finds a young woman who has a young child. If she says, “No, I cannot do that,” he continues until one consents.

The woman enters the ceremonial lodge and gives her child to someone else. She is seated on the cushion, facing west. The priests and old men are thankful to have her come. They talk to her and pray that she and her child will live long. They place before her a wooden bowl of corn. Four times she dips and eats a little corn with a buffalo horn spoon, then returns the spoon to the bowl. The head priest then says, “We want you to give us some of your milk. You are now to expose your breasts to the gods in the heavens.” They tell her to take off her clothing to her waist. The priests take up their rattles and sing the first stanza of the eleventh song. The woman is told to lean back so that she will expose her breast to the sky. They begin to sing the song about her taking hold of the breast (2nd stanza). When they get to the part of the song that refers to pressing milk from it, a man with a shell sits before her and presses into the shell two drops of milk from the right breast and two from the left. He repeats this with another shell (3rd to 5th stanzas). He places the milk at the altar and she puts on her clothes. Then they pass her the wooden bowl with the corn; she may eat as much as she likes, taking the remainder home. As she rises with the bowl, the errand man is instructed to follow her with an armful of dried meat. When they reach the woman’s home, he hands the meat to her mother or grandmother and returns with the empty bowl.

As the woman leaves the lodge, the shells containing mother’s milk are set before the arrow-maker while the priests sing songs about the buried paints and take up the rattles.

Near the altar are a small wooden bowl and a clam shell. In this shell some white clay is mixed with water; with it they paint the stick, making it perfectly white. Then they wash out the shell and mix some red paint in it, and with a little marking stick, paint the notch, and by other lines, outline a human face. Then the groove down the stick is painted red. Next the arrow-maker takes up the milk and with a wisp of buffalo wool rubs it over the plant and the entire surface of the stick, being careful not to get any of it into the grooves just painted red. As this proceeds they sing the usual ten steps (p. 46).

Then the arrow-maker ties the plant to the stick with sinew, placing it carefully just below the notch or face, and they sing to the usual ten steps (p. 46).

The stick is then passed around to all. They speak of it as a voice, the idea being that there is now life in it. When it again reaches the priest, he holds it up and blows his breath upon it, that the spirit of the people may pass into it. As in the steps of the Creation Ritual, the idea is that a human being is being created and that it is wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown] . Then the stick is passed about once again for all to blow their breath upon it.

When the stick is returned to the priest, he places it on the bundle. One of the assisting priests is sent out through the village to announce that the leading bundle priest lacks a covering for Mother. The people know that what is required is a new, spotless, unused young cowskin in the hair (i.e., not scraped). As the crying priest goes about, some man may remember that he has such a robe—may in fact have made a pledge to furnish it and provided himself with it. So he takes it by the head piece and, trailing it behind him, walks through the village. This is so that all may see that he is on the way and that no one else can have the right to provide the skin. As he nears the lodge, he throws the robe over his shoulder and enters, placing the robe upon the altar. He is then given a seat.

Again the crying priest goes out into the village, this time calling for the “moccasins and strings” for Mother. He also publicly announces who has just given the robe and adds various laudatory remarks. By “moccasins” is meant the covering for the bundle, for as has been previously stated (p. 46), the term has a symbolic meaning, i.e., something into which a germ of life can be thrust. For this bundle wrapping, a new tanned or scraped cowhide is needed. By “strings” is meant a buffalo-hair rope such as is found on bundles. Each time the ceremony is performed, it is expected that someone will provide these new wrappings. If no one does, the old ones would be returned, but when replaced they are given to an old man. The giver of the moccasins and string also drags the tanned hide along the ground and carries the rope to the altar.

When all is in place, the pledger of the ceremony is directed to make a smoke offering, after which sweetgrass is burned and all the objects purified. Then the bundle contents are wrapped in the tanned skin cover and laced with the rope. The stick bearing the corn plant is laid upon the top, but this time the sacred ear of corn is put on the head piece of the robe, and the latter rolled about it, allowing the tip of the corn to show. This is also tied and placed on top of the bundle.

The idea here is that Mother Corn may watch over the people during the growing season and that she may be readily approached to make offerings. If desired, she in her robe may be placed outside by the keeper during the day on a staff, that she may see better.

When the bundles have been made up, the leading priest says, “Now we are done; Mother is clothed and covered.” Then the other priests take charge, make the meat offering, and serve the food.

The stick bearing the corn plant remains on the bundle until the autumn ceremony of Changing Mother Corn (p. 104), when the part bearing the plant is cut off and placed under water, but the remaining portion is made into a pipe stoker for the bundle pipe.

The man giving the robe is addressed by the priest and reminded of his obligation. It will be recalled that the man giving the robe in the Corn Shelling Ceremony thereby became a holy man for the season (p. 74). He must do continual penance in order that the crops may be good. Now in just the same way, the giver of this robe becomes the guardian of the hunt for the season. From this time on, until Mother Corn is changed, he must remain in a state of nature, not washing, trimming his nails, etc. Neither must he scratch his head with his hand. He must do no work, but spend his time in eating and smoking. During the whole time, he is under the care of one of the priests, who sits with him, talks with him, and takes him out-of-doors when necessary. At no time must this holy man sing. He is responsible for the good fortune and well-being of the people; if they have a good season, he will thereafter be considered a holy man. If the buffalo fail, it is because he is unworthy or has violated some of the regulations.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Ritual238,Great Washing Ceremony,"Great Washing Ceremony

We now come to a very peculiar ceremony, the ritual for which belongs to the Big Black Meteoric Star bundle. Consequently, the leading bundle in charge now must give way to this bundle. Though the Big Black Meteoric Star bundle is one of the four leading ones, it can never lead in summer (p. 72), so a change in sequence is always necessary. This bundle is brought to the altar and its priest takes charge.

The Big Black Meteoric Star bundle has in it two ears of corn, four owl skins, an otter collar, a hawk, some reeds, paints, shells, native tobacco, one or two scalps, some buffalo meat and fat, and a few other things. There should be a meteorite also, but instead there is a disk made of pounded brass in which are two holes for the buckskin string. During the spring Thunder Ceremony, they tie the disk to the top of a little cedar pole about 4 feet [1.2 m] high and place it outside of the lodge entrance, which faces east.

A woman who formerly cared for the bundle told that one of its keepers, many years before they knew of white people, went west one time. Finally he came to a mountainous country. He climbed up a high peak and at the top he found a pipe and near it was this metal object. After he found these things he returned home to tell the people about them. That night he had a dream telling him to put these things in the bundle and how to use them in the ceremony.

On the outside of the bundle hangs the scalp of a buffalo, with the nose and eyes intact, but without horns. It was cut around the neck, the top taken off, and was split under the chin. This was then made into a bag. In this bag was kept a chart of the heavens (Figure 15). Formerly with the chart were two stones, the significance of which is not known; somebody must have taken them out for they are not in the bundle now. (The bundle is in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago.)

The native name for this ceremony is kirihciskucu[unknown] . “Washing off great’ seems to be the literal rendering of the phrase, but kiri refers to the thunders, the belief here being that the sound of many feet running to the water reminds one of thunder. Curiously enough, the word for sweathouse is kirihcisu[unknown] (washing off).

The principal feature of the ceremony is a footrace from the lodge to the bank of the stream. As participants in this, young and able-bodied men, practically nude, repair to the lodge and take seats behind their chiefs and bundles. When all are assembled, the priest selects a chief distinguished for his good qualities to act as bearer of the bundle pipe. Next he selects a brave known to be a good runner to act as bearer of the buffalo scalp containing the star chart. He takes the bag in his hand and sits by the door.

The priest then designates a chief’s aid, or soldier, to act as door keeper, who assures that no one starts before the signal to begin the race. Each bundle priest gives to each of the runners in his group an object from his bundle, excepting only the outer coverings, and the runners crouch, ready for the start. When the priests begin to sing the man at the door bearing the star chart bounds away with all at his heels. Outside are lined up all the village; all sexes and ages then join in the mad chase. If a runner overtakes the star chart bearer, he snatches it, and so on; thus the chart always leads.

[...]

The priests and the pipe-bearing chief remain in the lodge. The latter rises and with deliberation marches toward the water. He wears a fine new robe and holds the pipe in his left hand. He goes down the same pathway the others have followed and catches up with the stragglers, little boys three or four years old who are running along. He helps them along. They get to the creek with the other people. Then the crowd makes an opening for the chief. He puts his right-hand fingers in the water and makes a motion toward the pipe to the north four times. Then he takes the pipe in his right hand and repeats the motions with his left hand, with which he does not touch the pipe at all. He dips his right fingers into the water and passes them up and down the pipe and down his body; he then repeats the same with his left hand. As soon as he is through, he says, “Now you may wash.” They all go through the same motions with the objects they carry. The men and women who know their children are there go to them and make the same motions on the children. After that they may go into the water and swim all they want to. All the sacred objects are put through the same movements. The man with the chart makes the motions over it, and replaces it on his back. When he finishes, all the people who have sacred bundle objects follow him. The chief goes first. He leaves the men and women who want to swim, i.e., those who have no sacred objects; the other he leads back into the lodge. As the people enter the lodge they go to the bundles and return the objects; the bundle keeper is there to receive them. When they are all in place, the people sit down. They have a smoke ceremony in which a whiff of smoke is blown over each bundle. The leading priest makes a closing speech, stating that now all ceremonies are closed until the harvest, that everything has been washed and made pure so that the buffalo will not take flight as the hunters journey over the plains.

The contents of the bundles are then smudged and wrapped up. The attending priests make the meat offering and serve the food, as usual.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual239,Human Sacrifice to the Morning Star,"The Vision and the Capture

The human sacrifice was not carried on every year. Only when a man had a vision of the Morning Star commanding him to do so was it made. It was known by the older people that no man should attempt to make this human sacrifice unless he had a dream of the Morning Star and upon awakening found that the Morning Star was coming up over the eastern horizon. 

When a man has such a dream it is soon known throughout the village, for on going out of the lodge and seeing the Morning Star come up in the east, he at once begins to cry out in a loud voice. He then walks around the village several times, crying all the time, and finally goes into the lodge of the Morning Star priest. (There is but one priest of the Morning Star; he alone knows the ritual and the human sacrifice ceremony. He has assistants, but these men do not know the ritual. He can invite the four leading bundle priests if he chooses, and he can also invite the keeper of the Skull bundle, because the bow to kill the sacrifice is in the Skull bundle.) When the man enters the lodge of the Morning Star priest, he sits down close to the fireplace but not at the altar. He has his tobacco pouch and pipe there. The dreamer goes up to the priest, who knows why he is there, and puts his arms around him, still crying. Both begin to cry because they know what they have to do: one is to capture the sacrifice, the other to perform the ritual killing. They feel that it is wrong, they know it is wrong, but they are commanded by the Morning Star and must do it. After they stop crying, the priest tells the man to sit down. He takes up a little pipe that is already filled and they smoke together. After they are through, the priest says, “Tell me what has befallen you.” He wants the story of the dream.

The dreamer states that he dreamed he saw a man anointed with red ointment, with a buffalo robe wrapped around him, and leggings with scalps and eagle feathers. His head was decorated with soft down feathers and an eagle feather stuck through his scalplock. He had a warclub. He said, “I am coming to this man in a dream,” meaning that he is rising. “I want you to see how I look. I am the one that has power in the east. I am the big bright star. You people have forgotten about me. It is now time to offer a human sacrifice to me. I am watching over your people. You must rise, go to the man who knows the ceremony, and let him know. He will tell you what to do.”

The dreamer says “ I rose and went out. The Morning Star was up. I know that his commands must be obeyed; I know the hardships that I shall have to go through and have thought the whole thing over. I feel sad that it should fall upon me. I could not help but cry. Now I come to you.”

The priest fills the little pipe again and after lighting it goes outside of the lodge and offers the smoke to the Morning Star to make this man successful. He scatters the ashes outside, comes in, and sits down. They talk a little while.

The priest says, “Now I must take you out. You must take the pipe with you.” He fills the pipe again, gives it to the pledger, and tells him to go to the fireplace and light it. They go out of the lodge. The priest tells the dreamer to offer smoke to the Morning Star. He blows a whiff of smoke to it, asking the star to watch over him, that he may make no mistakes, and to take pity on him. When he is through smoking and talking, he empties the pipe, throws the ashes on the ground, and turns the pipe over to the priest, who then addresses the Morning Star. “Here is the man you have selected. I want you to notice him and know him.”

They return to the lodge and the priest says, “Now you must go to your own lodge; from this time on, you must not remain idle, but go out through the country. Stand on hills or sit on the lodge and always have in mind going out. It is left up to you when to start. When you are ready, come to me.”

The man returns to his lodge. It is rumored through the camp that he had a dream in which the Morning Star commanded him to capture a sacrifice. The men in the village watch wherever he goes. Finally he goes to the priest and tells him that he has made up his mind to arrange for the time when he shall set out for the enemy’s country. They sit and smoke. They decide that in four days he will tell his female family members to make several pairs of moccasins and to prepare anything else he may need for his journey. Most of the time he sits in the lodge with the priest.

Again, the people in the village hear that this man is to set out. So each man prepares himself, primarily by having several pairs of moccasins made. The women pound corn, roll it into balls, and put these into the new moccasins. Each is provided with a packet of parched corn. Then they call upon someone to pound pemmican for them. They can carry food in their extra moccasins only.

The dreamer goes into the lodge of the priest; while there, someone comes in and says, “Go out. I want to pack your moccasins and other things for you.” The dreamer thanks him, for he will have no time to get these things. Most of the middle-aged men in the village want to go on his war expedition to capture a sacrificial victim. The young men take no notice of what is going on because they are afraid.

On the fourth day the priest and the dreamer sit down. The priest takes down the Morning Star bundle and opens it. He takes out the otter collar, laying it to one side, the Mother Corn, and a hawk. There are two pipes in the bundle; he places the warrior’s pipe with the rest of the things. The priest and the pledger are alone; they have given orders that no one come into the lodge. The priest himself fills the pipe, lights it, and offers smoke to the pile of objects taken from the bundle. First he offers smoke to the main bundle and then to the warrior’s bundle.

The priest adds to the pile the soft down feathers that the dreamer is to wear, part of the skin of a wildcat, leggings filled with native tobacco, and paints. Four days are spent thus, during which time the priest tells him what to do on the journey. When they are through smoking, the priest puts to one side the objects he has taken from the Morning Star bundle, which he ties up and returns to its place on the wall. The warrior’s bundle now becomes the altar. With it are the ear of corn and the sacred pipe from the Morning Star bundle.

The man who is to carry the dreamer’s moccasins is now sent through the village to announce that a man is going on the warpath. He invites only certain men to come into the lodge. Great warriors who have previously been on the warpath are seated near the pledger. He selects a young man to act as his assistant. There are to be two leaders: The pledger is the main leader and sits at the south side; the assistant leader sits on the north side. When all are assembled, he informs them that he is about to go into the enemy’s country and asks if any of them wish to go. Everyone assembled volunteers. They go to their lodges and return with their equipment. They sit and smoke while the priest talks to the dreamer, telling him what to do on the journey.

After midnight the priest rises and goes out alone. When it is nearly time for the Morning Star to come up. the priest tells the dreamer it is time for them to set out. He asks the dreamer to rise. He gives him the buffalo-hair rope to tie around his waist and puts the otter collar on him; the hawk he fastens to his right shoulder, the ear of corn on the left, to the otter collar. He takes the red ointment and makes two streaks on either side of his face and marks a bird’s foot on his forehead. The priest hands him the pipe and tells him to carry it in his left hand when on a journey. If he should become tired, he may arrange his robe in such a way that he can carry the pipe on his back with the stem pointing upward. Now the priest goes out. Just as the Morning Star comes up, he takes the dreamer out of the lodge and faces him toward the star, saying, “Here is this man. He is now wearing your clothing. He is ready to start. Protect him and make him successful.” Then he leads the dreamer around in the lodge, around the fireplace, faces him toward the entrance, and directs his assistant to step alongside. The four warriors who are to act as leading scouts simply fall in behind. Those who are to act as fire makers and cooks come last in the procession. The priest tells them to start. They travel 15 or 20 miles [24-32 km] or until full daylight. When they come to a thickly wooded spot, they lie down and sleep. In the afternoon they resume their march. They camp at a timbered stream.

Camp must be made according to a fixed formula. As soon as they reach a desirable camping spot, they clear it. They make a little fireplace in the center. The dreamer takes off his regalia and otter collar and puts them west of the fireplace as an altar. The other men may talk and say anything they wish, but the leader (dreamer) sits at the altar all the time. Here they all sit down in the order of their rank and cosmic affiliation; the men who are to act as firemakers sit near the entrance. After they have cooked and eaten, the leader tells them to lie down and sleep, which they do in their places. He sits up and once in a while fills his pipe and smokes. He is the last man to lie down. Before the Morning Star rises, the four men who are to act as scouts go out into the country. Shortly before the Morning Star actually rises, the leader wakes the party by reciting a ritual. This ritual is given in full under the New Fire Ceremony (p. 140).

They go out and stop to rest about noon. At that time the four scouts come to tell them what they have seen. This routine is followed from day to day. When they see signs of an enemy, they go slowly. The scouts are always in the lead. Finally when the scouts find a village, they go around it and see how many tipis there are, etc. Then they run back and notify the leader.

The party now goes into the timber, where they clear a place, pull up all the grass and weeds, and make a circle just like a lodge. The first place cleared is where the leader’s regalia are to be placed as an altar. Then they make a fireplace, as in a lodge. They dig the dirt out from the fireplace and place it outside the circle on a mound.

The leader asks them to hunt for a buffalo skull. When they find one, they place it on the north side of the fireplace. Then he says, “Men, you have some presents that you may wish to offer to the gods. You may bring them to the altar.” They pile the gifts at the altar. He tells the two errand men to get 16 good-sized willows. To these they tie calico, beadwork, otterskin, or anything they have to offer. The leader says, “It is now time to offer tobacco to the gods in the heavens.” Selecting a man to make the tobacco offering, as in the stick ceremony (p. 59), the leader takes the tobacco from the wildcat bag and whispers to him where to place it. This done, he says, “Now we must offer the smoke.” He goes through the usual smoke offering procedure, except that the man stands west of the fireplace and blows whiffs of smoke to the different directions instead of going out to the different stations (Figure 10). When they are through, he tells them to prepare their meal. The errand man is sent out to take up the offering sticks and conceal them in the grass. When they have eaten, he directs the fire makers to make fire in the fireplace.

Now they are seated and they converse. During the night scouts are sent out. When they return and report to the leader that a suitable village has been located, the leader prepares for a ceremony. He first addresses the men, repeating in a formal and ritualistic style the substance of the reports; then he says, “Now we will sing.” He asks his assistant and two warriors to help him sing, and all the others to dance. He tells the fire keepers to make a big fire because he knows that if there are any enemies about they cannot see it. The leader sings, “The power of the earth goes through the enemy’s country; the power of the timbers goes through the enemy’s country.” They sing another song to which they dance: “This is the way I do when I am imitating, when I become angry or I am imitating.” He refers to imitating Morning Star. They sing this to all the steps (p. 43). As they dance, they seem to attack the fire as if it were an enemy. Those who go close to the fire thus let it be known that they will try to be brave before the enemy when they are close to the lines.

They keep watch as they dance; and when the Morning Star is visible, the leader dances. He puts on his regalia and goes around the fireplace. His pipe and other regalia are ready. They start out, the scouts leading. As they journey along, they report to the leader. They go to the west side of the enemy village and offer some native tobacco to the Morning Star. The leader prays, “Here is the enemy. Make my men brave. May I lose none of them. You must watch over us.” Then he gives orders for his assistant to lead some of the men around to the south side. He says, “I will give the wolf cry; then all prepare to make the attack. When I give the second wolf cry, give a war whoop and attack the village. Do not kill. As soon as you find a girl thirteen years old, lay your hand on her and pronounce her holy for the big star. 63   The others must assist him to bring her directly to me. Then leave the village. Do not harm any of the other people.”

Next he directs the four scouts to seek the ponies and drive them where he is standing, so that when they take captives, the ponies may be ready. Now he makes the wolf cry, and then another. The men give the war whoop and attack the village. The scouts drive the ponies to the leader. They have a fine pony ready for him. The others attack the village, but do not kill unless it is necessary. They capture a girl. Their work is done; they run back to the leader, and each man catches a pony. The man who captured the girl brings her up and says, “Leader, I pronounce her holy. She is to be the big star’s sacrifice.” The leader tells him to catch a pony and take her up behind.

Captivity and Sacrifice

They journey all day and rest at night for about three hours, then go on again. Finally, they approach their village; as they do so they set the prairie afire. The warriors take the soot from the burned grass and paint their faces black. Then they ride back and forth on a high hill, the leader behind them. They shout and yell. At this the village turns out to meet them, and as they come they shout to the people. “We have been successful. We have the captive.”

The priest comes up and the captive is turned over to him. The priest gets the pony she is riding. They go into the village, and the warriors tell how many times they counted coup (i.e., struck the enemy), how many were killed, etc. The women have scalp and victory dances. The leader does not go at once to his own lodge, but to the lodge of the priest and turns over to him his regalia, which are placed in the Morning Star bundle. Then they sit down, and while sitting there, they send for a man descended from the Wolf bundle keeper. A hereditary office, it is his duty to guard the captive. Before he can take charge of the captive, however, the women are asked to leave the lodge. Then they make smoke from buffalo fat mixed with sweet-grass. They take the captive to this smoke and let the smoke pass over her. The priest holds his hands in the smoke and passes his hands over her. He takes her to the altar and tells the Wolf man, who is to be the keeper of the captive, to pass himself through the smoke too. He must be as cunning as a wolf in order to take care of her. The priest anoints the girl’s whole body with the red ointment and then takes from the bundle the dress, a buffalo calfskin that comes a little below her knees, that she is to wear. The waist is folded up and a buffalo-hair rope wound tightly around her waist to hold her skirt in. He places a little soft down feather on top of her head, black moccasins on her feet, and gives her a new robe. Now they tell the Wolf man to take her to his lodge and to take care of her. But before he takes her out, the priest goes to the bundle in which are a little bowl and a little buffalo horn spoon prepared for the captive. When eating she must use these. Before they go, the priest tells the Wolf man that every day he must take the girl to the leader so that the latter can give her something to eat at his lodge. She must always carry her wooden bowl and spoon. The priest asks the leader, “Have you any buffalo meat?” He replies that he has none. “Go through the village to your friends and relatives and find out if they have any. In case they have none, you must go on a buffalo hunt, to consecrate buffalo cows.” When they obtain the buffalo meat, they are ready for the ceremony. If, however, the Morning Star is not showing, they must wait until the star that has a big bright red light appears; then they may proceed.

The daily routine of the people proceeds in the usual way. If the captive was taken in the fall, then during the winter buffalo hunt the pledger seeks a certain buffalo. When the scouts return and tell of a herd of buffalo at a certain place, the pledger goes to the priest and asks how he should be dressed to kill a buffalo for the ceremony. The priest tells him to anoint himself with red ointment; that is all. He decorates the mane and tail of his horse with eagle feathers. He goes out with the other hunters, but when they make a dash at the buffalo, they keep away from him, for he is the one to perform the ceremony of sacrificing the captive girl and so should have the first chance.

He finds a fat cow; as he takes the arrow to shoot at it, he says, “It is consecrated to the big star.” Whether he kills it with one shot or not, the other people keep away from it. Later when they see the arrow there, they also keep away. When he kills the buffalo, he skins it, spreads the hide on the back of the pony, puts the meat on it, and puts the fore legs with the feet upward in front, at the shoulders of the pony. He places the hindquarters with the feet upward too. Then he leads the pony into the camp. The people know that that meat is to be prepared for the human sacrifice ceremony.

His wife now takes the heart and tongue and dries them—they always have a frame for drying meat—and the rest of the meat she jerks and puts on the frame to dry in the sun. She takes good care of the meat, and when it is dried she puts it in a parfleche, ties it up, and whenever they camp she hangs it out to dry in the sun.

When the people return to the village, the priest watches. When the big star is the Morning Star, he tells the pledger it is time for the ceremony. The priest tells the warrior leader to dismiss all the people from his lodge and have them take their belongings with them. He must have the beds removed and the lodge swept out. The rim of the fireplace is rebuilt. They bring many cedar limbs and throw them into the fire. The Morning Star bundle is then brought in by the keeper. The pledger is to furnish everything. His lodge must be used because it is eventually to be burned.

The bundle is hung up on the west wall of the lodge. The warrior leader is told to invite the four leading priests and the four assistants of the pledger. These men come in. The priest takes his seat at the altar with the other four: two on his right and two on his left. One of these on the left is the priest of all the bundles, the Evening Star priest.

The bundle is taken down and the warrior’s clothing taken from it and placed on one side of the altar. The priest then tells the pledger to come to the altar, bring some coals, place the ointment mixed with sweetgrass upon them, and let the smoke envelop him, and return to his place. The priest then recalls the pledger to the altar, gives him the red ointment, and tells him to cover his face, his head, and his body with it. While the priest is giving these instructions for his dress, the other men go through the smoke.

Now the priest gives to the pledger the scalp belt, which is an otter hide about 8 inches [20 cm] wide and full length, from head to tail, but trimmed on each side. One side of the belt is folded with scalps hung from it. The priest ties the belt round the pledger’s waist, gives him the warclub, and directs him to run through the village telling his relatives that he needs mats, wood, food, etc. So the pledger runs out of the lodge. He has the feather stuck through his scalplock. He goes through the village; at the lodges of his own relatives, he enters on the run, telling them what he needs for the people. They know at once that the ceremony is to begin, and the women take new unused mats into the lodge. They lay two at the altar, one where the old men are to sit and one where the Morning Star bundle is to rest. They lay all the other mats round the circle of the lodge. When they have enough, those mats that are left are divided among the priests.

Now the women come in carrying on their backs wood, which they pile on each side of the entrance until it reaches the side wall. They also cook corn and buffalo meat. When they were hunting buffalo, not only the pledger, but also his brothers and uncles killed other buffalo and dried the flesh. Parfleches of this meat are now brought into the lodge and are piled up west of the priest. They take one of these parfleches and set it at its usual place at the south side near the entrance.

The chief of the Morning Star village comes in and sits on the northwest side near the Morning Star priest, who asks the warrior leader if he has anything prepared to place where the Wolf man and girl are to sit. The errand man is sent out to his people and they bring in half a buffalo bull robe, which they spread on the south side at the place of the Wolf Star man (Figure 14). Then two cushions which have been prepared are placed on it. These are made of buckskin stuffed with deer hair.

It is now time for the Wolf man and girl to come in. They enter the lodge and are given seats where the cushions are. The Wolf man sits on the east side of the cushions and the girl on the west side. She has her bowl and horn spoon. The Wolf man rises, takes the girl, and puts her through the smoke; then he himself passes through the smoke. Other men come in now and are given seats, according to their rank and according to the place for their bundles (Figure 14).

Now four rings are marked on the floor of the lodge—one at the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. Each ring is made a little larger than the fireplace; it is marked with the toe of a moccasin, the marker standing in the center of the ring and reaching out as far as he can. Then they take some of the down feathers out of the bundle and spread them around in the grooves marked out.

The girl and the Wolf man sit on the south side of the lodge, so they can be under the Wolf Star, which watches over the girl. Several old men sit there and when there is a pause in the ceremony or a rest period, it is their function to talk to the couple.

A fire is made in the lodge and four long poles—one each for the southeast, southwest, northwest, and northeast, and pointing towards the rings—are laid in it. On the northeast is an elm pole; on the southwest, a box elder; on the northwest, a cottonwood; and at the southeast, a willow. As the ends of these poles burn away, they are pushed into the fire.

The warrior leader is seated on the south side. Kettles of corn are put on the east side. The chief priest is the last man to go through the smoke offering. The bundle contents are taken and passed through the smoke after that. Finally the priests put red ointment all over their bodies.

The ceremony begins. The Evening Star priest presides and begins with two songs from the ritual of the Evening Star bundle. After these songs there is a pause, during which the Evening Star priest returns to his seat. The Morning Star priest now takes charge, and they begin to sing the songs to lead the way for the Morning Star Ceremony. There are 21 songs which have been recorded for the ceremony. Songs 1-4 are introductory ones about Mother Corn; they tell of her presence during the proceedings. Songs 5-17 comprise the Morning Star ceremony proper, while the last four songs (18-21) come from other ceremonies. Two of the latter (viz., 18 and 19) are sung during the meat offering, and one other (20) is used when the sacrificial victim is painted.

The Morning Star priest begins with the first (p. 125) and second (p. 126) Morning Star songs. In the evening they rest and partake of food. At night they sing the third song (p. 126), after which the Wolf man conducts the girl to the altar. The warrior leader gives the red ointment to the priest, who covers the girl with it again, and they return to their seats. (My informant does not know what they do after that, but they sit there all night.) The next day the procedure is the same as for the first day.

The following day men crowd about the lodge. There are many of them, and they tear the dirt off the lodge to make holes so that the people can look in. And in the process they practically destroy the lodge. Once in a while, when they sing during the ceremony, the priest tells the warrior leader to rise and dance. Sometimes others dance. He takes up one of the four poles, which are kept burning during the ceremony. Taking the northeast pole with the fire at one end, he dances up to the girl and points it at her right side, but does not touch her. He dances toward her again and points the pole at her left side. Next with the southwest pole he points under her arm, but does not touch her. Then he takes up the other poles in succession.

Now during the third day the priest sends four men into the timber to cut poles. They must get the poles and select a place for the sacrifice scaffold. The two upright posts for the scaffold are to be cottonwood; four others are to be willow, cottonwood, box elder, and elm. The cross bars are to be willow. When they have the proper poles, these people select a place a mile or two [1.6-3 km] east of the village, where they place the poles and return to the village to notify the priest. He gives them strings cut from bear, mountain lion, wildcat, and wolf hides and sends one of the priests to instruct them in the building of the scaffold. They build this while the ceremony proceeds.

Under the scaffold is dug a rectangular hole about 5 inches [13 cm] deep. The bottom is covered with soft down feathers, upon which the blood of the sacrifice is to drip. As we shall see, the important point in the procedure is the dropping of the victim’s blood upon the meat to be offered. If the captive fails to bleed freely, it is a bad omen.

On the fourth day they still sing in the lodge. The girl is fed whenever the others eat and is taken out once in a while to walk around with the Wolf man, who sits by her. The leading priest wears his regalia; he is anointed and wears leggings decorated with scalps. He rises, dances around the lodge on the north side, around the south, and then back to the altar. Again he circles the lodge, dancing. When he reaches a point opposite the entrance, he whirls round, dances to the northeast ring and around it, destroying it and scattering the feathers through the lodge. He dances up to the southwest ring and destroys that too. Then he dances to the northwest and destroys that ring; then to the southeast ring, destroying it as well. They sing all afternoon, until it is night, at which time they sing the fifth song (p. 127). It tells of the powers in the heavens looking down upon the ceremony. The song is sung four times, each time with a different relationship term being substituted. Thus, “the grandfather is looking down,” is followed by stanzas with “father,” “uncle,” and “brother” occurring in place of “grandfather.” The sixth song (p. 127), referring to ceremonies on the warpath and the power of the earth that has gone through the enemy’s country, is sung. It is then followed by the seventh song (p. 127), which tells about the feelings of a warrior when he is about to attack a sighted enemy: He becomes angry or ferocious. In the seventh song they sing the first four of the woman’s steps and six of the man’s (p. 43), after which the man rises to wipe out the rings. Each time the leading priest wipes out a ring, there is a grunting sound through the lodge as if they were attacking an enemy. It means that the dancer, like a warrior, goes around the earth and through the timber.

They are seated. They take the girl up to the altar once more and paint her, covering her right side with red ointment, and painting her left side black, so that she is half red and half black. During this time they sing the first stanza of the eighth song (p. 128) four times to the first four woman’s steps (p. 43): earth, timbers, waters, and seeds. They pause and sing the second stanza of the eighth song (p. 128) six times to the following man’s steps: moccasins, moccasin string, robe, wonderful, Mother Corn, and bluebird [i.e., everything that is under the heavens].

Following this song they take a tanned hide that has been dyed and place it on the girl’s shoulders while singing the ninth song (p. 128). She is now wearing a skirt of the same kind. They say, “You now wear the robe belonging to Grandfather Meteorite. You have the covering belonging to Father Meteorite. You have the covering belonging to Uncle Meteorite. You have the covering belonging to Brother Meteorite.” They also place a row of erect feathers on the median line of her head so as to stand out fan-like, as do those on the calumet stick (Fletcher, 1904:37-42). Again they take her to her place and she sits down on her cushion. The Wolf man is very kind to her. The priests sing the tenth song (p. 129) ten times, to the usual four woman’s steps and the six man’s steps (p. 43): “It was the flying power who gave you the earth. It was the flying power who gave you the timbers. It was the flying power who gave you the waters. It was the flying power who gave you the seeds. It was the flying power who gave you strings to tie, etc.” Flying power signifies Evening Star.

After these songs they take up their gourd rattles again and sing the eleventh song (p. 129), substituting the usual woman’s and man’s steps: “The earth flowing with milk they are making: The earth covering with soft down feathers.” (When they sing of the earth flowing with milk, they speak figuratively of placing the soft down feathers on the earth.) “The timbers with soft feathers they are making you. “The second stanza is about the moccasins with soft down feathers. They still imitate the thunders in the singing.

The fundamental concept in all of these rituals is that the powers in the heavens cause everything by their wish or will. So it was in the creation of the first child to be placed upon the earth. The bundle itself is symbolic of the creation. The cover is the flora, or the covering, of the earth. The seeds are the elements of life wrapped in this covering. So in the wrappings of the bundle are the seeds covered. The most important contents of these coverings, from the Indian’s point of view, are the corn and the buffalo. Again, the first child created was wrapped in a robe and placed upon the earth for the storms and water to uncover. It is also said that the sacrifice in this ceremony symbolizes this first child. It is further conceived that with the creation the world was charged with power or potentiality for good and is ready to give forth benefits to all men.

After the twelth song (p. 129) is sung, the priest lays down the rattles and takes up the sacred pipe from the bundle. (Among the decorations to this pipe is a woven belt of Navajo or other southwestern origin.) The bowl of this pipe is of red stone. If it is daytime, tobacco is taken from the bag made of eagle skins; if night, from that of wildcat. A special pipestick is provided with a large paddle-shaped head. This is also used with the small warrior’s pipe in the bundle and so carried to war. The present stick has a number of notches cut into it, recording horses captured when it was carried to war.

After the regular smoke ceremony is performed, the pipe is taken apart and returned to the bundle, whence follows the procedure of putting the important parts of the bundle through the smoke.

An assistant is given sweetgrass, which he chops up fine with a knife and mixes with buffalo fat, rolling it into a ball. The errand man is then sent out for a shovel and a stick, with which he takes a few coals of fire from the fireplace, and deposits them at a point on the south side of the lodge. In the meantime, the kettles of food for the feast are brought in. The important point is that until the objects in the bundle have been put through the smoke, no one may pass between the food and the fire.

The ball of fat and sweetgrass is now put upon the coals, and as the smoke rises the attendant brings the sacred objects one by one. Standing on the north side of the fire, he puts them through the smoke four times. He first takes the bow, the quiver, the Cheyenne medicine arrow, and the bag to the pipe. These are then handed to the man sitting on the south side who is to shoot the sacrifice. Then come in succession the pipe and the ear of corn, the owlskins, the other birds, the otter collar, the scalp belt, and the counting sticks, handed alternately to the men on the right and left of the holder of the bow. Now the leading priest takes up the buffalo skin cover to the bundle that it may be put through the smoke. It should be noted that during the winter the head of the skin is turned toward the north and in summer to the south. If it is now time for the change, the priest so manipulates the cover as it is returned. Finally the rattles are put through the smoke, and the officiating assistant adds a climax to the procedure by putting himself through the smoke.

Now the objects are returned to the bundle, care being exercised that they all point in the right direction.

Following this all the men seated in the lodge, in order, put themselves through the smoke, thus bringing themselves good fortune. Last of all come the priests.

Now, as usual in ceremonies, women who gave food may request the recital of the accompanying ritual (p. 152) and names may be changed.

When all is over the errand man goes to the smoke, puts himself through, then puts the coals and ashes back into the fireplace and stamps out all traces with his foot. At this point two songs are sung preparatory to the feast. The time should now be midnight, or after, and a recess is taken, after which is sung the thirteenth song (p. 130) concerning the dressing of the warrior and the captive for the sacrifice. It was learned through visions or dreams that Morning Star was clothed like the warrior described in the thirteenth song. He stands upon the earth, upon the power of Grandfather Meteor (line c). In singing this they go as far down the scale their voices will carry. When they get to the last stanza the warrior (dreamer) stands clothed with Grandfather Meteor’s clothing and so has his power—i.e., stands there representing Morning Star, the god of war.

The getting of moccasins, strings, and robe for the captive recalls the corresponding steps. When the captive is dressed in the black moccasins, etc., she is wa[unknown]ruksti[unknown] ‘holy’ through the power of Mother Corn and Hawk.

When this song is sung, the singers and people all cry. (Our informant shed tears when he sang this.) They seem to be pathetic songs that move those who hear them and know the meaning. When the thirteenth song is completed, the men strike downward four times with the gourds and lay them down. Once in a while, the warrior leader rises and takes up each of the poles at the fireplace in its order, commencing with the northeast clockwise. He points at the girl, but never touches her. They take up the gourds again. The priest takes up braided elkhide thongs and tells the warrior leader to come to him. He hands the thongs to the warrior to tie the girl’s wrists, and again they sing (fourteenth song, p. 131) a series of stanzas dealing with tying the sacrifice.

Now she is tied sitting down.
Now she arises as she is tied.
The tie is complete.
On the fourth day, one of the priests goes out, climbs the lodge, and announces that all men, young men, young boys, and male babies must now make their bows and arrows. Even a male baby must have a little bow and arrow. The men, of course, have theirs; the young boys make their own with blunt points, as the babies’ arrows are also made. The girl stands with the thongs on her hands. It is almost daylight. The four priests, taking the four leading bundles, have gone out and returned. They are now dressed in their ceremonial regalia too.

The Yellow Star bundle priest has taken two owl skins from the bundle and is wearing them on his back. He then borrows the bow that is in the Skull bundle and provides one arrow (red). The Red Star bundle priest also wears owls, but he has one of the poles with coals at the end. The White Star bundle priest has the warclub; he also has on his back owls that belong to this bundle. The fourth leading bundle priest, Big Black Meteoric Star, now has the Morning Star’s flint knife and also has owls on his back.

The four men who are assistant priests attend these men. One now rises. The Morning Star priest instructs the Wolf man to assure that the girl makes the required movements as they are sung in the songs. Then the warrior leader is dressed with the scalp belt, otter collar, and the pipe in his hand.

The leading priests stand there and rattle their gourds and sing (Figure 19). Then the whole procession leaves the lodge and proceeds toward the scaffold. The Wolf man and the girl are in the lead, the warrior leader behind them, the four priests, then the chiefs, then the warriors, and finally the common people. As the procession marches out of the lodge, the four leading bundle priests must hide their weapons.

The fifteenth song (consisting of 17 stanzas) is concerned with the march to the scaffold. The first stanza tells that her spirit is alive for a short time only; the second states that she is looking around with her eyes for a short time only. Subsequent ones enumerate her activities as she proceeds from the lodge to the scaffold.

Dawn is coming. The scaffold is ready. The two uprights are cottonwood, the overhead pole is willow; the pole the girl is to stand on is also willow; the next pole is cottonwood, then box elder, and the next elm. She must stand between the two willows, for they are water trees. At the top are tied otterskins, because the otter is a water animal. At the lower willows on which she is to stand are wolf skins, then mountain lion, bear, and wildcat in that order. She is to climb the scaffold like a ladder.

It is now sunrise. The whole village is present. When they reach the scaffold, they pause. The maiden sees the scaffold and is afraid, but the Wolf man pleads with her and coaxes her to ascend. (The idea seems to be that the captive must proceed in all things of her own free will. Hence, the Wolf man is credited with great skill in inducing her to do all the necessary things, in particular, to climb the frame.) He finally persuades her to start and they sing about her climbing the scaffold (sixteenth song, p. 133). She climbs up and they sing the first stanza four times, again for the four different heavenly powers. She reaches the top; he ties her wrists to the last pole. She is facing east. As she stands on the crosspiece, they sing. The mounting of the scaffold is now complete. The four leading priests and the warrior stand ready in the four directions, hiding in ravines or depressions. A man carrying one of the burning poles from the fire runs up from the ravine and feigns to touch her on each side under the arms and on the loins, then runs back to the ravine. Another man comes up with the bow and arrow and shoots her through the side, striking the heart.

Now the Morning Star is coming up. The man with the flint knife approaches, gives a war whoop, and climbs the scaffold. He cuts a small opening over the heart, puts his hands into the cut, and with four movements puts the marks of blood on his own face. Then he runs down into the ravine. In the meantime, a man appears carrying meat consecrated for this ceremony. He has the meat from a whole buffalo, the heart and tongue on top. With the dried meat in his arms, he goes to the scaffold and there holds it under the scaffold to catch some of the drops of blood. If the blood does not drip on the meat, bad luck for all will follow, for it is a bad omen. Further, none of the blood must be allowed to drip upon the soft down feathers below the scaffold. (A very small cut is made, as but a few drops of blood are desired. The heart is not exposed or removed.)

Finally comes the man with the warclub. He makes four feints at each of the four points of the body and then touches her upon the heart. As he does so he gives a war whoop and runs away. The idea is that by this blow the spirit of the sacrifice leaves her to go up into the heavens to become one of the stars, where she will watch over the people for whom she died.

In the meantime the priests of the other bundles have kindled a fire nearby, to the southeast. This is a new fire, made by the priest of the Evening Star bundle, using the firesticks in the bundle. When the blood has ceased to drip upon the meat offering, its bearer wheels around and goes to the fire, circles the fireplace four times, and standing west of it, raises the meat toward the heavens, lowers it gradually, and drops it into the fire where it burns, the idea being that the smoke will go up to the heavens.

Now the men and boys come up and begin to shoot the sacrifice in the back. As they shoot her, they sing war songs, etc., and some run to the village to tell what they have done. Even the children are told to shoot. At last there are so many arrows in her back that there is room for no more. Even the mothers of little children shoot small arrows for them. The people move around; some of them run to the fireplace and go round and round; withal there is much shouting.

A procession of all the people is then formed and, led by the priest, circles the scaffold and the fire where the meat offering is burning. The priests then sing (not recorded here), “Let the sacrifice alone,” and send the people home.

It is daylight. Morning Star has seen the whole performance. The four men chosen as assistants to the priests now come forward, untie the body, take it down, and carry it about a quarter of a mile from the scaffold onto the prairie, where they lay it face downward with head to the east. The men sing the final (17th) song (p. 134). “The earth you shall become a part of,” i.e., she will turn into or become a part of the earth through this great ceremony. The idea is that all the animals in the song shall now become a part of her because some of them will come out from her and others shall eat of her.

Then these men return to the lodge. There is general rejoicing and jollification through the village. The women get out their husband’s warbonnets, spears, etc., and go in mimic war parties around the village. Men and women dance.

The participants go back into the ceremonial lodge, where the parfleche of meat and other things are taken out, and they eat. There are some additional songs for the return to the lodge after the sacrifice, which I did not secure. Now when seated they first sing about the knife (18th song) for cutting the meat and then make the usual offering (19th song). After the feast the leading priest makes an address. The ceremony is over and the people are dismissed.

We have now given as full an account of the sacrifice as the data available permit. The greater part of the songs have been preserved so that I can give their texts here. The carrying out of the ritual required four days. The following rambling statement of an informant gives a general outline of the basic beliefs from which the ritual was formulated:

Each star after it was placed in the heavens by Tirawahat himself was given power to watch over the people. The common stars themselves had once been people. Morning Star had to overcome Evening Star in order to create the earth. After the people were placed upon the earth, each star gave a bundle to various bands of people. They did not know anything about it, but the Pumpkin Vine Village knew their ritual as also did Wolves Standing In Water. This first man, in planning out the Evening Star bundle, brought all the bundles together. He said, “You in your sacrifice must sacrifice scalps, because the minor gods in the heavens demand that; but Morning Star wants a human sacrifice as his due. He has given you a girl from whom the people came. Now you must return her to him. Evening Star wants only an enemy’s hair and the buffalo heart and tongue.”

The girl from the heavens was placed on the earth by the rainstorms. She ran to and fro, her ear bones trembling (i.e., kept moving her head round to see if she could hear something). From this girl came a great people. They had to leave their first grass lodge. The poles were left in the ground for the buffalo to rub on. They were required to consecrate buffalo and to bring into the village a captured maiden to be sacrificed.

At the time of the flood there were four animals who touched the heavens. As the waters rose, they stood on solid ground beneath. But from the north came a big turtle, who said, “I will destroy them.” So he got under the water nearby, and the animals stepped on the turtle’s back thinking it was earth and then slipped off to drown. As each one fell over, it said, “The people shall say, ‘West, east, north, south.’ ”

There is always a man in the ceremony to handle the counting sticks from the bundle. He keeps tally of the songs as they are sung. They speak of this as gambling with the Morning Star. Thus one will say, “Now we are about to win, for there are but a few sticks left.”

When all the sticks have been sung over to the people’s side, they say, “Now we have won and can go on with the sacrifice.”

These sticks are said to be symbolic of one’s life struggle as one wrests his life from the gods in the heavens. He also wrests his achievements from the unlucky powers. Hence, in the ceremony the idea is that they are winning from the gods by singing over the counting sticks to the people’s side.

The set of sticks is kept in the Morning Star bundle for this purpose. No other bundle has them, but in the Thunder Ceremony the songs are counted with ordinary sticks in much the same way.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Ritual240,The Smoke Offering,"Putting Life into the Animals

When they are through and are seated, Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “Brothers, now we are through with our mothers; our breaths are in them and we now possess power from them. When their voices are sounded, the diseases in our village will be driven away. We will now proceed with the ceremony by offering smoke from our pipes to the gods in the heavens, to the animal lodges upon the earth, and to the deceased doctors whose talk and voices are before us [refers to the rim of the fireplace]. I will first make the smoke offering to the animal.” He fills the little pipe with native tobacco, rises, walks to the fireplace, going around by the south, then as he comes around by the northeast, stops. He approaches the fire, takes a stick with a coal on the end, places the coal upon the pipe, and smokes. When the pipe is lit, he lays the stick back into the fire and walks back (west) to the altar. He now kneels before the animal and blows four whiffs to its mouth. As he blows each whiff, he holds the mouthpiece of the pipe to the mouth of the animal. He prays to the animal silently, for he does not speak out. When he has given four whiffs, he empties the ashes from the bowl of the pipe under the head of the beaver. He takes in his right hand some of the ashes from the bowl and spreads them upon the animal’s head. He also takes some of the ashes in his left hand and spreads these upon the animal’s head. He then passes his hands over the pipestem, twice with his right and left hands, and then passes his hands over the beaver in the same manner. He passes his right hand over the pipestem, then places his right hand over his mouth and inhales. Then he takes the pipe in his right hand, passes his left hand over the pipestem, places his hand again over his mouth and inhales, believing he is inhaling power from the animal. He takes his seat behind the altar, then places the pipe crosswise behind the animal. (The pipe must lie crosswise, for someone might walk in front of it and cut off the spirit from the pipe.)

Now Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “Brothers, the animal now lies before you with power. It is looking around the lodge, its looks resting on each one of you. Whatever the animal feels like doing for you, it will do. It now has power to help you and your roots and herbs cure people. If it so desires, you will be blessed with many presents. If any of you doctors are waiting upon the sick, this animal will help you call upon it. I will now leave it with you.” As Raruhwa[unknown]ku stops speaking, several men arise and go to the altar with presents of calico. As they near the altar, Raruhwa[unknown]ku reaches for the beaver and lifts it up. They place the presents upon the wooden altar and then he places the animal upon it. The men stand in line. The first man kneels before the beaver and says: “Now, father, I am poor; take pity upon me. I want your help to cure the sick. Keep sickness from our village. Give me good gifts and long life.” He arises and takes his seat. Other men do the same thing, each praying to the animal that they and their children may be blessed.

When all (except the chiefs) have prayed to the beaver, Raruhwa[unknown]ku speaks again: “Brothers, something is at hand now. The gods in the heavens have received our tobacco; the water animals and animal lodges have received our tobacco; the birds in the heavens have received our tobacco. Now they are awake in their power. It is time to make the smoke offering our fathers were taught by the animals. We will also make a smoke offering to our deceased doctors. I have filled the first pipe, which will be offered to one of the seven animal lodges at Pa[unknown]haku (Mound Sitting In Water) and to the gods in the heavens that watch over them. I take the pipe and select a man on the north side who will make the first smoke offering. I select White Horse (Figure 32), who will rise and give forth his voice to the gods in the heavens and to the different animal lodges dotted here and there.” White Horse throws off his blanket, rises, walks to the altar, and receives the pipe. He walks east, going along on the south side, and when opposite the entrance he stops. He is now facing east. He holds the bowl of the pipe with his left hand, the stem pointing away from him; he then points the pipe slantwise toward the east and with his right hand takes a little of the tobacco from the bowl of the pipe and offers it (slantwise) toward the east; then he drops the tobacco upon the ground. He turns about and goes to the west of the fireplace by way of the north, where with his left hand he holds the pipe straight up toward the heavens; and with his right hand he takes a little of the tobacco and lifts it to the heavens, then lowers his hand and places the tobacco upon the rim of the fireplace. He points the pipe west and takes a little of the tobacco; he holds it toward the west and then places the tobacco open the rim of the fireplace. Now he points the pipe upon the rim of the fireplace, takes a little tobacco from the pipe bowl, and places it upon the rim. He faces about and walks to the altar, stopping at it and pointing the stem of the pipe toward the animal. With his right hand he takes a little tobacco and places it upon the ground near the altar. Now he faces about, goes northeast of the fireplace by way of the south and around the fireplace to northeast. Here he is seated and holds the pipe with both hands, the mouthpiece in his mouth, and is ready to smoke. The south errand man now rises, takes the first stick on the fire, and places the coal upon the bowl of the pipe. White Horse now smokes, and as the smoke rises from the pipe, the errand man replaces the stick in the fireplace. White Horse rises, faces about, walks around the fireplace by way of the west and south to the east. Still smoking, he stops between the entrance and the fireplace; he faces east and gives four whiffs to that direction. As he draws the smoke from the pipe, he points the stem toward the east, then blows the smoke east along the pipe. Four times he does this. He goes southeast of the fireplace and blows one whiff of smoke upon the rim; to northwest and blows one whiff upon the rim; then to the west of the fireplace, and points the pipe upward to Tirawahat, giving one whiff to the heavens; then he faces west, points the pipe west and gives one whiff to that direction. He points the pipe to the fireplace and gives one whiff to the rim of it. He faces west and walks to the altar, giving four whiffs to the animal. Returning to the fireplace, he blows one whiff southwest upon the rim of it, one whiff south, and one whiff southeast.

From his position in the southeast, White Horse proceeds around the fireplace, going by way of the east and north to the west side. He offers the pipe to the first man on the north side, who takes a few whiffs; then offers it to the second man, who also smokes, taking a few whiffs, after which he takes the pipe, going around the fireplace by way of the north, east, south, then west to the altar on the south side and offers the pipe to the first man on the south side. After the latter takes a few whiffs, he offers the pipe to the second man on his right, who also takes a few whiffs; then he goes around the fireplace by the south, east, and north to the west to the fourth man (High Eagle), who takes a few whiffs; then White Horse goes around the fireplace by the north, east, south to the fourth man (White Thunder), who receives the pipe and smokes, taking a few whiffs; then he goes again to the north around the fireplace east and north to the fifth man (White Horse), who receives the pipe. (There should be another man here with White Horse, but there was none, so only one man smoked.) After White Horse takes a few whiffs, he goes to the seventh and eighth south men (Blue Hawk and Flying Eagle); and after Flying Eagle takes a few whiffs, Blue Hawk takes the pipe and smokes. Now White Horse goes to the northeast entrance, where the eighth and ninth men each receive the pipe and smoke; he goes to the southeast entrance, where, there being no old men at the place, the ninth and tenth men each receive the pipe and smoke a few whiffs; he goes to the northeast entrance, to the errand man, and offers him the pipe. After this errand man takes a few whiffs, he goes to the southeast to the other errand man, and offers him the pipe. The south errand man receives it, smokes, and gives the pipe back to the man again.

White Horse now goes by the north side around the fireplace and hands the pipe to Raruhwa[unknown]ku, the first man on the north side, and then sits down at his place. Raruhwa[unknown]ku draws a few whiffs and hands the pipe to the man on his left. The pipe goes on down the line until someone says: “The pipe is empty.” White Horse rises, takes the pipe, walks toward the fireplace, sits down, and draws a few whiffs; then he rises and walks west to the fireplace. He stirs the ashes in the bowl of the pipe, raises it toward the heavens, lowers it, and drops some of the ashes upon the rim of the fireplace. Now he turns to the west, points the pipe in that direction, and drops some ashes upon the rim of the fireplace; then he points to the rim of the fireplace and drops some ashes upon it. Now he wheels about, walks to the animal, and drops some ashes upon its head. He takes some of the ashes from the bowl of the pipe and spreads them upon the head. He takes a few steps from the altar and faces the west. He passes his right hand over the pipestem, then over his head. Holding the pipe in his right hand, he passes his left hand over the pipestem, then passes his hand over his head; again he takes the pipe in his left hand and passes his right hand over the pipe; then he passes his right hand upward upon his left arm. Now he takes the pipe in his right hand, passes his left hand over the pipe and upward upon his right arm. He starts east, taking three steps; then he whirls around suddenly and walks to the altar with the bowl of the pipe downward. Holding the pipe in his right hand, he hands the pipe to the first man on the north side [Beaver], who on receiving it places his right hand upon the elbow of the man with the pipe. Beaver passes his right hand down White Horse’s arm until he reaches his hand and with three distinct grips of the hands, he receives the pipe and says, “ Rawa .” All repeat “ Rawa .” Everybody knows by this exclamation that White Horse has gone through the smoke ceremony.

Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “The second pipe is now filled and now the second animal’s lodge, which is at Kicawi[unknown]caku (Spring On The Edge Of A Bank), will receive the smoke offering. I select Flying Eagle on the south side to go through the smoke offering. He will go through the same performance except that the north errand man will place the coal, taking the second stick on the fireplace.” This man goes through the smoke ceremony as did White Horse.

When this offering of smoke is over, Raruhwa[unknown]ku again says: “I have filled the third pipe and this smoke will be offered to the animals’ lodge at Paksu[unknown]ktu[unknown] (Head Covered With Soft Down Feathers), to the gods in the heavens, and to our deceased doctors. This ceremony will be gone through like the others. I select Fancy Eagle on the north side to make the smoke offering. The errand man must take the third stick to light the pipe.” Fancy Eagle arises, takes the pipe, and goes through the same ceremony.

Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “Brothers, I have filled the fourth pipe and this smoke will be offered to the animals’ lodge at Pa[unknown]hu[unknown][unknown]a (Swimming Mound), to the gods in the heavens, and to our deceased doctors. I select Blue Hawk on the south side. He will go through the smoke offering as before. The errand man will remember to take the fourth stick from the fireplace to light the pipe.” Blue Hawk rises, takes the pipe, and goes through the smoke offering as before. When he finishes, Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “I have filled the fifth pipe and the smoke from this pipe will be offered to the animals’ lodge at Ahka[unknown]iwa[unknown]waktiku (River Bank Talking, or Echos From The River Bank), to the gods in the heavens, and to our deceased doctors. I will select High Eagle on the north side. He will go through the smoke offering just like the first man; the errand man will remember to take the fifth stick from the fireplace and light the pipe.” This smoke offering is gone through as before.

Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “Now, I have filled the sixth pipe and the smoke from this pipe will be offered to the animals’ lodge at Kutawikucu Raka[unknown]wa[unknown]wi (Hawks’ Nest), to the gods in the heavens, and to our deceased doctors. The smoke offering will be gone through as before. The errand man will remember to take the sixth stick upon the fireplace and to light the pipe. I will now select White Thunder on the south side.” White Thunder goes through the smoke offering, and Raruhwa[unknown]ku says, “Brothers, we will not be long; now I have filled the seventh pipe and the smoke from this pipe will be offered to the animals’ lodge at Ahkawita[unknown]ka (White River Bank), to the gods in the heavens, and to our deceased doctors. This will end the smoke ceremony and the animals’ lodges will all have received our offering of smoke. They will be made glad, and their powers will be given us. The gods in the heavens are glad that we have offered them smoke and they will watch over us. The dead doctors have received our smoke offering; they will come to us in our ceremonies and will help us remember how to carry them on. I will now select Man Chief on the north side; he will go through the same ceremony as the others. The errand man will remember to take the seventh stick and light the pipe.” Man Chief went through the smoke offering like the others.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ritual246,Hunting Initiation,"Hunting Initiation

The ceremony of hunt initiation (ma˙′[unknown]′va˙Gi, or Gï Gi′Daηwa') appears to be a product of the intense Hopi interest in all phases of hunting. Though it nominally occurs in connection with rabbit hunting it may not be literally construed as initiation into rabbit hunting only, since formerly it was not customary for a youth to hunt larger game such antelope or mountain sheep without first being initiated on the rabbit hunting field. Such initiation was looked upon as a general hunting initiation and informants were concerned to stress the point that it did not concern rabbit hunting to the exclusion of the hunting of larger game. In this sense it is merely a continuation of the same interest in hunting that dictates the custom of cutting the umbilical cord of a boy on an arrow shaft and then wrapping the dried cord round the shaft before thrusting it into the roof beams of the house; all this that the boy may develop into a good hunter in after years.

Hunting initiation occurs when a boy kills his first jack rabbit (so˙′wi). He may have been going out with hunting parties for some time previously and have killed the cottontail rabbit (Da˙′vo) or the yellow cottontail (si˙′[unknown]ya Da˙′vo), but since these are considered easier to kill than the jack, initiation waits on the later event. When this occurs, the hunt is stopped and all the men gather round the boy. His father, or a kinsman if the father is not present, chooses the best hunter on the field to act as hunt father (ma˙[unknown] na˙′'aD) to the boy “because he wants the boy to be as good a hunter as this man.” As in the old days the men hunted clad only in breech cloth, pigment, and moccasins, so today the boy is stripped of his clothes. The men form a circle round him holding each other's wrist. A relative takes the boy by the shoulder and bends him forward with his back turned towards the north. The hunt father takes the dead rabbit and swings it across the boy's back from left to right leaving a blood mark on the flesh. This is done for the other three cardinal points, the boy's back being turned toward them anti-clockwise. The boy receives the rabbit, which he may later eat if he so wishes, and the hunt is resumed. During the next three days the boy may eat neither salt nor meat. Each morning before sunrise his hunt father takes him to Do˙ji˙′va spring below the mesa to bathe; both are unclothed save for a breech cloth. The father totally immerses the boy in the water four times each morning, gives the boy some of the water to drink and then presents him with four prayer sticks which the boy plants, one at each side of the spring in the four cardinal directions, praying at the same time for health, strength and skill as a hunter. This is done on each of the three mornings.

On the third day the boy's paternal aunts make a corn dish (Bi˙′[unknown]ami), and his mother makes hominy stew. In the evening a hunt is announced for the next day. On the morning of the fourth day the boy eats salt and meat in the stew, and a feast is held at his mother's house. He is then taken to the house of his hunt father's mother or sister. His hair is washed and he is given a new name, according to customary naming ritual, by the father's female relatives who also present the boy with gifts of piki and sweet corn food ([unknown]wï˙′mi). His hunt father presents the boy with two curved painted throwing sticks (Gï Gi′wu′Dz[unknown]ohï', the unpainted curved stick is Bu˙′dZ[unknown]ohï'), and dresses him in white ceremonial skirt, sash, and moccasins. Bells are tied about his waist, necklaces of turquoise are placed round his neck, and a bunch of white eagle and parrot feathers tied in his hair. The boy's body is also painted with a broad yellow line across the chest from shoulder to shoulder and short parallel horizontal yellow lines are painted above and below the elbow of each arm and above and below the knee of each leg. Each cheek is painted with two vertical lines of red ochre. White meal is rubbed over the rest of the face. The hunt father dresses in ceremonial skirt and moccasins, with a feather in his hair. His body is painted with two horizontal finger marks of yellow paint on both legs, thighs, forearms, upper arms, sides of the chest and stomach. On each cheek he has two vertical lines of red ochre.

On arrival at the hunting field, the hunt father makes the ritual fire. When the hunters assemble they ask the boy his new name and this is announced by the hunt father. The men thereupon call the boy by his new name. The boy is chosen to lead one of the two wings as the hunters move off. The first few rabbits that the boy kills he gives to his hunt father to pay for the two curved throwing sticks. Thereafter he gives some to the hunt father's relatives whenever he cares to do so. There is no prohibition against the boy's eating of the first rabbits he kills. The boy calls his hunt father “my hunt father” (i˙ma˙[unknown] na′'aD), and the father calls the boy “my hunt son” (i˙ma˙[unknown] Di′'i).

Though the hunting father teaches the boy hunting ritual and the arts of the skilled hunter, there is no formal instruction in the actual techniques of hunting large and small game. The boy is expected to learn of these things from old men telling hunting stories in the kiva during the winter months and from close observation of the behavior of other hunters when on his first hunting expeditions. The age at which a boy is initiated depends upon his own initiative, inclination, and luck. Today boys from about the age of twelve upwards go out regularly with the hunters if they can obtain the use of a horse or burro, and then it is only a matter of time before they acquire sufficient skill with a throwing stick to kill a jack rabbit they may chance to flush.

The curved throwing stick is thought to possess special virtue. According to a legend mentioned by Stephen, the Hawk deity ([unknown]i˙′'sa) owned the prototype of this stick, which was modelled after the shape of his wing. Long ago, when the Hopi had only the bow and arrow, a boy went to the Hawk deity and from him obtained the first stick. Its special virtue, and that of all sticks made after it, consisted in the fact that when stood up vertically with the grasping handle on the ground and its curve pointed towards a rabbit, the animal was magically drawn towards the stick and was thus easier to kill. Second Mesa informants did not recall the legend but vouched for the specific value of the stick. In spite of its legendary virtues, however, the hunter does not use the curved throwing stick exclusively. More often than not he tucks five or six straight, pointed throwing sticks into his belt before leaving the village, and throwing these with skill and accuracy, finds them as efficient as the curved stick. Moreover, they are easier to replace should any be lost or broken during the day's outing. The solitary hunter occasionally uses a rifle today for small game. The throwing stick, however, remains the favorite, and be it said the safer, weapon for those engaged in the large communal hunts. Rabbits are never choked to death for the reason that they would be too difficult to catch.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual247,Funeral,"Hopi Death Customs

DATA on death customs were obtained from two Mishongnovi informants, Sak'masa and Roy. Since death or anything connected with it is believed to be bad and of evil omen, most informants would not discuss the matter with us. Sometimes excuses were made, as in the case of Yusi'ima who refused to talk on the subject because the interpreter, his great-niece, a woman twenty-six years old, was too young to hear about bad subjects. At other times informants flatly and finally refused to talk, not even bothering to advance even the flimsiest excuse. Informants Roy and Sak'masa with great reluctance consented to talk only because they were our Hopi father and grandfather respectively, and dared not fail us. A brother, aged sixteen, precipitately bolted from the house when he learned the topic of conversation. Roy fortified himself with a long smoke and then asked with a painful mixture of resignation and stoicism, “Well, what do you want to know about this bad matter?”

The importance and nature of dreams as foretelling death are noted elsewhere. A sign of approaching death is swelling of the body: bystanders know death is near. There is no special behavior in the presence of a dying person, nor is any prayer made. Young people immediately leave the house, lest they become sick through fear and die themselves. “It takes a brave person to stay in the house of death,” and often most of the adults vanish as well. Whatever adult remains in the house attends the corpse. The paternal aunt in theory performs these duties at Shumopavi, Shipaulovi, and at First Mesa, but at Mishongnovi informants noted that any person prepares the corpse for burial. If the corpse is that of a man it is wrapped in a buckskin; if that of a woman, it is wrapped in her large or small wedding blanket, or in both. If no buckskin can be found for the man, then he, too, is wrapped in a woman's wedding blanket. Any clothes the deceased was wearing at the time of death are left on the body under the outer wrapping.

The body is not washed nor treated in any fashion. After covering the corpse, the man or woman in attendance immediately washes the deceased's hair with yucca suds and ties it up with yucca fiber. The corpse is fixed in a sitting position with flexed knees and arms and tied thus with yucca if necessary. It is bad to keep a corpse in the house. The father of the dead person, or, failing him, a man in the deceased's own clan, immediately makes prayer feathers. One feather is tied to the corpse's hair, one is placed under each foot “to take the body to the other world,” one is placed in each hand, and one over the navel “which is the place where the breath of a man lives.” No meal is sprinkled nor any prayer said at this time. The face of the corpse is covered with raw cotton, which signifies its future existence as a cloud. Wafer bread and a small gourd of water, lunch for the dead person on his journey, are placed in the pockets made by the flexion of the thighs against the body. The body is again wrapped in any blanket that the deceased used while alive. Any one of the men present picks up the corpse on his back and carries it to the cemetery (Goya'DGi', “place of ruins”). There is no prescribed manner for leaving the house. All men in the house at the time accompany the corpse to the graveyard.

The corpse is placed on the ground while the men dig a hole deep and wide enough to receive the flexed body. The corpse is placed in the hole in the sitting interment position, facing towards the west. The hole is rapidly filled in with sand and a stick of any sort is placed on the grave to serve as a ladder for the soul (breath) to depart westward.

Two incidents related by a Shipaulovi informant give the subjective background.

A man died in the afternoon when katsina were dancing in the village. People were upset, so the dance was finished early. At dusk they took the corpse down the mesa to Shipaulovi cemetery. The man's brother began to dig the grave, but when he got a little below the surface, he became so frightened that he stopped work and went home with all the other men, save one who bravely stayed to complete the burial.

Informant's aunt died during the winter of 1933 in the early evening. No one was present but her son: all the other relatives had mysteriously disappeared at the approach of death, some hiding, others recalling pressing reasons for going to Mishongnovi village. The son prepared the body for immediate burial, but since it was night-time he was too afraid to take the corpse down the mesa to the proper cemetery. He hastily wrapped it in an old quilt and carried it to the mesa edge from which he threw it down a deep fissure. The other relatives on their return next day felt sorry and censured the son, but none would make any attempt to retrieve the body that it might be properly buried in a grave.

While the men are away, the woman of the house boils juniper (η[unavailable]ïma'xBi') and strains the liquid into a bowl. The men return and wash themselves outside the house with this medicine water. Then all present go through the navo'h DZ i'ïya' rite to purify themselves and propitiate the spirit of the dead so that it will forget the living and not worry them. Members of the household sit in a circle on the floor of the house. In the center of the circle are placed a broken piece of pottery; on another broken piece of pottery a few grains of sand from an ant hill, brought back by the grave-diggers; a hair broom; a small piece of pounded yucca root; the sprigs of juniper previously boiled for the medicine liquid. Each person in turn picks up the hair broom with the left hand and with the broom-end brushes four times a few strands of hair from the top of his head over the broken pottery. Then he takes a pinch of yucca root, again with the left hand, and rubs it four times over the same few strands of hair, from distal to proximal end of the strands; similarly, with the left hand, he applies a section of juniper to his hair. Finally he picks up a few grains of the ant hill sand with his left hand and circles it, anti-clockwise, four times round his head. Each item is replaced in the center of the circle after use. After all have done this, the objects are thrown away outside the house. “This is how all in the house are protected against the spirits.”

On the following day, usually early in the morning, the man who made the prayer feathers takes a pottery bowl full of meal and five prayer sticks to the grave. The meal is to feed the spirit of the dead man, the prayer sticks to help it on its journey and to help it easily to become a cloud. At the grave “the man makes a prayer for rain and tells the spirit not to return to the village nor to take anyone else from the village with him on his journey.” To make doubly sure that the spirit does not return to the village, the man stops on his return home at the point where the trail up the mesa breaks onto the mesa ledge. Here he makes with charcoal four sets of four parallel lines. “This closes the trail so the spirit cannot get past.” When he arrives at the house all the members wash their hair. Piñon gum is put on hot coals and all smoke themselves and their clothes in this. Clothes of the deceased and small items of personal use are all thrown away. There is no further purification either for the house or its members; all do their best to forget the deceased. Ghosts of dead people are never seen, but it is bad luck to see the spirit of a dead person in a dream.

Children are not buried in the adult cemetery. It is not clear at what age a young person may be properly buried there, but it seems that until a girl obtains her naso'me hair dressing, or until a boy is initiated into a religious society, she or he is buried in the children's cemetery (DiBu's DïDï''ami'). Informants said that children were buried in the same manner as adults save that the four parallel marks on the trail would be made with the fingers only, not with charcoal.

A premature, still born, or unnamed infant that dies, is named, then buried in the children's cemetery or else placed in a rock fissure nearby. Prayer feathers are placed with the body, which is wrapped in a cradle quilt provided by the child's so˙''o', paternal aunt. Informants said that the propitiatory rituals to keep the spirit away from the village were performed, but it is likely they were confused about the matter, since in another context information clearly showed that the infant's spirit was believed to be conceived and reborn in another baby of the opposite sex. The mother of a dead infant stays within doors for twenty days whether it is her first or subsequent child. She is washed, etc., every fourth day until the twentieth day when the so˙′‘o’ comes to wash her head for the final time. Today the so˙′‘o’ brings to the mother a gift of gingham to take the place of the dead infant. This is a modern practice. Formerly no gift was made to the mother. The mother is taken outside to pray to the sun, though no prayer sticks are planted. The usual feast marks the end of the twenty-day seclusion with its attendant ritual fasting. Today some bereaved mothers do not stay indoors for twenty days. One woman who is said to have had ten or more still births or miscarriages in succession compromises on a ten-day seclusion.

Apart from showing variation in mortuary custom between First and Second Mesas, the above account shows that the Hopi are not without great fear of death. This fear permeates other social patterns. It is extremely difficult to obtain Hopi genealogies going beyond living generations; almost impossible to obtain the names of recently deceased forebears. “We don't like to talk of those dead. It makes us sad and frightened,” represents a general attitude. In another context, it may be recalled that a man acting for the first time as ma˙sau′' and having to make a midnight ceremonial circuit of graveyards and shrines, tried to commit suicide because fright and panic made him lose sense. The patterning of death ritual is in terms of Hopi master ideas. Everything must be reserved and ordered. It is from this point of view, but from this only, that Benedict's contrast between Pueblo and Navaho patterns has validity as far as the Hopi are concerned. When one penetrates below the pattern and studies the subjective attitudes of those concerned, it becomes at once evident that the Hopi are as much frightened and fearful of death and the dead person as the most classic Navaho. Hence the quick disposal of the corpse; hence the fear of the spirit; hence the protective, propitiatory, and purificatory rites when men return from the graveyard. Because of house construction and various historical and environmental factors, the Hopi cannot desert the house in which a corpse has lain. But it would seem that in regard to death psychology Hopi and Navaho are brothers, even though their cultural skins differ in characteristic coloring.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual248,Chief's Ritual Smoking for Fair Weather,"The Ritual Smoking of Chiefs

Two ceremonial meetings are held, reflecting the division of the year into two ritual segments. All the chiefs, both of clans and societies, meet in winter and summer to smoke for rain. The winter meeting is held at the house of the Snow Clan and the summer meeting at the house of the Cloud Clan. The smoking continues for as many days as required, that is, until rain comes. In case there has been too much rain, the chiefs smoke “for nice sunny days.” They meet every night after they come back from their fields. Smoking at a clan house is less rigidly formal than it must be at the kiva. Stools or chairs may be used and farm clothing is worn.

The first speaker, of the Bear Clan, is the Village Chief. Lomakema describes the scene:

“First, they pray on the cornmeal. They pray silently, holding the cornmeal to the four directions. Then they say:

‘Well, I am thinking for my side that I wish we have more rain this summer and have a better crop in our fields and let it rain all over our fields and when the first crop comes, let the children eat first and then we'll eat after them.

Let the grass grow and all the flowers and let the birds and butterflies have fun in the flowers and the rabbits and deer eat the grass and be happy. And the eagles eat the rabbits so when the time comes we'll get the eagles and pray with their feathers to all directions and have better seasons and rain and let us all have a long life.’”

Then the next headman speaks. “He starts right away, says the same thing, maybe a little bit different.” Lomayaktewa supplied a typical speech, more modern in its emphasis on livestock:

“Well, I think this is the way I'm thinking. Tomorrow when the morning comes up first, let there be a nice sunny day and let the gods then bring us good rains so that our crops could really grow and produce what they are supposed to so that our children will be the first to eat from the crops.

And may the grass be greener so that our livestock could eat and drink so that they be fat in order for us to have good meat. May there always be nice and rainy days forever and may all the people in this world of ours never be sick, be forever healthy.”

Each chief speaks for his own clan in the order of precedence determined by the origin legend, but he makes no specific reference to it, since everyone knows his authority and position. After all the clan and society chiefs have taken part, a relative of one or another of them may be asked to speak. As a nephew, perhaps, of a clan chief he may someday have to succeed his uncle. The first time he speaks he must compose a prayer following the general pattern. On the floor, the smokers' equipment is laid out: four pipes with reed stems, three of them in a yucca basket. A cloth and a buckskin bag hold the tobacco. To the left of the cloth bag is a fire-log (kopöchöva), made of shredded cedar bark and used for lighting the pipes.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual249,Naming Ritual,"On the twentieth day, on which the child receives its name, more elaborate ceremonies take place in the lying-in house. Early in the morning of that day the same attendant — the mother-in-law of the lying-in woman, or her substitute, proceeds to the house of the patient, bringing with her some soap-weed root and some water. The mother of the lying-in woman, or her substitute, has in the mean while built

FIG. 3. Washing the child on the twentieth day. a fire at one or several places in the house, and placed some water and the food to be used for breakfast thereon. The mother-in-law then prepares some suds of the yucca roots which she has brought. In these suds she washes the two ears of corn, which are usually white. Hereupon she washes the head of the lying-in woman, then her own; the mother's mother then follows, and then the head and body of the child is washed by the father's mother. See Fig. 3. Sometimes the father and others also wash their own heads. After she has bathed the child, she holds it in her left arm, rubs a little meal on its forehead, cheeks, chin, and into its mouth, and then taking the two corn ears in her right hand she holds them on the breast of the child. See Fig. 4. While she does this she says: “To old age your life being preserved, may you become an old man (old woman), but N. N. you shall be named.” (Woyómii uh kátci návokawintakang wúhtakwuwani (wúhtihaskiwuwani) níkang N. N. yan um máchiwni.)

Other women have in the mean while come in, each one bringing with her a little water with which she also bathes the child's head and body, giving it a name in the same manner as the grandmother. The child thus receives as many as five, eight, ten, or even more names, only one of which usually “sticks” (húrzhti), as the Hopi say. Each new name is greeted by the mother with “Thanks!” (áskwali!) These-women all belong to the same clan as the mother and child. Some leave as soon as they are through, others remain. Sometimes the mother washes her feet, body, and arms while the child is being bathed. A branch of juniper is placed in the water, and usually also a hot stone. On one occasion the mother stood over the bowl containing the branch and stone, thus receiving, as it were, a steam-bath. On another occasion the stone and wet juniper twig were placed on the floor, and while the mother held her feet over them — first the one and then the other — they were washed by one of the aunts. In fact, this performance varies in small details on different occasions.

The water used for these baths is always tepid, and the wrappings of the child are warmed at the fire while it is subjected to a new bath.

FIG. 4. Holding the ears of corn to the breast of the child, and giving it its first name. It often happens that when the little one has just gone to sleep in his warm coverings, a new aunt arrives, and it is taken out of its wrappings and subjected to a new bath and a new name, which may be repeated in a few minutes. When all the aunts have done their duty as described, the last of the four lines on the four walls of the room are scraped off either by the grandmother or by one of the aunts of the child. The meal, together with the water in which the mother has bathed herself, some sand on which the bowl had been placed to absorb any water that might be spilled, etc., is taken by one of the relatives to the place outside of the village on which the placenta, sand, tray, etc., were placed on the first day, as has already been recorded. On one occasion I noticed that a vessel containing some urine of the mother was also taken along, and I am told that this is done every day. The godmother and the mother of the child leave the house and go to the edge of the mesa east of the village, the godmother carrying the child, the two ears of corn, and both some sacred meal. In the case of a primapara, the young mother puts on her bridal moccasins and the larger of her two white bridal robes for this solemn occasion. Sometimes the mother carries the two ears of corn. At the edge of the mesa they turn their faces towards the rising sun. The grandmother, holding the child in her left arm, touches its breast with the two corn ears, and then waves them towards the rising sun. See Fig. 5. Turning to the child she again says the little prayer, but now inserts all the names it has received. Hereupon she hands the child to the mother, who repeats the same performance. Both then hold their hands containing the meal to their lips, breathe a prayer over it, sprinkle it towards the rising sun, kiss the child, and then return to the house. Here the morning meal is now prepared and partaken of. First, those who have bathed the child and the members of the house eat. Then the grandmother on the mother's side goes through the houses and invites any one to come and share with them the morning meal. Sometimes it

FIG. 5. Mother of the child waving the ears of corn to the rising sun. is even announced by the crier. Any food may from now be eaten by the mother, and a little meat and salty food are even given to the baby. The cover that carefully kept out the sunshine during the twenty days is not put up on this day, and everything in the house assumes normal conditions again.

The child is then rubbed all over the body with a mixture of tallow and c[unknown]ta (a red ochre). This is later on repeated every few days for about a month, to clean the child's skin, the women say. On the fifth and tenth days after these rites, the woman once more washes the child's and her own head, but hers with cold water. In the case of a primapara this is done on the tenth and twentieth days. During these respective periods they are also supposed to observe the strictest continence.

While the manner of procedure during these ceremonies is essentially the same in the different families, it naturally varies in small details; for instance, where the grandmothers are no longer living, one of her relatives takes her place, or sometimes the mother washes her own head, sometimes it is done by her mother-in-law. Some details are also determined by the condition of the patient; but the rites are described as nearly as possible as they should be, and as they are performed under normal circumstances.

A Special Name-Giving Ceremony in Oraibi

The foregoing account of the natal ceremonies is a compilation of notes and observations made at different times. Since the compilation was made, another name-giving ceremony was observed, and it was thought best to print the notes on that observation as they were made, instead of incorporating them in the foregoing general account. An opportunity is thus afforded to notice and study the successive stages of the rites in a particular ceremony, to note small variations, etc.

We came to the house where the ceremony was to take place at about four o'clock, and found the people still asleep. In about ten minutes the grandmother came in bringing with her a kettle of water and two white ears of corn. She soon commenced to make suds of yucca roots. She is the mother of the father of the baby and her name is Nuvayonsi. A few minutes later came in Qömáhepnöma, the sister of the former. Both belong to the Coyote clan.

As soon as the suds was ready the grandmother bathed the two corn-ears, rinsing them off with fresh water. Some water had, in the mean while, been heated, to which the grandmother added some suds. A good fire was by this time burning in an American stove. Another fire had been started in the fireplace in an adjoining room where a large vessel of water was boiling. A third fire was burning in the corner of the room where the ceremony took place. On this latter, the water for the ceremony was being heated.

After having bathed the two ears of corn, the grandmother washed the mother's head, which was repeated by Qöma. When both were through they poured some water over her head, rinsing it. The mother herself pressed the water from her hair. The bowl, containing the suds, was then placed near the stove, some fresh water being poured into another bowl; and in this water the arms and the shoulders of the mother were bathed. The water in the little pail, which was used for these purposes, had been heated, with a few sprigs of juniper in it. After the arms and the upper part of the body of the mother had been bathed, a little sand, which had been lying in the corner, was swept forward, a heated stone placed on it, and some yucca roots that had been used for the suds, as well as some of the juniper leaves, were placed on the stone. The mother then placed her right foot on these branches, and the grandmother washed it. The same was repeated with the left foot. The mother then got a tray on which the grandmother placed the sand, juniper branches, and yucca leaves, sweeping everything up very thoroughly. The heated stone was also placed on this tray. Hereupon the grandmother took the same broom and swept the fourth corn-meal line, which still remained upon the wall, into her left hand, throwing the corn-meal also into the tray. The meal on a joist was then scraped off. A live ember from the fireplace in the corner was finally placed on the tray, then Q[unknown]ma took the tray in her left arm, and the little pail of water, containing some more juniper sprigs, in her right hand, and carried these things to a “placenta pile” outside of the village. This pile is about one hundred yards north of the house. On this she threw the tray with its contents, pouring also the water on it. The little tin-pail she brought back with her. Upon her return to the house the bowl with the suds was again brought forward, the baby taken out, and its head bathed by the grandmother. The child was entirely nude, and did not cry at all. After the grandmother was through bathing the child's head, Q[unknown]ma took it and also washed its head. They held the child in their left hand, back downward. The suds was then poured into another bowl, and fresh water poured into this bowl, with which the head of the child was rinsed. The water was again poured into the other bowl, and fresh water taken, and the face of the child received another washing. Hereupon the little one was placed into the bowl, and the entire body bathed by Q[unknown]ma. She then handed it to the grandmother, who wrapped it up in a blanket, which the mother had in the mean while warmed by the fire. The child at once went to sleep. See Fig. 6.

FIG. 6. The baby sleeping during an interval between two baths.

A third woman came in, who was the sister of the father of the child. She also bathed the child's entire body, the child by this time having something to say about the matter.

The three women who had come in by this time belonged to the Coyote clan, the clan of the father.

When the third woman was through, the child was again wrapped up in the blanket and held by the grandmother, who rubbed its face and body with corn-meal. The step-sister of the baby carried out the water. The child was here nursed by the mother. Another woman came in with a little water and also bathed the child. The mother, in the mean while, warmed a blanket, in which the child was placed again as soon as it was bathed, whereupon the mother re-assumed the nursing of the child. No one else coming in, the grandmother took the child in her left arm, picked up the two corn-ears with her right hand, waved them forward over the chest of the child, expressed the usual good wish, and gave the child a name. The same thing was repeated by the other three women in the sequence in which they happened to be sitting.

The first name given the child was “Little-Fox” (Sikáhtayhoya); the second, “Gray-In-a-Line” (Qöyáwishtiwa); the third, “Beautiful-Brought” (Lomámakiwa), referring to a pretty fox skin which is imagined to have been brought by some one; the fourth, “Remembered” ([unavailable]una), referring to the fact that the Coyote sometimes happens to think about some food that he has run across, or buried somewhere; the fifth, “Waving [Fire]” (Yoshámna), referring to the belief of the Hopis that the “Skeleton” goes round during the night, occasionally swinging or waving a spark of fire. The reason why this name refers to the Skeleton clan, though the name-giver properly belongs to the Coyote clan, is that these clans are related to each other. Another interval took place, in which the grandmother held the child, calling it by the name she had given it, and playing with it. By and by a sixth woman, an old grandmother, came in. She is probably the oldest of the Coyote clan, and the members of that clan call her their Cóa (old woman, ancestor, etc.). She gave it the name of “Juniper-Nodule” (Hóplö, from hópölo), referring probably to the berries, but sometimes also to nodules growing over places where branches or twigs have broken off. Finally a seventh woman bathed it, and gave it the name Homíhepnöma. She handed the child to the grandmother again, who rubbed its face with a little corn-meal, which, by the way, she did after each bathing.

By this time all the women, except the grandmother, left.

The step-sister of the little baby was grinding a handful of corn-meal, which she brought in and placed in a bowl, from which the grandmother had been using corn-meal.

At a quarter to six the mother and grandmother got ready for the morning offering to the sun. The grandmother already had the child on her back, and was ready to start, when another woman came in to bathe the child. She complained that she had not gotten awake in time. So the child was taken out of its wrappings and received an eighth bath. This woman was Lomanan-Kwusha's wife. She gave the child the name of “Well-Caught” (Lomávikta), referring to chasing and capturing a fox. The grandmother and the mother then again made ready for the morning offering, the grandmother taking the child on her back, the mother the two corn-ears, and both a little pinch of corn-meal.

FIG. 7. Offering sacred meal to the rising sun.

FIG. 8. Grandmother carrying home food. They proceeded to the edge of the mesa, southeast of the village, where the main trail leaves the mesa. Here the mother took the blanket from the grandmother's back, and assisted the latter in taking the child in her arms. Holding the child in her right arm, the grandmother breathed a silent prayer on the meal which she held in her right hand. See Fig. 7. Rubbing a small quantity of it on and between the lips of the baby, she threw the rest towards the rising sun. She then sucked the meal from the child's lips, and spurted it towards the east, which she did four times in all. Hereupon she took the two ears of corn from the mother, extended them towards the east, and with a circular motion towards the left brought them to the baby's chest. This she did four times also. As she went through this performance, she repeated the different names which the child had received. Finally, she expressed a good wish for the child, whereupon she placed the baby on her back again, the mother taking the corn-ears, and both returned to the house. The mother, it seems, dispensed with going through the same rites, as is usually done on these occasions.

While they attended to this performance, the father of the child prepared some suds, whereupon he also washed his head. A sumptuous morning meal followed, in which a number of the relatives of the family participated.

After this morning meal the grandmother is usually given a considerable quantity of food, principally píki, which she wraps up in a blanket and takes home with her. See Fig. 8.",0,0,7777,0,0,0
Ritual250,The Momtcit Ceremony,"Until the cessation of Indian warfare, the Momtcit ceremony was celebrated annually in the Wiklavi kiva of Oraibi, in the fall of the year, not long after the close of the women's Marau ritual which generally occurred in September. The membership was very large as it was open to men of any age or clan (some youngsters joining even before their Katcina initiations), and it was considered advisable for every normal male in the village to enroll. The members were divided into two groups, the regular Momtcit and the Nakyawimi, or Stick-swallowers society. The ritual paraphernalia of both divisions were owned by the Spider and Kokop clans, and the Nakyawimi had no permanent leader, being led each year by an officer selected by the Momtcit chief. The two units met jointly in the same kiva, but the Nakyawimkyam (Stick-swallower society members) used the main lower floor, and the Mutcwimi (Momtcit society) occupied the raised section south of the ladder. If any one of the Momtcit men stepped down during the progress of the ceremony, except for a formal smoke or on other “official” business, he could be forced to join the stick-swallowers.

The observances opened in customary fashion with a smoke by the officers and the manufacture of prayer-objects, but there was no public announcement of the ceremony's start, and the participants were told by word of mouth when it was time for them to assemble at Wiklavi. Once begun, the rites lasted for two days, the first of which was devoted largely to the setting out of an altar and the making of medicine. The Kokop head officer played the part of Pukonghöya, and the Spider chief impersonated the Spider Woman. These deities, as well as the younger War Twin, Palungahöya, and Masau'u, were also present in effigy on the altars; and in addition, six beasts who represented the four cardinal points plus zenith and nadir were made the recipients of special prayers while the medicine was being mixed. In the ritual order in which they were named, these animals were Mountain Lion for the north, Bear for the west, Wildcat for south, Wolf for east, Kwatoko (Vulture?) for above, and Snake for below. Other gods who were prominent in this cult were Sotukinangwu'u, the main sky deity, who was represented either by a star, a cross or a lightning frame; the Sun; and the Milky Way (Songwuka).

The preparation of the war medicine began early in the afternoon of the first day, with the Pukonghöya impersonator playing the main part. He began by inserting an arrowhead into a plaque filled with water, holding it in place as he sang the required songs. Then he added a pinch of flesh scraped from an enemy scalp, and bits of “hard rock.” As he bent close over the bowl, Pukonghöya shouted loudly from time to time to notify the powerful beasts who “owned” the medicine of the proceedings. Whenever he shouted the assemblage would utter a war-cry. When it was finished, a little of the medicine was drunk by all present, and the rest was mixed with gray clay and rubbed on arms, legs, heart, and back. Initiated members were permitted to apply some of the medicine to outsiders in order to make them healthy and brave.

When this rite had been concluded, the members of both groups prepared to hold a “practice” dance outside their kiva. The Momtcit men wore conventional dance kilts and sashes, hanks of blue yarn fastened below the knees and across the body as bandoleers, fringed moccasins of red buckskin, and plume clusters ( hurunkwa) containing four-inch reeds with eagle breath feathers affixed, which were tied to the hair. The body was daubed with yellow, in the manner of the Wuwutcim men at some of their public appearances; and the face was painted with two short parallel marks called Pukongkuku (Elder War Twin's footsteps), which are warrior symbols. They were drawn vertically on each cheek, first with red ochre ( suta) and then overlaid with specular iron ( yalaha). Fox pelts tucked into the sashes at the small of the back completed the costume. No masks or leg rattles were worn.

The Nakyawimkyam were similarly dressed, except that their bodies were painted more in the manner of the Powamu Katcinas in the Bean dance. One leg was smeared with yellow and the other with red; one arm was yellow and the other blue; a red line was run down the middle of the chest; and a curved yellow line was run around one nipple and a similar blue line around the other. A soft eagle feather was fastened to the hair in such fashion that it hung down over the forehead, and warrior markings were made on the cheeks.

When all was in readiness, the Momtcit men would emerge first, singing in a low tone as they came out and chanting louder as they formed a half circle at the west side of their kiva. They joined hands with the fingers imbricated, and at some stages they rocked forward and back, resting on one foot at a time somewhat as do the Antelope members during the Snake dance; and at other times they moved sideways in a sinistral circuit. Soon there would come from the kiva a Nakyawimkya, carrying in his right hand a cedar stick which he had prepared that morning, and accompanied by the Pukonghöya actor who carried a vessel of recently prepared medicine water. Before stepping down from the kiva hatch both men sprinkled meal to the sun; then the Pukonghöya led the way within the arc formed by the Momtcit group, the Nakya performer dancing after him with a high-stepping, prancing motion. Together they moved in a counter-clockwise circle within the larger Momtcit ring; then they reversed their direction. As soon as their man[unavailable]uvres had brought them into a position facing north, the Nakya man moistened his stick either with saliva or medicine and “swallowed” it, his companion asperging him until the stick was removed. Again the couple danced as before, and as they faced west, south, and east, successively, the Nakyawimkya “swallowed” his stick repeatedly. Throughout the proceedings the Momtcit society men continued to dance and sing. When the exhibition was over the swallower waved his stick in a discharming motion in all directions, to prevent spectators from being stricken with sore throats. He and Pukonghöya would then return to the kiva, and soon after their departure the Momtcit circle would begin to unwind, one man entering the kiva at a time while the rest continued to sing until their turns came. The order of entry was so arranged that the latest initiates were the last to reach the hatchway. Thus ended the public spectacle, for the rest of the first day's ritual was esoteric.

On his return to the kiva the Nakya soloist put his stick down north of the fireplace, and without removing his paint or costume, smoked a pipe of native tobacco over it. Then he made a nakwakwosi and a paho, and deposited these with his stick at the Buffalo shrine. When he had returned and undressed, the Momtcit men likewise washed up and changed to everyday clothes.

That night the members of both groups remained awake, the Nakyawimkyam occupying the main floor and the Momtcit using the raised level. They smoked, checked their paraphernalia, sang songs, and practiced their performances independently until the Pleiades were overhead. At this time the two units combined for a repetition of the altar ritual and the manufacture of another supply of war medicine. Long before dawn the two divisions began to paint and dress in order to be ready to start at sunrise, and this time the entire Nakya membership prepared to take part. They decorated themselves in the same manner as yesterday's solitary performer, except that the parallel cheek marks and the oblique lines which meet on the bridge of the nose were smeared on with a white wash.

The second day's performance was conducted along virtually identical lines with those of the preceding day, except that the stick to be swallowed was a lightning stick (fig. 6a), and the men succeeded each other in the swallowing exhibitions until all the Nakyawimkyam had performed. As a sequel to the first round of performances the stick-swallowers would appear in public for a second time, using an implement known as an eagle stick (fig. 6b). Prior to their second appearance they daubed specular iron over the white warrior markings which they had worn before. Again all the society members performed, succeeding one another at fixed intervals; but for a grand finale the entire membership appeared in a body, each man carrying a lightning stick in one hand and an eagle rod in the other. These they “swallowed” in unison, using first one stick and then the other as they faced the four cardinal directions in the customary rotation. After this display the Nakya society men returned to the kiva, to be followed in a few moments by the Momtcit. During the night, all the sticks that had been used in the ceremony were deposited secretly at the Spider Woman's shrine.",1,1,1,0,1,1
Ritual251,,-, ,,,,,
Ritual252,Kúivato,"At about five o'clock, when all are up, a little ceremony takes place, called “kúivato.” The women take their corn-ear “mothers” and a pinch of sacred meal and proceed to a rock south-east of but close to the village, the chief priestess leading the column. Here they form in a line, facing the east. They hold the sacred meal to their lips, whisper a prayer on it, and then throw it towards the east, where the qöyángw[unknown]n[unknown]pt[unknown] (white-rising or dawn), or sometimes the si[unknown]ángw[unknown]n[unknown]pt[unknown] (yellow-rising or dawn) may be seen illumining the sky. The novices also deposit one of the four nakwákwosis which they received with the head scratcher the previous day. All then silently return—Ng[unknown]si again heading the line—to the kíva, where they replace their corn-ears on the floor near the altar. This rite of kúivato takes place in all Hópi kíva ceremonies, so far as I know, though varying somewhat in form. The name signifies “(I) go to see” (or “to look,” “to behold”). Just why this performance is so termed nobody has thus far been able to tell me. But as the ceremonial performances in the kíva are, as a rule, not supposed to begin before the appearance of the morning dawn, the dawn is often spoken of and watched in the kíva. Not infrequently some one will be told: “Um aokúivato” (“Go and see, look”)! Whereupon one thus instructed will ascend the ladder to see whether it is already dawning. While this is, of course, entirely informal, the little rite described above might be taken as a formal ceremonial, going to behold or to see whether the morning dawn has appeared. In this rite all are supposed to participate. With it is connected a little prayer-offering to the precursor of the sun, the dawn, and also to the sun itself. The men usually perform this rite closer to the kíva. When I asked one of them what they prayed, he said they usually uttered a short prayer to the dawn and to the sun, saying: “Táwa ínaa, ókiw yókwani púu ítam híkwyani” (“Sun, my father! oh (make it) rain, and we shall drink”). I have noticed several times that women who happened to be absent when the others performed the rite of kúivato afterwards performed it alone, but close to the kíva.",1,0,7777,0,0,0
Ritual253,Nia Ikar,"Nia Ikar ('The Way of the Demon') and Demon Attack

According to Holmer & Wassén (1958), Nia Ikar (‘The Way of the Demon’) is a chant used by the Kuna to cure insanity. There are several difficulties with this statement. First, the Kuna have no terms which label conditions which might be translated as “insanity;” and second, while the chant is often used to cure patients suffering from what are clearly severe psychological disorders, it may also be employed to alleviate a variety of other ailments, including dizziness, fainting spells, loss of appetite, bad dreams, and even skin disease. It is best said that ‘The Way of the Demon’ is performed to expell and destroy demons which have taken control of a person’s purpa, corrupting it in any one of a number of different ways. However, demon attack is usually a very serious matter, for this particular spirit is one of the most virulent and dangerous inhabitants of the Kuna cosmos.

Demons are not associated with any particular animal or natural force, and they have the ability to transform themselves into all manner of shapes and guises. They usually appear in humanoid form; frequently they are grotesque, and they occasionally appear as Blacks. In the mythological accounts, demons are often pictured as fantastic quasi-human creatures with eyes in the back of their heads and bodies covered with black bumps, coarse hair, or lights that flash on an off. They are considered to be the ‘chiefs’ or ‘kings’ of lesser ponikana, and are sometimes seen journeying about the cosmos mounted on the backs of huge crocodiles, tapirs, or jaguars. But demons are not always possessed of such terrifying shapes. When they are bent on deception they often take the aspect of harmless Kuna men or women. They have a penchant for taking on the form of a friend or close relative, or even an alluring stranger, for the purpose of coaxing their unsuspecting human victims into traps. For example, in the chant published by Holmer & Wassén (Ibid.), a demon disguises itself as an attractive young woman who seduces her victim with feminine charm. While monstrous demons strike terror in the hearts of solitary Kuna wandering in lonely places, demons disguised as innocuous humans are even more threatening, for their attacks are devious and therefore more difficult to guard against.

Demons often trick people into committing anti-social or self-destructive acts. For example, during the past twenty years there have been at least six cases of suicide in Ustuppu and Okop Sukkun, and all of the victims were persuaded by demons to take their lives. All were males; two hanged themselves and four ended their lives with shotgun blasts. One was an older man who had been bitten by a snake several months previous. Although he was given traditional treatment, the snake poni was not successfully purged from his purpa. The corruption of his purpa became increasingly severe and the damage was mirrored in his body by progressive infection that eventually rotted the flesh to expose the bones of his leg. He became despondent, and one night when the rest of this family was attending a puberty ceremony he was visited by a demon who confused his thinking and convinced him to hang himself from a roofbeam.

People with irascible personalities are often victims of demon attack. Their anti-social behavior is attributed to defects in their spiritual makeup (which are in turn due to contamination by ponikana), and they are more susceptible to domination by demons. When people of this sort die, especially in some unnatural way (e.g., being struck by lightning, drowning, etc.), it is believed that they may return to the world of humans as demons themselves.

This occurred several years ago in Ustuppu when an elderly woman noted for stinginess and kleptomania died during an operation at the Ailikanti hospital. One of the woman’s cousins had given blood for a transfusion, and later became infected by the same demon who had taken over the old woman’s spirit. Shortly thereafter, the cousin came face-to-face with the dead woman’s decayed demon purpa as she walked alone in the dark outside her house. One month later, the demon spirit appeared in the cooking house and bit her on the leg, causing intense pain and, eventually, fainting spells, loss of strength, and dizziness. In similar fashion, a man from Okop Sukkun who had reputedly been kiatakkalet died in 1975 when a demon pushed a stick through one of his nostrils into his brain. Within a month after his death, his purpa, which had been converted into a demon, started to appear in people’s dreams, threatening all manner of violent action. And when a sleeping man’s cheek was mysteriously sliced open, this demon was held responsible.

Persons victimized by demons often become emotionally deranged. They hold conversations with demons (which are invisible to everyone else), run about erratically, take off their clothes, froth at the mouth, try to jump in the ocean and drown themselves, bang their heads against house posts, quarrel with others, and occasionally attempt bodily harm to those around them. The purpa of these people has been dominated and ‘transformed’ by demons, and they have lost control over their behavior. Obviously, this condition is dangerous not only to the victims but also to the community at large. Demons frequently impart abnormal strength to those whom they possess, directing them to kill other people or cause general havoc in the village. Because of the dangers involved in such cases, strong pressure comes from the community to perform ‘The Way of the Demon,’ a ceremony which combines a powerful chant with the administration of toxic medicines.

During the performance of the chant, the walls of the patient’s house are covered with leaves and strips of cloth to obstruct prying eyes, and crosses made of nipar palm stalks are placed around the walls of the house and piled in heaps on the floor to keep the demons away. In the cases I have observed, there were no children present and a deathly silence hung over the proceedings. The only sound was the monotonous incantation of the ‘demon’ chanter, who rested in a hammock strung beside that of the patient. The women characteristically paint their cheeks with a brilliant coat of achiote paste to frighten the demons away. Achiote paintings of humanoid figures with spikes instead of limbs adorn the doors and houseposts; and a white flag decorated with the same figures is often flown from the roof top to scare the demons and to warn passersby from venturing too near. Inside the house, and occasionally outside on the street, spanish peppers, termite nest, barbasco, and other foul-smelling plants and materials are burned to ‘confuse the road’ the demons have opened to the victim. The core of the ceremony is ‘The Way of the Demon’ chant ( Nia Ikar), which generally lasts between three and five hours.

In the version published by Holmer & Wassén (1958), there is a description of a demon that transforms itself into a seductive young woman and leaves her mountain domain to capture the purpa of a man she has selected to be her likely victim. She puts on fetching Kuna clothes, paints her face with achiote, and sets off through the trees and along the river toward the Kuna village. She crosses the river, cuts through a banana plantation and then a coconut grove, finally making her way across the ocean to the island where the man lives. As she waits on the shore near a fleet of beached canoes, the man comes out of his house and she approaches him. ‘Do you have a wife?’ she asks him. He says yes, and she continues: ‘I see that you do not like your wife. Since you do not like your wife, we will get married.’ She then moves forward and places a magical hat on his head, transforming his vision. His eyes become bright, ‘like lightning bugs,’ and he sees the spiritual world of the demons stretching out before him. A road opens to the domain of the demons, and the man’s behavior is suddenly altered: ‘the man is yelling “yoo;” the man is yelling “wii;” he man is yelling “suk;” the man is roaring with laughter; he is acting like a demon.’

But the shaman helpers of the chanter, led by Shaman Balsawood, have previously been deployed about the area, and now swing into action. As the demon woman climbs into the man’s hammock, making him laugh, Shaman Balsawood exhorts his helpers to grab her with nets, vines, and hooks. The net ropes make noises like cicadas, bells, and fire beetles, and the demon woman cries out ‘What is happening to me?’ Her body is quivering and her heart is pounding, but after a short struggle she is thrown to the ground and bound tight. Shaman Balsawood counsels his men, telling them to work well, to keep their courage. The demon woman is wrapped in nets and tied fast with vines and iron chains. She screams like cicadas, her lips are twisted, her nose is like a gourd.

Shaman Balsawood confronts her: ‘Are you trying to look like an Indian woman? You have opened a road to my man, you have placed a hat on his head.’ Then he informs her that she will be taken to a deep whirlpool and roasted. She tries to change his mind by saying that she will become someone who ‘washes your shirt, your golden coat;’ but he replies: ‘How are you going to wash my shirt and my golden coat; you are not a woman, I see.’

The shaman spirits then leave the demon woman to visit Kilu Kwetuli, notorious ‘king’ of the demon spirits, to borrow a canoe to transport the demon woman to the whirlpool. Kilu Kwetuli greets the shamans: ‘Shaman friends, what brings you here?’ Shaman Balsawood replies: ‘Kilu (‘Uncle’), I come to visit you. I want one of your canoes. The demons have opened a road to my man, I see. In order to roast the demons I want your canoe.’ Then he adds ‘If you don’t turn a canoe over to me, I will dry up your whirlpools. Here are shamans that can dry up your whirlpools, I come to tell you. If you don’t run a canoe over to me I will send your golden stools down to the eighth level.’ ‘Friend shaman,’ answers Kilu, ‘I hear you well. I know that you have tied up all the demons... I will find a large canoe for you.’

The shamans return with the canoe, which is a crocodile, and lift the entangled demon woman inside. They set out for the whirlpool of Kilu Kwetuli again; their paddles turn over the sea water, make it foam, rise up, shine, form funnels. They raise their sails and the canoe shoots forward at greater speed. They pass by the ‘glistening deep whirlpool,’ the ‘swampy deep whirlpool,’ the ‘small deep whirlpool,’ the ‘dry deep whirlpool,’ the ‘deep whirlpool that moves back and forth.’ They see pelicans of all colors, crabs, and turtles laying eggs on the sandy beach. Finally, they reach Kilu’s domain. Shaman Balsawood tells his helpers to gather together different types of firewood, and they construct a pyre. They ignite it and lift the demon woman into the flames. She is twisting, fainting, her hair is abundant. Her body crackles and seethes, her clothes and hair shine like fire, and before long she is converted to ashes. Kilu, who has watched the entire scene, says to the shamans: ‘Shaman friends, when do you think you will visit my domain again?’ Shaman Balsawood replies: ‘If the demons happen to open a road to my man, I will come to visit your domain again, I believe.’ And with this warning, they return to the house of the sick man. As they approach the village, they hear their chanter singing in the patient’s house... and the chant comes to a close.

‘The Way of the Demon’ is usually repeated at least four times over the same number of days to ensure maxium effect; if it fails to bring about the desired cure, a different chanter may be brought in to continue, altering his strategy if a nele finds that the initial diagnosis has been faulty. As mentioned before, the purpose of the chant is to rid the area of the menacing demons and seal off the victim from further attacks. In this regard, the chant text in Holmer & Wassén’s book is incomplete. While it describes disposing of the demon woman who possess the patient’s purpa, it lacks the crucial section in which the shaman helpers post themselves about the house and guard against the incursion of other demons.

Another important facet of treatment for demon possession, carried out concurrently with the chant, involves the administration of highly toxic medicines designed to clean the patient’s purpa of demon contamination. One of the ingredients in this mixture is a poisonous root called ‘worm medicine’ ( ina nusu); others are barbasco, which is also used as fish poison, and certain substances employed in another context to induce abortion. The medicine -- a murky brown liquid -- is forced down the patient’s throat. The initial doses are carefully calculated to cause unconsciousness. As soon as the patient passes out, he is carried to a medicine canoe and bathed in water steeped in sweet-smelling plants such as pisep (sweet basil), kokke, nopar, and achueryala, which soothe the purpa of the patient and revive him. This treatment continues for several days, until the last vestiges of demon pollution are purged from the purpa. If the patient remains in the grasp of the demon spirits, larger and larger doses are given until he is either cured or killed. When a case is seen as incurable, the inevitable end is death.

At least in part because Panamanian law frowns on such drastic measures, Kuna curing specialists now occasionally send their more difficult cases to the hospital in Ailikanti, where they are treated with drugs such as Thorazine. Although this is not yet an entirely accepted practice among the Kuna, it occurred in 1974 with a teenage girl from Ustuppu. She had recently come to live with her parents in San Blas after having spent virtually all of her life in Panama City. She spoke only a few words of Kuna, felt very much out of place, and within the course of a few months suffered a nervous breakdown. Her family was preparing the traditional treatment for her when several Catholic missionaries intervened. Knowing the culture well, they argued that Kuna medicine would do her go good because she had most surely been stricken by a Panamanian demon while living in the capital. Reasoning that only Panamanian medicine would be able to overcome Panamanian demons, the missionaries succeeded in having her taken to the Ailikanti hospital.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual254,"Conversing, Apsoket","Conversing' (Apsoket)

The longest and most complex of all Kuna curing ceremonies is called Apsoket (‘Conversing’), or Nek Apsoket (‘Conversing with the Place’). It involves the entire community in one way or another and spans eight intensive days, together with several more after the major part of the ritual has been completed. The most common purpose of the ceremony is to rid the village of ponikana which have either been threatening or ravaging the populace with disease on an epidemic scale. At times, however, Apsoket is performed as a precautionary measure. For example, when the community is anxious to utilize a virgin stretch of land known to be controlled by dangerous ponikana to open up a plantation or carry out a construction project, Apsoket will be undertaken to contain the spirits, and ‘calm the place down.’ According to traditional history, the first Kuna to inhabit the region around Ustuppu pacified the spirit-infested whirlpools along the coast in this manner.

The following incidents are just a few examples of the kinds of adverse circumstances that have motivated the performance of Apsoket ceremonies over the past several decades in Ustuppu:

1. A group of men journeyed to the far tip of Kwituppu (‘Mosquito Island’), seaward of Ustuppu, and chopped down some trees belonging to a colony of jaguar ponikana. These spirits became angered and retaliated by abducting the purpakana of a number of people on Ustuppu.

2. Along the coastline, just east of the mouth of the Putturkanti (River), lies a mangrove swamp teeming with crocodiles. Several years ago, some men from Ustuppu went there to hunt them for their skins, which they sold in Panama. When they caught a crocodile with two tails, they knew something was amiss. Sure enough, shortly thereafter the crocodile ponikana began attacking the village and carrying off purpakana.

3. Some men walked inland behind Sukkun Yaa (a large bay filled with mangroves about an hour east of Ustuppu) and chopped down a large tree ( pinnuwala) to make a canoe. They were evidently not aware that a band of niakana had strung their clothes lines across the branches of the tree. When the lines were disturbed, the niakana became furious and swept through Ustuppu with an epidemic of skin disease.

4. The Ustuppu villagers wanted to clear a swampy stretch of land at the far end of Sukkun Yaa to establish a community coconut farm. It was well known that this spot contained a spirit whirlpool called Tapnati Pirya, which was inhabited by numerous ponikana: elephants, crocodiles, sharks, water jaguars, swamp birds, and the like. Before moving forward with their plans they had to contain these spirits.

The Apsoket ceremony is sometimes undertaken on the heels of a series of disquieting portents: sparks are seen falling out of clouds, or animals with anomalous behavior are spotted (e.g., groups of sharks are seen cruising near the island or birds begin their migration at the “wrong” time of year). If a man noted for anti-social behavior has recently died his purpa may be converted into poni and begin to appear to members of the community, making threats of havoc or causing injury. The spirits of people who have died in “freak” accidents, who have taken their own lives, or who have been murdered are also often transformed into ponikana whch menance the community. At such times, the Kuna say that ‘the place is heating up’ or ‘the place is angry.’ To banish these spirits from the region and bring things back to normal, the Kuna characteristically prescribe the Apsoket ceremony.

Once villagers have decided to perform Apsoket, plans are made to gather the medicines to be used during the eight-day ritual. As there may be as many as 80 different types of medicines involved, some of which are only found far inland in the Bayano region or east along the coast across the Colombian border, the collection often takes several months. Medical specialists with a thorough knowledge of botany, together with the men who have unleashed the ponikana through their reckless actions (if this has taken place), are sent to round up the necessary materials.

While this is being done, 50 tall figures, each about five or six feet in height, are carved from balsawood trunks. The spirits of these figures are to be the leaders in the campaign against the ponikana who are threatening the village, and they in turn are given a chief, who is also made of balsawood, yet is somewhat taller than the rest. These figures are usually carved to look like human beings, although some are occasionally rendered in the image of eagles, jaguars, crocodiles, and other dangerous animals. The chief of the balsawood ‘shamans,’ as they are called, is carefully selected: a number of years ago, for instance, an American visitor to the village of Ailikanti saw a seven foot-tall figure for Apsoket made in the likeness of General Douglas McArthur, who was apparently considered by the Kuna to be the most worthy personage for the ceremony. According to DeSmidt (1948:37):

Because the Indians were not familiar with military regulations governing dress they made some grave errors. Instead of wearing khaki, the image is painted so as to be wearing a green cap with a pink band and one white star. His coat was painted a powder blue with two pink breast pockets. Below the left pocket was what appears to be a German Iron Cross. He also wore a black bow tie and black pants. Although the Indians have small flat noses, they admire long pointed ones. They therefore made the image with a nose that projected three inches from the face.

Just before the ceremony begins each household prepares itself with a surplus of food, for during the chanting the village is completely sealed off; no one is allowed to leave, and visits from neighboring villagers are strictly prohibited. All trading boats by Colombia and Panama are warned against docking, and air traffic to the village is discontinued. Numerous ceremonial objects, such as clay incense burners, tobacco, and pipes, are collected and taken to the place where the ritual is to be performed. The ceremony usually takes place in the village gathering hall, which is the largest building available and is able to house the bulk of the adult male population; it is now called the ‘tobacco smoking house’ ( war uet neka). The 50 balsawood figures are brought in and placed in a line along one of the walls. Many privately owned nuchukuna are also taken to the ‘tobacco smoking house,’ where they serve as ‘assistants’ to the balsawood spirits. Finally, the carefully gathered medicines are taken to the hall and assembled in piles near the balsawood figures.

When all the preparations have been made, the ceremony begins. Adult males in the village are required to sit in the tobacco smoking house for the duration of Apsoket Ikar, which lasts eight consecutive days, from late afternoon until about midnight. Some older women may also attend, but this is not mandatory. Leading the ceremony are the principal Apsoket chanter, his assistants, and a nele, whose tasks are to keep spiritual vigil on community members, to ensure that everyone behaves correctly, and to monitor the efficacy of the chant and the ceremony in general. There are also several men in charge of periodically blowing tobacco smoke in the faces of all the participants (a prophylactic measure taken against ponikana), others to keep the clay braziers burning and primed with cacao seeds, others to take charge of the medicines, and still others to distribute tobacco in small gourd bowls. With the exception of the chanters, everyone is expected to smoke as much as possible during the ritual, and no one is allowed to nod off to sleep. If someone starts to doze, he is immediately shaken awake by his companions.

The chant begins with a lengthy description of the problems at hand, the ponikana who are responsible, and the events which led to their attack on the village (if this has occurred). Then the chanter brings the spirits of the balsawood figures to life and calls them to the tobacco smoking house. Numerous other spirit helpers are called to assist the balsawood shamans, including river agates, chile peppers, nuckukana of all types, bees, armadillos, sealing wax, plants with spines, nets, and vines. Once assembled in the tobacco smoking house, they are informed of their upcoming mission and instructed as to how they will be expected to perform their duties.

During the second day, chanting is aimed at bringing the medicines to life. As each medicine is mentioned, the assistants of the Apsoket chanter place it on hot coals in the clay braziers. The spirits of the medicines, transformed through incineration, comprise the key ingredients for a powerful intoxicating chicha ( inna) which the shamans will carry into the underworld to offer to the ponikana and render them helpless. Another potent ingredient is the spiritual essence of the tobacco the men in the hall are smoking.

The next four days of chanting are repetitions of the second day. The chicha is brewed, and by chanting the same verses and burning the same medicines for five days its strength is augmented. If anyone breaks wind during the ceremony the potency of the chicha will drop, and the culprit is immediately given a huge pipe stuffed with tobacco to smoke, a strategy which lifts the strength of the chicha back to its former level. A brigade of spirit women presides over the preparation of the chicha; they wander about invisibly among the participants, collecting the essence of the tobacco smoke and mixing it with the medicines in large (spiritual) clay pots.

The men return each evening to their homes to sleep after the chanting is finished. They are strictly forbidden sexual congress, and men and women keep interaction between them to an absolute minimum. Children are not allowed to play, and the streets at all hours are virtually empty. No one is allowed to make any sort of loud noise, for this would disrupt the fermentation of the chicha and cause its potency to drop. If someone is imprudent enough to engage in sex during the course of the ceremony, the spirits of the balsawood images will become angry. They may refuse to carry out their mission, or, more seriously, attack the Apsoket chanter and his assistants, causing them to become ill or die. Then, too, improper sex will cause the chicha to lose its strength. The presiding nele, who is posted in a hammock strung beside the chanter, is in constant touch with a contingent of nuchukana who patrol the village like policemen to ensure that everyone is behaving correctly. If anything occurs to upset the ceremony, the nele immediately dispatches his spirit helpers to investigate. When a villager is discovered transgressing the rules he is publically called to task, roundly admonished, and fined. This, of course, is a very serious matter, and to make certain such things do not occur, community leaders deliver strong counsel to the men in the tobacco smoking house before and after each evening of chanting.

On the seventh day, the chant changes its emphasis and the spirits of the balsawood leaders and their followers are directed to carry the chicha down to the domain of the ponikana on the fourth level of the spirit realm. As the massive force of spirits makes its way noisily past the communities of ponikana stretched along the route to the fourth level, it spreads fear and confusion. Once they have arrived at their destination, the balsawood shamans deal directly with the chief of the ponikana, who is variously called Kilu (‘Uncle’) Kwetuli, Kilu Ikkwali, or Kilu Salupip (Howe, personal communication 1976). The balsawood chiefs are the most intelligent of the spirit helpers of man, and are sometimes described as ‘lawyers,’ for they have come to argue the case of their clients (the Kuna) before the ponikana. The chicha is set out in pots in Kilu’s house, and he is told to round up all his ‘children’ (the ponikana) to come and partake of the festivities.

The balsawood shamans confront Kilu and frequently resort to deception to explain the disaster that has driven the ponikana amok. For example, if a tree belonging to a colony of ponikana has been felled by an irresponsible villager, the shamans say that it was not a Kuna who caused the damage but rather a strong wind. If a spirit whirlpool has been disrupted, they explain that it was done by an earthquake. The Kuna, they continue, were not responsible. Look, the shamans argue, they have sent you this excellent chicha to demonstrate their good will!

The ponikana arrive, drink without restraint, fight with each other, and pass out in heaps on the floor. Kilu, on the other hand, is not so easily dominated, for he knows a chant to ward of intoxication called Wipoet. The shamans produce a specially-prepared, more powerful chicha for Kilu, and he eventually falls comatose among the rest. The final day of the chant then describes how the spirit helpers grab the groggy ponikana with hooks, spines, nets, and baskets, bind them with vines and ropes, and drag them inside their stronghold. The shamans firm up the walls of Kilu’s domain with sealing wax, sticky sap, and vines and leave the ponikana with enough chicha to keep them occupied in the future. As the balsawood shamans prepare to depart, they inform Kilu and his ponikana that they should desists from attacking the Kuna since they are their friends. If the Kuna are planning to clear a ponikana sanctuary for the purpose of establishing a farm or erecting a building, the ponikana are instructed to cause them no harm. Then the shamans all beat a path back to the tobacco smoking house, having successfully completed their mission.

After the main chanting is finished, there are still two days of organized smoking for the men. The balsawood spirits are thanked warmly and sent back to their homes, as are the other spirits who have assisted. The nuchukana belonging to the village are posted to stand vigil over the community and guard against further attacks from the ponikana. From this point on, life in the community gradually returns to its normal routine.

One strategy used by Kuna curing specialists is the administration of medicines, which was discussed in Chapter Six. In this chapter I have discussed the second major curing strategy employed by the Kuna, which involves the performance of a series of more or less fixed-form ‘curing chants’ ( ikar). There exist approximately ten major curing chant traditions, and although each tradition serves the same curative purpose, there is a good deal of variation among the individual chants within each class. For example, ‘The Way of Muu’ is always performed to overcome difficult childbirth, yet there are numerous different versions of this chant in San Blas. However, given that any two versions are roughly equivalent in length, descriptive intricacy, and content, they are considered by the Kuna to be of similar efficacy.

Some of the chant traditions, such as ‘The Way of Cacao,’ are short, and are generally performed in less than 45 minutes. By contrast, chants such as ‘The Way of the Demon’ may stretch out for over four or five hours. The longest curing chant among the Kuna is ‘The Way of Conversing,’ which is usually performed for five or six hours daily over a period of eight consecutive days. In the eyes of the Kuna, the most powerful curing chants are those which possess the most complex structure, are the most difficult to learn, carry the most prestige, and present the greatest amount of danger to the specialists.

All curing chants, like the ‘medicine counselling chants,’ are performed in the ritual language, not colloquial Kuna. Although they are performed in the presence of patients -- which is not the case with medicine counselling chants -- their audience is not the patient, but rather the inhabitants of the realm of spirit. Consequently, their purpose is to advise and direct a host of shaman spirit allies to carry out curative action within that realm.

While Kuna specialists have no formal classificatory scheme for the curing chants, there exist two broad types: (1) “expedition” chants in which contingents of shaman spirits are sent into the levels of the cosmos to confront ponikana that have caused (or are threatening to cause) illness; and (2) curing chants which are similar to medicine counselling chants in both structure and general content. The expedition chants, which are the most numerous, can further be broken down into two subdivisions that are seen by the Kuna as being closely related: chants for ‘grabbing ponikana,’ and chants for recovering abducted purpakana.

The basic structure, or narrative sequence, of all of these expedition chants is similar. All summon hosts of shaman spirits, counsel them, and prepare them for journeys into the levels of the cosmos; they contain accounts of expeditions to the domains of the spirits causing the illnesses being treated; and they describe confrontations between the chanter’s shaman helpers and the illness-causing spirits, which leads to successful resolution of the problem at hand. Finally, they end with descriptions of the shaman spirits as they ‘stand vigil’ over the patient to guard against further incursions of ponikana

Kuna curing chants are best seen as something akin to scripts in which the events they describe actually take place in the world of spirit at the same time the specialists intone their chants. For example, when a chanter relates how the shamans in ‘The Way of Muu’ make their way past menacing jaguars inside the door of Muu’s house, the shamans are, at that very moment, confronting these animals on the fourth level of the cosmos. Thus, curing chanters are the master directors of extremely intricate and often dangerous dramas that unfold in the world of spirit. Not only do they guide their shaman allies in their quest through the cosmos; they also manipulate all of the remaining actors by placing dialogue in their mouths and orchestrating their behavior, as well as paint the contours of the landscape in which all of the action is set. The desired effect of curing chants is the creation of a powerful coercive force which pressures events in the world of spirit to fall in line with the desired end of the chanter, which is the restoration of well-being to the universe. If the chanter is skilled and this is accomplished, the patient he is treating will soon recover.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual255,"Girls' puberty rites, Inna rites","Puberty Rites and Festivities

The focus of the third Kuna ritual tradition is an important stage in the life cycle of a woman, puberty. Girls’ puberty rites—called inna rites, after the fermented drink which is consumed in large quantities during them—are sharply distinguished from the other two Kuna ritual traditions, the onmakket (gathering) tradition and the curing and magic tradition, by means of a separate ritual language, kantule kaya ( kantule language); a particular setting, the inna neka ( inna house); a distinct social organization, at the center of which is the kantule, the director of the ritual; and a special set of events and activities, official and unofficial, serious and playful. Many societies, including those of tropical forest South America, are reported to have both curing and magical rituals and puberty rituals. Belief in the existence of spirits and in the possibility of human-spirit communication is also common. What is special and significant about the Kuna is that curing and magic on the one hand and puberty on the other centrally and crucially involve human-spirit communication as well as two distinct speaking traditions and organizations. At the same time, these two traditions are also joined within the context of the puberty rites and festivities, during which both humans and spirits are intensely involved.  

Until she reaches puberty, a Kuna girl wears her straight hair long and flowing down her back. At puberty, her hair is ritually cut very short; it is kept short for the rest of her life. If he chooses to and if he can afford to, the girl’s father provides food for village-wide festivities. The entire community—which assists and cooperates by providing bananas and some fish—participates in eating this food and in drinking inna, as well as rum and beer. The central form of discourse at puberty rites is a long ikar (way, text) which is performed by the kantule and his student-assistants and addressed to the spirit of the kammu, a long flute, in the presence of the community, which drinks freely and participates in many types of activities and festivities. The most full blown and spectacular of the various puberty rites, in terms of length of time and degree of ceremonial activity, are the inna tunsikkalet (short inna), which lasts two days, and the inna suit (long inna), which lasts three or more days. There are no puberty rites for Kuna boys, although perhaps there used to be.

The puberty festivities are the only occasions on which the Kuna are permitted to drink alcoholic beverages in large quantities (some San Blas villages allow a beer at a store on ordinary evenings). When a girl’s father announces in the onmakket neka (gathering house) that he is planning to provide food for the festivities, the preparation of the inna begins (in a more general sense, these festivities are planned months and sometimes years ahead of time, and preparations also begin well ahead). On a set day, all the men of the village are required to gather sugarcane, each returning with a specified amount. The cane is then squeezed into juice in wooden squeezers or mills located outdoors throughout the village. Under the supervision of the inna sopet ( inna maker) and his student-assistants, the inna is prepared in the ‘ inna house,’ which contains the caldrons, long dugout river canoes, and jars used for this purpose.

The ‘ inna house,’ like the ‘gathering house,’ has exactly the same structure as all traditional Kuna houses and is built with the same materials. And, also like the ‘gathering house,’ it is a huge version of a Kuna house, capable of including the entire population of a village and outside visitors as well. On the island of Sasartii-Mulatuppu, the ‘ inna house’ is located between and parallel to the ‘gathering houses’ of the two separate villages of Mulatuppu and Sasartii. The three structures, all opening onto a large plaza, constitute an important and impressive central focus of the island. The ‘ inna house’ physically and symbolically links the two villages; both use it to prepare inna, and both participate together in the rituals and festivities within it. The ‘ inna house’ is kept closed during most of the year. It is opened and used only during the preparation of inna and food for the village-wide rites and festivities and during these rites and festivities.

The ‘ inna maker’ directs all the details of its preparation—the mixing of the ingredients, the cooking in large iron caldrons, the stirring in the long wooden pirogues, and the tasting. This specialist also performs, either in the presence of the fermenting sugarcane juice or in the privacy of his own home, inna sopet ikar (the way of the making of inna), a long chant addressed to the spirit of the inna which advises it to ferment properly. Like other magical ikarkana (see chapter 4), ‘the way of the making of inna’ demonstrates to the inna spirit the performer’s knowledge of its origin and essence and causes desired events to occur by means of a narration of them. This is one of several magical chants which are performed in order to insure that the various preparations for the puberty rites and festivities are properly carried out. Kammu suet ikar (the way of the getting of the flute) is performed as part of the preparation of the kantule’s very important flute. Kaspak ikar (the way of the hammock rope) is performed as part of the preparation of the hammock used by the kantule. And a curing-magical ikar often performed during the festivities themselves is wipoet ikar (the way of sobering up); addressed to the spirit of the inna by inebriated individuals, it functions to sober them up.

‘The way of the making of inna’ describes in detail the preparations for the puberty rites and festivities as well as the rites and festivities themselves. It is an excellent and precise verbal reflection of how these events actually proceed. Here the ‘ inna maker’ tastes the inna and decides when it will be strong enough to drink.

After five or six days of fermentation, the inna is tasted in order to decide when it will be ready to drink. The tasting is a public event; it takes place in either the ‘ inna house’ or the ‘gathering house’ and is attended by the ‘ inna maker’ and his assistants, who sit on a bench in front of the inna, as well as by many men who come in to observe. There is a lively, festive atmosphere, including considerable verbal play and amusement. The event is an appropriate precursor to the full-blown letting go of the actual festivities to follow.

When it is decided that the inna is ready to drink, the rites and festivities begin. A special enclosure is constructed for the young girl outside the ‘ inna house’ and she is placed within this enclosure and buried in the sand with only her head above ground. Within the enclosure, the iet (haircutter) and her assistants cut the girl’s long hair according to prescribed techniques. The women perform the nonverbal aspects of the ritual; the men perform the verbal. The rites include various official activities which are performed only on these occasions, as well as various unofficial activities which are associated with the festivities. One of the important official events is the selection of a secret nuka sunnat (true name) for the girl by the kantule.

The members of the community who are present in the ‘ inna house’ do not listen to the shouting of the kantule. They are typically quite drunk and involved in many sorts of activities. However, they are aware of the general content of ‘the way of the kantule’ and of its purpose and significance—they know that successful completion of the puberty rites depends on its performance and that they should be present.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Ritual256,The Day of the Red Dance,"The 'E-Unoto' Ceremony of the Masai

The cycle of ceremonies connected with the forming of a Masai age set starts with that known as eimpolosata , performed by the members of the age set immediately senior to the existing warrior set. These members are destined to become the instructors in tribal lore of the youths who are about to comprise the new age set. Em-polosata is followed by en-dungore which marks the end of the current circumcision. These two ceremonies are followed by a four-day dance of the initiates-to-be called en-kipaata ; and the circumcision of the new age set is carried out over the next three to four years, the youths being 14-17 years of age. Each generation is divided into Right Hand and Left Hand circumcisions; the latter begin their ceremonies about six to seven years after the former, but both cease to be warriors at the same time.

Seven years after the beginning of their circumcision, the members of the Right Hand Circumcision become senior warriors through the e-unoto . This ceremony, which is part of the age-set institutions, is held about every seven years, when an age set of junior muran (warriors) feels that it is sufficiently strong and mature to graduate into senior muran , and so ‘push’ the next senior warriors of the previous age set up into adult manhood. The word e-unoto is derived from the verb a-un , to plant upright or set up ( i.e. a new age set of senior warriors is ‘set up’) and, as will be seen below, certain things are ceremonially ‘set up’ in the manyata (warriors' kraal) where the ceremony is held.

Tribal elders choose a site for the ceremony, and there the muran who are to take part, aided by their mothers and girl friends, build a new kraal. Each young man has his own hut, a long, low building of withies, mud and cow dung. These are built in a circle, facing inwards. At night branches are pulled into the gaps between the huts to keep out wild beasts which might prey on the cattle sleeping in the arena encircled by the huts.

Besides choosing the site, the elders also select 49 muran from those about to take part in the ceremony. These 49 ‘pure ones’ as they are called must be young men of good character, 100 per cent. full-blooded Masai and without physical blemish. Their leader, the Ol-Otumo , is chosen secrctly and is not told of his appointment until the ceremony is due to start. Every murani dreads being called upon to fill the position for the Ol-Otuno is regarded as a scapegoat for the misdeeds of his fellows. They believe that if he dies young as a sacrifice for their sins, they will live long and prosper.

After the other huts have been built, the mothers of the 49 ‘pure ones’ build the sacred hut called O-Singira . This is a round building, also made of branches, mud and cow dung, topped with a conical roof of the same materials. Around its base is laid a circle of bullocks' skulls on which are left the horns and a strip of skin running down the face. Inside, in the centre of the O-Singira , the Ol-Otuno ‘sets up’ a stick of the wild olive tree ( Olea chrysophylla ) and so receives his name which means ‘He-who-set-it-up.’ The doorway of the O-Singira faces that of the Ol-Otuno's hut, next to which is that of his assistant known as ‘The Cutter-up of the Hide.’

The e-unoto of the Loita division of the Masai was held on 10-13 June, 1959, at Entasekera in southern Kenya. The youths taking part were of the right-hand circumcision, the members of which are known as Il-Deregeyani .

The ceremony lasts for four days, and the first of these is called ‘The Day of the Red Dance.’ As dawn breaks, all the people assemble outside their facing east. Four elders chant a prayer calling on every man to love his neighbour, and the crowd then call ‘Hoi-yoor’ three times--a form of ‘amen.’ In the centre of the arena--about 70 yards across--some long poles were ‘set up’ in the ground. To the tops of these were tied some of the ostrichfeather headdresses which Masai muran like to wear; and on the branches of nearby trees were more of these and also a number of the conical hats made from lions' manes--not unlike guardsmens' bearskins--which are worn on ceremonial occasions by those who have killed a lion with a spear.

The muran taking part in the Red Dance wear a single garment consisting of a length of russet-coloured calico knotted over the right shoulder and hanging down to the thighs. Their hair is worn shoulder-length (a feature of the young men of pastoral tribes of East Africa), and the whole body is smeared, from the crown of the head down, with a mixture of red mud and beef fat. The dancers gather together into groups of a dozen or more, all facing inwards towards a small open space. One young man steps forward into this space, makes a few prancing dance steps, and then starts to jump perpendicularly up and down, his long hair flying up above his head into a kind of halo at the top of each jump.

Meanwhile the other dancers chant and grunt, awaiting their turn to jump. Now and then this type of dancing was abandoned and the dancers formed up to single file, going in procession back and forth across the centre of the manyatta . As the number of dancers increased, the young men became more and more excited and soon a number were throwing fits. Foaming at the mouth, eyes staring, arms rigid at right angles to the body the sufferers stagger wildly about until friends come to their aid and hold them down. These fits are caused by the habit of drinking an infusion of the bark of certain trees, a relic of the old cattle-raiding days, for when the fit has passed the sufferer loses all fear and is ready for battle. An unusual feature of the drug is that, once in a man's system, its effects last for life, and, given sufficient excitement, the man is liable to fits for the rest of his days.",0,1,1,0,1,0

Ritual257,"The Day of the White Dance, Part 1","The second day of e-unoto is called ‘The Day of the White Dance.’ Soon after sunrise the muran went off into the bush to paint their bodies with diatomite. This white, chalklike substance is brought on foot from the Eburru Mountains near Naivasha in The Rift Valley. To bring it, two senior muran of good character are chosen, and they go off dressed in women's clothing and ornaments, carrying bamboo staves and cattle-branding tools as a sign that they are on a peaceful errand. Nearing the destination they stalk the diatomite as if it were game. Then they give the warcry of old: ‘I am the son of So-and-So,’ and ‘I am the Son of Such-and-Such’ and drive their branding irons into the outcrop. They fill their gourds with it and then return home and are treated with great reverence at Masai villages en route , being fed on a hot mixture of milk and water, known as ‘blue water.’",0,1,1,0,1,0
Ritual258,"The Day of the White Dance, Part 2","Once painted, the young men formed into two columns, some so yards apart, and marched to the village. Many wore ostrich headdresses and some the lion-mane caps. Around their necks and waists they wore gaily coloured lengths of calico and beaded thongs secured crescent-shaped bells to their thighs. The clashing of the bells was deafening. This return journey to the village is carefully planned so that the young men do not have to walk through or near any water or cross a stream. On nearing the village, the columns counter-marched, then joined together into double file and entered the arena. As they passed, their mothers called out: ‘Endopok !’--‘May you survive!’--but many of the women were busy attending to those throwing fits. There were a number of very violent ones as soon as the columns had passed within the circle of houses. Then the columns split up into groups and marched back and forth across the arena, each group led by an elder blowing a kudu horn (one of the very few Masai musical instruments). Now and then two groups would halt and, forming line, kneel and bow to one another; or to the O-Singira hut.

Late in the afternoon of this day the mothers of the 49 ‘pure ones’ shave their sons' heads. All the hair, eyebrows included, is removed by means of a spatulate Masai razor. Milk is used in place of soap. Whilst being shaved, each young man squats in front of his hut on the ceremonial hide on which, as a boy, he had sat to be circumcised, and which, in future, will form the top layer of his mother's bed. A little of the hair from the Ol-Otuno and his lieutenant is also put in their mothers' beds, the remainder being thrown into the calf pens which form a part of their family home. Great care is taken that none is left lying about in the open in case birds should use it for their nests--a grave affront to the young men's sacred role.

During the course of the day the branches used as night barricades between the houses were replaced with new ones bearing green leaves. This is a symbolic act, meant to ensure that the muran may flourish as ‘green bay trees.’",0,1,1,0,1,0
Ritual259,The Day of the Sacred Hut,"The third day is called ‘The Day of the Sacred Hut.’ During the morning a heifer, a gift to the Ol-Otuno from his father, is driven into the bush and slaughtered. This animal, called ‘The Cow of the Rings,’ must be a first-calver, well built, and black with a white bclly. All the muran gathered at the slaughtering place to receive their rings from ‘The Cutter-up of the Hide,’ whilst their families waited in the village in an atmosphere of great expectancy.

Late in the afternoon the first of the muran , naked and still whitened with diatomite, came running back to his hut. There be received a deafening welcome from his family, whom he then led in a boisterous procession round and round the sacred hut. Soon, the whole arena was full of muran leading their families round the O-Singira , everyone shouting and highly excited. Each young man wore, on the third finger of his left hand, a ring from the hide of the Ol-Otuno's heifer. These rings are really only strips of hide about four inches long with a hole near one end to take the wearer's finger. After a time, the ‘pure’ 49 arrived, their shaven heads gleaming, white circles of diatomite like spectacles round their eyes and garlands of green leaves round their necks. They stood in a group near the O-Singira whilst the Ol-Otuno was led to his hut. In front of his doorway was placed the hide on which he had sat to be shaved, and on this was set his three-legged stool, and into its concave seat was poured a mixture of water, milk and honey. The Ol-Otuno , who seemed all too conscious of his role of scapegoat, then sat on the stool.

Ritual260,Circumcision (E-murrata),"Circumcision (E-murrata)

Boys' circumcision ceremonies take place at intervals of about three years, and the circumcision period is “open” for about four years. Though the operation may be performed on boys singly or in small groups, the whole number of those circumcised at the same time throughout Masailand forms an associating group corresponding in some degree to the Nandi mat (see pp. 31 and 49). Judging by the published accounts, circumcision was a much less prolonged and ceremonious affair than among the Nandi. Before a boy can be circumcised, the father must submit to what is called em-polosata e-sita , “the passing of the fence.” After making honey-wine, he stays alone in a small hut outside his kraal, dressed as a warrior. After four days, some elders bring him back to his kraal, where he is told to remove the warrior's clothes and become an old man. His son may then be circumcised.

Circumcision begins with the shaving and bathing of the initiate; in the afternoon after this has been done an ox or sheep is killed and eaten by the warriors and elders of the neighbourhood. On the second day, the boy cuts a tree called at this time e-latim , which the girls of the kraal carry to the door of the hut [in which the boy sleeps?], where it is planted. On the third morning the boy gets up early and sits outside to get cold; after sunrise he is circumcised, the operator being often a Dorobo. from the fourth to the seventh day he remains at home, and then goes out, shooting with blocked arrows at the girls, and with other arrows at small birds which he wears hung from his head. This is his occupation till he has recovered: during this time he is known as o-sipolioi and wears the dress of a married woman, including the i-surutia ear-rings, and an ostrich-feather on his head. After recovery he is shaved, given weapons and warrior's clothes, and becomes ol-barnoti , “the shaved one,” i.e., a junior warrior. Till his local company forms its manyata , he lives at home.

Girls undergo the operation of clitoridectomy in preparation for marriage. There are no special times for this. An ox or sheep is killed before the operation. During the period of recovery they are known as e-sipolioi , and wear on their heads a wreath of the Hyph[unknown] ne palm, ol-mcrisian , or of grass, instead of an ostrich feather.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual260,Circumcision (E-murrata),"The Circumcision Ordeal

The boys' dancing festival is normally held during the heavy spring rains when a large gathering becomes feasible. The boys then return to their herding duties for the long dry summer season. Those that have truanted have this period in which to face their father's beating and make their peace. The timing of initiation - the lunar month, the day of the lunar month, the time of day - is sometimes determined by family custom, adopted by some ancestor in an attempt to reverse misfortune. The most popular time is during the easier period following the late autumn rains. At this time, each family is better able to adjust to the loss of their most proficient herdboys, who in addition must be fed with special food as initiates. However, as certain families are obliged by their custom to initiate during the summer months, a few circumcisions take place of boys who are the forerunners ( ilngeetiani ) of their age-set. By November when the spate of circumcisions is reached, the sight of initiates is no longer a complete novelty. But this is a point when their numbers steadily accumulate, roaming the countryside in small groups, and gathering together for dances, especially at each new circumcision. There now is a distinct awareness that a new age-set is visibly and audibly emerging.

There is normally only one circumciser covering a wide area, and he can only visit one or perhaps two neighbouring villages on any morning. While the summer demand is relatively light, he can accommodate family preferences simply by staying overnight in one village and then moving on to the next village during the day. The preference for some extended families to come together to initiate their sons in the same village even simplifies his itinerary. However, the spate of demands in the autumn coupled with lineage preferences make it impossible for him to thread his way round his area in a systematic manner, village by village. Because of family custom or because a boy cannot be spared from herding at just this point, some do not take advantage of the circumciser's visit when other initiations are to be carried out in their own village. Families with identical preferences for particular days - say the ninth day of the lunar month - will be competing for his services. The general impression is of a certain confusion that heightens the awareness of change within the age system. As the circumciser zigzags on his itinerary in response to the pressure of demand, he is obliged to modify his plans by the insistence of certain forceful fathers, and in yielding to their pressures, he finds it impossible to keep promises elsewhere. Anxious families are kept in anticipation and eventually may have to bow to expedience and override lineage restrictions adding to their own anxieties. Or they may increase the pitch of their demand, adding to the pressure on the circumciser and to anxiety elsewhere.

This is not the only source of anxiety. It is held that if an initiate has committed adultery with a married women and does not confess, then this will lead to the death of his parents, and the circumciser, and the man who holds him from behind during the operation. On the whole, adultery by boys appears to be quite rare and if the initiate is innocent then this belief does not add to his own apprehensiveness. However, others can never be absolutely certain of his innocence, and Maasai boys are assumed to be unprincipled liars. Disbelieving fathers, adulterous sons and even sons who are quite innocent may find their fears brought to a head at this point by the speculation, boosted by rumours of people in the past who died because boys bluffed their innocence. Some time before the operation, the firestick patrons warn the boys of the circumciser's deadly curse on adulterers so that they can carefully consider their position. When he comes to perform the operation, the circumciser himself explains to each boy that he has placed a curse on his razor that will kill him if he does not confess his adulteries. If the boy confesses, then he is shamed but misfortune is averted. If he asserts his innocence, then a shadow of uncertainty always remains, and this becomes another source of speculation if the operation has any adverse effect.  

After being warned by the circumciser regarding any adulteries, the initiate is briefly washed and then signifies his readiness by kicking over a pot of water. One man, usually a mother's brother, holds him firmly from behind while two others hold his legs apart. The operation may last five minutes and during this period, the initiate should not bat an eyelid or even twitch a toe. To do so would be regarded as a sign of wanting to run away. He would be beaten for his cowardice as a flincher ( olkaasiodi ). If he then loses his head and struggles, he would be firmly held down and the operation completed to bring the matter to a speedy end. All festivity would be suspended, his family would be scorned, his mother and their cattle would be beaten. During the coming months he would be avoided by other initiates, at the very time when they are congratulating each other on their courage and forming lasting friendships. Flinching is a disastrous start for a future career as a moran, but it is a disaster from which he can recover. It is recognised that involuntary twitches are possible even among the bravest boys, while cowards may survive the ordeal with unexpected composure. There is even a hint of respect for a flincher in the maxim, ‘A man will not run away twice.’ In other words, the stigma of having flinched may provide the impetus to assert himself with obsessive courage on all subsequent occasions, just as a moran who loses his nerve in the heat of battle may subsequently show a fierce courage. Others may avoid him for a time, but they are careful not to tease him or humiliate him unnecessarily. Inwardly, he has a burning passion to redeem himself.

The ordeal for the initiate begins from the time that he is made aware of the possibility of flinching as a painful thought. He has years to prime himself for something that can never quite be known until it has been experienced. This is the third source of anxiety and it also bears on the fate of the circumciser who faces a different ordeal. It is believed that if no boy flinches in the course of a season of initiations, then the circumciser will meet an early death. This is one reason why no Maasai would normally accept the task, and it is usually undertaken by a skilled man from elsewhere who is prepared to take the risk. He is despised as a scavenger, a dorobo , whose greed for the payment outweighs his prudence. It is therefore in his interest to retain a reputation for skill, while making this a painful operation in the hope that he may snick some hidden nerve and cause an involuntary twitch. Technically, the initiate would have flinched even if someone inadvertently nudges him, and his kinsmen are said to watch the operation very closely: the initiate for signs of a twitch, the circumciser for some dirty trick, and any spectator close by who might nudge him. Sometimes they may even form a close protective ring round the operation to keep possible ill-wishers at bay (cf. Fox 1931:191).

Immediately after a successful operation - with no flinching or admission of adultery - the initiate is offered stock by various close members of his family amounting to perhaps five or more cattle. He then gets up, and in doing so forfeits the right to further cattle on this occasion. He may therefore remain in the circumcision posture until he is satisfied that the gifts he has been promised match the wealth of his kinsmen and his own expectations as a herdboy who has served his family well. He is then carried or led backwards to his mother's hut by the man at his back. Other local elders have a clear idea how many cattle he can reasonably expect and if he stubbornly makes unrealistic demands, they will start to shout at him. In the final resort, he would simply be dragged backwards to his mother's hut, overriding his protests.

Generally, there is a festive atmosphere surrounding a circumcision as described in the previous chapter, and the operation itself is quickly and efficiently dispatched, normally very early in the morning. Even so, it is a tense episode and a degree of confusion and anxiety appears to be an integral part of the ceremony, heightening the sense of occasion. Those close to the initiate and others that have recently been circumcised may deliberately try to provoke his anger, scorning and threatening him, and distancing themselves from him if he does flinch, but also firming his resolve not to do so. In his isolation, he is primed for the ordeal. For want of a Matapato example, it is useful to note an incident that occurred elsewhere.

Case 11 .
During a brief visit to the Siria Maasai where the age cycle was several years ahead of Matapato, a male circumcision was performed. At dawn, a band of about ten initiates, who had recently recovered from the operation and wore their full regalia, led the youth from his mother's hut, singing and holding each arm. His movements were wooden and his face seemed drained of all vitality. The circumciser led him outside the village, smeared a line of chalk on either side of his own and the boy's eyes, and reminded him of the procedure (and of his conditional curse?). The band of initiates then led him by the arm to a nearby spring to wash him and then returned. They paused at certain points, singing and making pointed references to the fact that none of them had flinched. At the father's gateway, he was left standing alone. Following Siria custom, instead of kicking over a pot of water, he was obliged to run from the gateway to his mother's hut where a firestick patron would souse him with water. Then he should snatch a hide and run with it to the circumciser waiting to operate in the middle of his father's corral. On this occasion, he rushed to his mother's hut, was soused and grabbed the hide, and then by mistake he rushed with it back to the gateway. Here, the other initiates grappled with him while he seemed to be fighting his way to leave the village. They dragged him struggling to the right spot, sat him on the hide, and the operation began promptly. Everyone's attention was drawn to the operation itself. No-one seemed to be watching whether he actually batted an eyelid or twitched a toe. An elderly woman (his mother?) with a close view of the operation was shivering throughout, a young elder (a close kinsman) who held his right leg during the operation looked quite shaken, and there was mild shivering among the band of initiates. The initiate himself remained expressionless and motionless. After the operation which lasted perhaps five minutes, he was given milk in a gourd to drink. The two elderly women spectators kissed his cheek, new sandals were placed on his feet, he was briefly offered cattle (the number appeared to have been agreed in detail beforehand) and then led backwards to his mother's hut.
The elders adjourned to a separate part of the hut to drink beer and joke about the operation emphasising gleefully to me how much it hurt: ‘like fire!’. No-one suggested that the initiate had tried to run away, or that his shaken kinsman who held his leg felt that family honour had been tarnished. They argued that the initiate was just confused in his ‘anger’ and had lost his bearings, and that any kinsmen may feel distressed during the operation. Generally, there was satisfaction that the operation had been carried out without a hitch. The elders then called over smaller boys to tease them, playfully dragging them towards the doorway and asking them if they would like to be circumcised. Outside, catching this jocular mood, some women seized several young children. One of them started to prise out their lower incisors as if to emphasise to them the ordeal that awaited them, hooting with laughter while the children howled. (Maasai generally have denied that the ordeal of teeth-prising and circumcision are deliberately linked when I have discussed this episode with them).

Following the operation, the initiate recuperates in his mother's hut, revived by a mixture of sour milk and blood ( saroi ). Prolonging his ordeal with one final gesture, the circumciser may enter the hut and reiterate his curse: if the boy is an unconfessed adulterer, then the drink will ‘poison’ him.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual261,Ordination of Buddhist Priest,"Twice a month, on the last day of the waxing moon and the waning moon respectively, one of the experienced monks, usually the abbot, has to recite the whole text of the P[unavailable][unknown]imokkha for the congregation of monks. This recitation is in the P[unavailable]li language, and may last for as long as three quarters of an hour. In rural areas, where outside the Lenten season an abbot may not be assured of a quorum of four monks, this solemn recitation takes place only during phans[unavailable]a.

Whilst Tambiah was probably mistaken when he wrote that newly ordained monks have to learn the P[unavailable][unknown]imokkha by heart, 1 for this would be an immense burden needlessly imposed, the inexperienced monks have to say a short formula as part of the preparation for the recitation. This formula is known as the [unknown] 'aabàd, exposing the ecclesiastical offences, sometimes known in the literature as the monks' confession. The confessing phígsù' approaches a monk of his own choice, squats and raises his hands palm to palm. The confessor acknowledges the situation by taking a similar position close by the confessing monk and by imitating the hand gesture.

In theory, the P[unavailable]li formula for confession should be repeated for each category of mistakes which the monk wishes to expose. Moreover, the exact wording should vary according to whether the monk has transgressed only once, twice or more often in the category of mistakes. The confession per category of offences requires a thorough knowledge of the different categories of ecclesiastical offences as well as a working knowledge of P[unavailable]li and is therefore seldom used in rural areas. Instead, a single formula which covers most transgressions is used. In a community like Wád Săancâw it consists merely of a short barrage of questions and answers in the P[unavailable]li language.

While [unknown] 'aabàd is compulsory immediately before the recitation of the P[unavailable][unknown]imokkha, a monk may approach a fellow phígsù' for confession any time he wishes. Especially after the main meal, many monks may take advantage of the proximity of a fellow monk to recite the formula. In some cases the preference for this time of the day may also be related to a wish to avoid part of the communal task of cleaning the eating place. The formula is easy to remember, and one month after ordination most monks will be able to recite it without hesitation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual262,"Chanting, Part 1","Chanting

The regular handbook for inexperienced monks, the Sùadmon Cèd Tamnaan contains many of the P[unavailable]li texts which are often chanted by the monks. They are a mixture of passages from the canon and short verses composed in later times by famous monks. There are chants for early in the morning, chants for auspicious occasions, hymns with deep philosophical meaning, reflections on food and clothing and texts to be recited at funerals. Most of these texts have been translated adequately into English.

During the Lenten season the monks chant P[unavailable]li texts in unison many times a day, sometimes for prolonged periods, but on other occasions the recitation may last only a few minutes. In most monasteries there are four major chanting sessions: at four o'clock in the morning, at nine, early in the afternoon and just before sunset. During the longer chanting periods the monks sit facing a Buddha image, the hands raised palm to palm in front of the chest in orderly rows. The abbot sits in front, the most recent additions to his chapter sit in the back. The abbot indicates which text will be used by chanting the first word of that text. All the monks join in, with loud voices at the same pitch.

An inexperienced monk usually does not know these P[unavailable]li texts by heart. During the communal chanting sessions in the monastery when no laymen are present he is allowed to take his copy of the Sùadmon Cèd Tamnaan with him. Therefore he is able to chant in unison with the experienced monks as soon as he has found the printed text in his handbook.

Since the monk can use a book during these communal chanting sessions, there would seem to be no need for him to memorize the passages. However, many industrious recently ordained monks can be seen during spare moments whilst they read these P[unavailable]li texts in a loud voice in order to commit them to memory. One of the main incentives for learning the texts by heart is the consideration that during ceremonies when laymen are involved no textbooks may be used.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual263,"Chanting, Part 2","On each wanphrâ', four times a month, a numerous lay congregation gathers in the monastery and observes the monks perform certain ceremonial acts which include chanting auspicious stanzas. In addition there are often ceremonies outside the monastery whereby a chapter of monks is invited to chant for a group of laymen. These ceremonies can be connected with the stages of the life-cycle such as birth, first haircutting, marriage and death, or with the fertility of the fields, rainmaking, entering a new house and the increase of the prosperity of a certain family.

During all these ceremonies when the members of the Sa[unknown]gha perform a ritual for laymen, the monks sit on a dais facing the laymen. The monks recite P[unavailable]li texts for a considerable period, sometimes as short as a quarter of an hour, but often much longer, thus causing a bowl of water to be charged with beneficial power. Usually all the texts which are recited can be found in Sùadmon Cèd Tamnaan. A rather detailed description of the texts chanted in the presence of laymen in north-east Thailand shows great similarity with central Thai practices.

On wanphra' all inexperienced monks participate in the ritual, but occasionally a newly ordained monk may also be invited to chant at private homes, usually when the ritual takes place in the house of a close relative. At such occasions the laymen can observe whether a newly ordained man can already join in the chanting of texts or whether he has to sit silently while his fellow monks recite. After a man has been a phígsù' for several months, it is expected of him that he take part in most chants. Inexperienced monks may feel quite embarrassed when the leader of a chapter of monks chooses a text which they have not yet mastered. Some monks may try to hide their lack of knowledge by extending a breathing pause, or by simulating a cough during difficult parts of the text, and then resuming the recitation during the easy, repetitive parts. However, they have little chance to mislead the audience with such simulated knowledge of P[unavailable]li texts, because most of the adult men in the audience have been monks themselves and are quite capable of detecting the ignorance of the inexperienced monks.

One of the incentives for learning the texts by heart is therefore the wish to avoid embarrassment during ceremonies involving laymen. In addition, a monk who is known as someone who chants well may be invited more often to perform ceremonies for laymen than the monk who cannot recite with ease. As it is the custom to reward all monks who perform ceremonies outside the monastery with money as well as with other gifts, there is also a financial incentive for learning to chant expertly.

The money presentation is always kept apart from the presentation of additional gifts, because the rules of the order forbid monks to handle money. With regard to monks and money the rural people interpret the rules rather loosely and in many instances these rules are broken openly. This is discussed later in this chapter; for the purpose of this description it suffices to note that the written rules have at least an influence upon the moment and manner of ritual presentation.

The traditional gifts to the members of a chapter of monks always include incense, a candle and a flower. In addition there is often a presentation of some useful practical objects such as plates, a toothbrush, soap powder, toilet paper and matches. It is customary to donate identical gifts to all monks who participate. The decisions regarding donations rest, however, with the lay organisers and variations occur sometimes in the amounts of money distributed to the monks. For example, if one of the monks outranks the other members of the Sa[unknown]gha by far, the lay organisers may donate a greater amount to this monk than to the remaining phígsù's.

In a rather unusual decision, the laymen of Wád Săancâw decided to remunerate the experienced monks with a greater amount than the inexperienced ones:

1 June 1968:

… a well-to-do layman invited thirteen monks from three different monasteries to chant in his house. Many of the monks happened to be inexperienced, recently ordained monks, and the oldest, highest ranking monk present was more than 80 years old. This venerable phígsù' chose to chant texts which almost none of the other members of the chapter knew, and the sound of the recitation became very meagre indeed.
The house-owner conferred softly with several other laymen present, and after the ceremony, when publicly announcing the amount of the donation, he stressed: “In this case we donate fifty baht to each of the four members of the Sa[unknown]gha who used their voices, and only half that amount to the remaining monks”.

On any ordinary day during the Lenten period, the total time spent by the monks in communal chanting without a lay audience varies possibly from two to four hours. During the chanting sessions of a rural monastery, the abbot seldom varies the first and last text. In addition, during the periods of communal recitation the abbot gradually works through more texts which can be used on special occasions, such as funerals or housewarmings. Both types of texts occur in Sùadmon Cèd Tamnaan. Usually the abbot chooses from the varying texts those which the monks have not chanted recently and each section of common chanting will be recited in unison at least once a week. Often it will take a monk two Lenten seasons before he masters all major texts; it is only the exceptional individual who commits them all to memory during his first year in the Sa[unknown]gha. Most monks end their first Lenten period being capable of reciting only the texts which are used every day.

Even the most experienced monks find it difficult to chant individually. During the recitations in unison with others each individual can rely on the memory of those around him. The drone of many voices is slightly soporiferous, and the experienced monk often chants in a completely relaxed manner. If, however, asked to chant alone, even an ‘easy text’ suddenly becomes difficult. When chanting alone a monk is suddenly forced to remember sequences of words which he normally produces automatically in unison with others.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual264,Meditation,"Meditation

One of the skills, intimately linked with beneficial magical power, which greatly increases the store of merit, and which carries great prestige is the concentration in a proper manner: the practice of meditation. All inexperienced monks in rural monasteries have to take part in communal sessions and are expected to practise the skill in private. There are indications that meditation is less important in the urban setting where traditional skills have sometimes been supplanted by the study for certificates. 

During the Lenten season, the abbot of Wád S˘aancâw leads the monks during the late afternoon chanting. After the recitation of general texts from the Sùadmon Cèd Tamnaan and before the krùadnáam ritual he usually inserts a period of communal meditation. At a sign from the abbot all monks depart from their ‘polite’ chanting position and seat themselves comfortably with the legs folded in front of the body and the hands placed palms upwards in the lap. The abbot then instructs the inexperienced monks in various techniques of meditation. They should close the eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. As an aid to breathing properly, he advises them to think of an auspicious word whilst they breathe. For example, with the auspicious name Buddho, the meditating monks should think of the syllable Bud- while breathing in and of -dho during the exhalation. If the word arahant is used, ara- is reserved for inhalation, -hant to breathe out.

Apart from the instruction on purely technical matters, the abbot may introduce a theme upon which to concentrate. Usually he holds a short monologue during which he introduces a subject which will help a monk to obtain the proper attitude towards his environment. Common themes are: the inevitable decay of all surroundings; people grow older and die but so do plants and even the buildings of the monastery will last only a while before falling to ruin; and the futility of the hankering after pleasures which cause a person to accumulate harmful karma.

The abbot may recite the pañcakakamma[unknown][unknown][unavailable]na, a formula which mentions the five elements that can be found in all creatures: hair on the head, hair on the body, nails, teeth and skin. This also serves to put the monks in the right frame of mind. During the abbot's monologue, all monks sit with their eyes closed, and practise the breathing technique whilst concentrating on the topic the abbot has chosen. When the abbot has finished speaking it becomes very quiet in the bòod; only the sounds from the world outside may penetrate the building. In this atmosphere each monk should try to lower his consciousness while remaining fully alert.

The inexperienced monks may find it difficult to relax and remain concentrated. After a few minutes some usually cannot remain quiet; they begin to fidget, look around or feel that they should scrape their throat. These interruptions are usually soon followed by the abbot's announcement that the meditation is finished for the day, and that the krùadnáam recitation is to begin. However, near the end of the Lenten season, when all monks have been members of the Sa[unknown]gha for several months, the communal meditation sessions can be prolonged without any disturbance from the recently ordained monks.

The precepts of the monks as laid down in the P[unavailable][unknown]imokkha forbid any monk to talk about extraordinary experiences during meditation. The most severe category of rules, the p[unavailable]r[unavailable]jik[unavailable] section discussed earlier in this chapter, contains a clause which forbids a monk to lie about his magical powers. In Thailand this rule is understood to include lies about strange experiences whilst meditating. It is less generally known that a rule from the fifth category of prescriptions, the p[unavailable]cittiy[unavailable], forbids monks even to tell the truth about his magical experiences.

Although many monks will therefore not speak about their feelings when practising meditation, the restrictions do not apply once the monk has become a layman again. It is commonly known amongst men that there are some people who are rewarded for their efforts by visions of colours and unidentifiable shapes. Some report hearing extraordinary sounds. It may safely be assumed, however, that the communal sessions are of too short a duration to bring about such experiences, and many a monk will try to induce them in the privacy of his cell. Times which are especially recommended for private meditation are early in the morning, before the food collecting takes place, and just before Lying down to sleep late at night.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual265,Funeral,"The most important festivity for any person is his cremation, as distinct from his death. Except for special emergencies, the two are ordinarily separated by a time span varying from one hundred days to several years. While cremation always takes place at a temple, death rites occur anywhere, though preferably at the home of the deceased. By tying the hands and feet of the corpse, providing it with money, covering the face with a wax mask, and nailing up the coffin, the survivors seek to protect the living from a potentially hostile spirit. The removal of the body through the wall of the house and its delivery to the temple further underscore protection. When the priests read sermons at the household of the deceased, not only does the spirit gain merit for a future life but the inhabitants of the household are fortified against the spirit, should it return to its former home. Thus death rites are prophylactic against petulant ghosts, while cremation rites dispatch the spirit from this world.

A cremation festivity ( ng[unavailable]n phao sob), particularly one of some pretension, requires months of advance preparation. Large sums of money must be collected from affluent relatives just to begin to buy food for a thousand meals, robes for fifty priests, and presents for five hundred guests. During the 1940s and 1950s Bang Chan hosts sent out invitations printed in Bangkok. Nowadays, also in the Bangkok mode, the occasional host in the countryside may reprint, as a favor for his guests, a book of Buddhist precepts with a brief biography of the deceased. Frequently he hires from Bangkok a handsome bier complete with gilded angels and a generator to power fluorescent lights. An undertaker prepares the body and manages the pyre; a carver of banana stalks ornaments the cremation platform; flower arrangers deck the bier and make bouquets to give away; an orchestra plays throughout the day and night. A theatrical performance, and possibly also a shadow play or movie, will entertain the guests. If people have been invited from the capital, it is necessary to arrange transportation, perhaps even build a special road to help the buses come near the temple. So 15,000 baht is not an unusual initial outlay (Janlekha 1957:149).

This period of preparation necessarily overlaps the time for welcoming guests. The first to arrive, the near kinsmen, are set to work grating coconuts or pressing eggs through a sieve to make golden-thread sweets. Someone must fetch the priests from the more distant temples. Others escort the arriving priests to their prearranged cushions in the pavilion. As lay guests enter, the host personally receives their contributions and ensures that they are fed. Finally when the temple, filled with people clad in their best, vibrates with the music of gongs, drums, and oboes, the gods and demigods are invited to descend from the heavens to protect the assemblage from danger.

Already the rites have begun. Holding the sacred cotton cord that leads inside the bier to the bones, the corps of priests chants sutras for the deceased; the emanations following the sacred cord invigorate his soul. Sermons add to the merit. Now and then the orchestra proclaims to the heavens via loudspeakers that another soul is about to arrive from the earth. During the last night on earth the deceased is diverted by dramatic performances. Next morning he gains further merit through feeding the priests and hearing other sermons.

About four o'clock in the afternoon the undertaker removes from the bier a small tinseled box containing the bones of the deceased. A procession headed by chanting priests moves from the pavilion, leading the box by the sacred cord. Kinsmen fall into line behind the priests. The way is short, for the cremation platform, resplendent with carved banana stalks and garlands of flowers, lies nearby in the temple courtyard. Slowly the procession winds around this platform, three times in counterclockwise direction, for the way of death is opposite the way of life. At last the carriers place the box of bones on the pyre, while the priests relinquish the sacred cord. All guests, in approximate order of their eminence, file past the pyre, make final obeisance, and contribute to the pyre the incense sticks and faggots provided by the host. As each guest descends from the platform, a kinsman hands him a token of gratitude for his work: a handkerchief, a bouquet of flowers, sometimes a book.

All the guests have gathered in a great circle about the pyre, and the moment to light the fire has come. First some honored guest adds a final increment of merit by giving away another robe to each of the priests in the name of the deceased. Then as the flames rise, the undertaker breaks a coconut and pours its milk over the skull. Soon he is dousing the faggots with water to make the fire burn more slowly. Suddenly a hiss followed by an explosion indicates that a fireworks display has begun; thunderous rockets tell the heavens that a soul has departed from the earth. At this time many guests take leave, though the host may have arranged for another evening of feasting and dramatics to please those who wish to remain. A few may still be present on the following morning when the undertaker, accompanied by a near kinsman and a priest, returns to the cold ashes of the pyre. After a blessing by the priest, the undertaker fashions two manikins, one said to represent the former person, the other the future body to enhance rebirth. The kinsman then takes a bone home to keep in an urn, while the undertaker disposes of the remainder.

What transformations have been effected? A merit-filled soul has been dispatched from the earth, thereby relieving the people of the dangers of a roaming spirit. It has begun a course of travels that will end, if all goes properly, with rebirth into one of the households of its kinsmen. Thus the cycle of life has been continued. As for the survivors, they have been reminded of the impermanence of life and the importance of merit. Through their stores of merit they have survived the dangers of this period, and they need not yet experience the agony of their own deaths. The host, seeing the great crowds that answered his summons, counts his blessings, and people praise him as a generous host, a rich man, a potential leader.

In the sense that a festivity requires the labor of many to effect a transformation in life, the period since World War II clearly has been a festivity in Bang Chan. The once isolated rustic community has been transformed into something of a suburb. It is still too soon to say whether the ritual actions are producing a transition, as from youth to adulthood, or a transfiguration, as from life to death. Another few years will show the outcome more clearly, yet even now we can observe most of the preparations, the welcoming of many guests, some of the rites, and a few of the transformations.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Ritual266,Lenten Period?,"The Lenten Period

The Lenten period, commonly known as Phansa, begins on the 15th day of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month (usually July), and lasts through the 15th day of the waxing moon of the eleventh month (usually October).

On the first day of the Lenten period (a holy day), there is a special meeting in the bod at 4:00 p.m. After the regular preliminary ceremony has taken place (see later), the abbot extols the merits of being a monk, explains to the monks their duties, urges them not to argue or fight with one another, and informs them of the wat regulations and the wat boundaries. The monks then file out (the abbot last) and ask forgiveness at the sema for all the mistakes that they may make while wearing the sacred yellow cloth (these “mistakes” refer in general, to many of the 227 regulations to which strict adherence is virtually impossible). A Pali name, determined by the date of birth, is then given to all the new monks by the abbot. Special astrological books are used which indicate the letters auspicious for that day, month, and year.

During the remainder of the Lenten period, the monks congregate in the bod on holy days at 9:00 in the morning and at 4:00 in the afternoon. Though the monks in the bod have left the doors open, none of the laity is permitted to enter at these times. The abbot enters first and leaves last. All krab in front of the Buddha before taking their places. It is at this time that the pattimok, or 227 regulations, are rehearsed. At the end of the morning session, some of the monks may remain in the bod to meditate. Prior to the afternoon session, confessions are made. Outside the bod, in front of the sema, a junior monk confesses to the senior monk all his transgressions of the past two weeks. The sins are combined thus: “I have done many bad things these past days; I want to confess to you all these mistakes, both small and large, so that you may be a witness to my errors."" The senior monk replies that it is proper to have confessed and that one must be certain not to commit these sins again. The senior monk then confesses in like fashion to his junior. If the monks have quarreled during the past interval, they must apologize to one another following the confession.

One monk conducts services in the wihan for the laity. These services, held at 9:00 a.m. and at 7:30 p.m., consist of readings from the Trajpidok, dealing primarily with the attainment of merit and demerit. These sermons which last about one hour, are written on palmleaf and are known as sermon books or nangsythed. The monk is free to choose his own story. Following the reading, the monk counts the money given by the laity for the reading and announces the amount publicly.

Sometimes during the first two weeks of Lent (always on a Thursday), the monks who were ordained by the same Upacha during the year will pay their respects to him at his own wat, in a ritual similar in meaning to the wajkhru. Each group of monks is escorted by its abbot, on a day chosen by the Upacha, so that all the monks whom he has ordained that year may come at the same time. Each monk carries a khryangbucha. When they arrive at the wihan, the candles and joss-sticks are lit and held in the waj position as the monks chant an apology to the Upacha for all the sins and mistakes which they may make during the ensuing Lenten period. The Upacha forgives them and encourages them not to make mistakes. He then recites for them a lesson from the Buddhist scriptures, and the ceremony ends.

The last day of the Lenten period is referred to as Wanaugphansa or “day of leaving the Phansa.” It is not necessary to leave on that particular day, and temporary monks sometimes stay a week or so longer. Though the particular day upon which the novice enters the monkhood, i.e., the day of ordination, is determined by the availability of the Upacha, the day upon which he leaves the monkhood must be an auspicious day. The abbot, consulted in advance, advises the proper date.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual267,Kathin Ceremony,"Thaud Kathin: This is the first post-Lenten festival and is one of the largest and gayest. Though most major wat ceremonies fall on the 15th day of the waxing or waning moon—holy days, Thaud Kathin takes place between mid-October and mid-November, and is generally on a Sunday so that it may be attended by the urban business laymen. (Sunday is a business holiday, a Western adaptation.) Thaud Kathin literally means to lay down a wooden frame on which to stretch cloth. In former times this was the method by which monks' clothing was made. Pieces of rags would be stretched across a frame, sewn together, and then dyed. Today, monks' clothing comes in 15 sections already dyed and stitched together.

The Kathin may be sponsored by a single wealthy person (often from an urban area), or it may be the joint undertaking of several well-to-do families, or members of an industrial firm, or perhaps a group of 20 or more villagers may sponsor the Kathin. With the exception of the urban areas, it is not the custom to sponsor a Kathin in one's own community, for in such a case less merit is received.The method of sponsoring a Kathin is as follows: the sponsor or sponsors decide to Kathin at a certain wat. A wat is bespoken and a day reserved. Once booked, it may not accept another sponsor, being permitted only one a year. A wat that is already spoken for hoists a tall flagpole upon which is flown the Kathin flag showing that the wat already has a sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to obtain the number of regular monks residing at that wat in order to determine the quantity of gifts to be brought.

In 1947, 50 members of the Bangkhuad community pooled resources and sponsored a Kathin at a wat some 25 miles distant from their own. A sum of twenty-five hundred baht was collected by the group and a wealthy household from a nearby hamlet contributed another 1500 baht. They brought food and a bathing cloth for each of the 23 monks and a set of clothing (phatraj) for the abbot. This latter is a sine qua non of all Kathins. In addition, the usual Kathin assortment of candles, joss-sticks, tea, carpentry tools, and notebooks was given to the wat.

It is customary for the small rural villages to wait until the last minute to sponsor a Kathin in order to give the large business firms first choice. All wats, for purely mercenary reasons, prefer to be sponsored by a large firm, rather than by a poor village, the cash value of the Kathin usually being from three to ten times greater with the former group. It is the general consensus of the Bangkhuad farmers that if 4000 baht cannot be raised, it is not worth sponsoring a Kathin. The Bombay-Burma Company of Bangkok (a British business firm) which sponsored the Kathin in 1953 in Bangkhuad, donated 20,000 baht in addition to the regular clothing, tools, and food.

The night prior to the Kathin, several of the more well-to-do households each invite four of five monks to their homes to suadmonjen(evening blessing). Friends and relatives will be invited for a repast, and whiskey is consumed in large quantities. The following morning, the same monks are invited for breakfast.

News spreads rapidly when a wat is holding a Kathin, and farmers from miles around begin to arrive at about 10:00 a.m.—a steady stream of people zig-zagging in single file across the paddy fields, colorfully dressed, many of them carrying umbrellas to protect them from the sun. Many come by boat, and the canal rings with shouting and drumming. The Kathin is no doubt the noisiest and the gayest of all wat festivals and although the actual presentation of the Kathin is held in the afternoon, festivities begin in the late morning.

The larger, heavier containers of gifts and sometimes food, arrive by boat. It is known as the Kathin boat and is adorned with flags and paper decorations. It is usually propelled by a motor and tows several other boats laden with people yelling, ho-ing, and beating drums, cymbals, and tin pans.

All morning, a dozen or more women are busy in the wat cooking great quantities of fancy food for the sponsors, their guests, and the monks. (The villagers of the community are responsible for supplying the food, although the sponsors make a monetary contribution to defray the cost, and other guests bring varying quantities of food).

The monks, in the meantime, having recited the Phatimok in the bod, return to their cubicles, while the abbot remains in the wihan to talk with the visiting sponsors.

At this point a Malay-drum orchestra (similar to the one used for escorting the nag to the wat during the pre-ordination ritual) begins the procession which circles the bod three times. In the procession are always four or five individuals dressed in bright clothing, their faces smeared with rouge and powder, who act as leaders in the ecstatic trance-like dancing. (They are usually men and older women.) In 1953, there was also a Chinese dragon called Singto (lion) by the Thai. This dragon consists of a huge, brightly-colored papiermaché head, under which several male villagers take turns walking and cavorting. The body consists simply of a long red cloth which three or four persons hold over their heads. By weaving about, the impression is given of a writhing dragon. Two assistants dance in front of the dragon. One wears a pig-face mask and carries a trident, the other is dressed as a Chinese mythological character and carries a lighted torch. The man wearing the large dragon head takes a mouthful of kerosene and spits it through the dragon's mouth. As he does so, the Chinese character applies the torch and a jet of flame shoots through the air, giving the dragon a very realistic appearance, much to the amusement of the on-lookers. Men manipulating the dragon-head are changed frequently, for the dance is quite strenuous, and the head is heavy.

With each round of the bod, the drumming grows louder and the dancing more ecstatic. Members of the village who have joined the procession also take part in the ecstatic dancing.

The group now proceeds to the wihan, where at 11:00, the monks are fed. When the monks have finished and recited the hajphaun blessing, the sponsor and his guests (village headmen, head school teachers, and other influential villagers, besides relatives and personal friends of the sponsor) begin their meal, sitting within the wihan and on the porches of the khuti.

Meanwhile, the rest of the villagers eat at home, or at one of the many food stalls which have been set up for the occasion.

The Kathin ceremony begins at 2:00, with the procession again circling the bod. This time, however, the monks join the procession, along with the sponsors who carry the Kathin gifts. Once in the wihan, the monks take their places on the dais.

The sponsor krabs before the abbot and asks (khausin) for the eight Buddhist laws. He holds out the three robes and says in Pali, “I am offering this cloth to the monks of this wat. Please accept it, and may it be of use to you and bring you happiness for all times.” He then places the robes between the khusuad and the abbot. The following part of the ceremony is known as the krankathin, or “the spreading out of the Kathin.” The abbot answers, saying, “These robes are a very special gift and so must be kept here to be used by all monks and by no one monk in particular.” The senior of the two khusuad then suggests that it is only appropriate that these robes be given to the abbot, for he is the only one in the congregation who possesses the required qualifications: proper knowledge, proper spirit, and proper actions. “If any monk,” he continues, “has any objections to this suggestion, let him speak.” All the monks say “ Sathu,” expressing their approval. The senior khusuad then announces that the monks are unanimous (unanimity is a requisite for all major actions within the wat) in their decision to let the abbot be given the cloth, for he is deserving and wise. The cloth is offered to him by the khusuad. The abbot retires to the bod, changes into the new phatrajand returns. He leads the saphi-chant of thanks, followed by a chant in which the monks say to the laity, “May those who know the proper time to Kathin receive great merit, and may they also receive health, prosperity, and long life.”

During the blessing chant, a cord of holy string is unravelled and passed hand to hand, from the monks to members of the laity sitting near the dais. The end is wrapped three times around the Buddha image. The cord is held between the palms of the hand. Following the chant, the laity ask the abbot to relate the story of the Kathin. After the story, the abbot announces to the monks that the Kathin is officially over and that they should be happy and grateful to have been witnesses to so wonderful a ceremony, for now they are entitled to the five privileges: 1) they may leave the wat premises without having to wear all of the three cloths; 2) they may leave the wat premises without having first to obtain permission of the abbot; 3) they may own and wear more than one set of clothing; 4) they may accept the gifts offered to them at this Kathin; and 5) they may eat in groups (the regulation of eating alone during Lent is not enforced in Bangkhuad).

It must be realized that only from 80 to 100 members of the community witness the actual Kathin ceremony. The great majority of the villagers remain outside watching the various forms of entertainment, such as the wooden sword duelling (fandab), the liké, and the boat racing. Boat racing is highly amusing, and is participated in by the younger male members of the community. The long, narrow boats (rented for the occasion by the sponsor) hold 12 paddlers who climb into the boats fully dressed (including shoes and watches). They race for a distance of 50 meters only, but due to the narrow width of the canal and the disorganized paddling, they frequently bump into one another and overturn, much to the delight of the onlookers.",0,1,0,0,1,1
Ritual268,Phapa Ceremony,"Phapa: The Phapa ceremonies occur from the end of Lent until the harvest season. In 1953, Wat Banghuad received three Phapas. In contrast to all other ceremonies and rituals, the Phapa is the one occasion where the laity take it upon themselves to remind the monks to purify their thoughts, to remember that material things are only of this world, and that greed and desire must be eliminated.

The tradition behind the Phapa, as related by several members of the village, is this: In the days when the Buddha was preaching, cloth was very scarce. The monks used only such clothing as could be found on the bodies of the dead. The people removed the dead man's clothing, and put it on a clay image which was thrown into the jungle, but close enough to the paths traversed by the monks to be in full sight. When a monk passed one of these figures, he knew that the clothing was a gift for himself, and gratefully made use of it.

Today, the villagers simulate the legend by cutting a branch from a tree, tying a small cotton gibbon to one of the lesser branches, and some yellow cloth, money, medicine, notebooks, and matches on the other branches. This is then stuck into the ground near the wihan. On the ground about the base of the branch are placed bunches of bananas and other fruits, young coconuts, joss-sticks, and candles.

It is usually the older members of a community who sponsor a Phapa, for they are eager to acquire as much merit as possible before they die. A group of five to ten individuals buys the various materials for Phapa and set out by boat. The boats are decorated with paper flags, streamers, and bananas, so that everyone will know that a Phapa is being taken to some wat. A Phapa may be offered to several wats along the way, but the Phapa, as is the case with the Kathin, is seldom given to the wat in one's own community.

There are two methods of announcing the arrival of a Phapa to a wat. The less common is to set off a series of firecrackers and then scurry away. This method permits any monk or monks to claim the Phapa. The second and more common method is to approach the wat very quietly and send one member of the group to the abbot, informing him that there is a Phapa. If they desire a particular monk to share it, they mention his name. If not, the about is asked to choose one or two other monks to join him in receiving the gifts.

When the messenger returns, the donors kneel in front of the Phapa, recite a blessing, and then retire. The abbot arrives with another monk (or two), touches the cloth, and recites a blessing. Only the cloth is touched or looked upon. This, to demonstrate that the monks are not interested in material things. The donors may then approach and ask the monk to offer them a blessing. Following this little ceremony, they often spend a few minutes chatting and exchanging village news with the monks. The monks then return to the wat with the branch; the people depart, and a few minutes later, the dekwat are sent to collect the food gifts. These are divided among the abbot and the intended monks, the junior monks receiving the larger share.

Following the Phapa season, the harvest begins, and for two months there are no more ceremonies.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual269,Makhabucha Ceremony,"Makhabucha: The next Buddhist ceremony occurs on the 15th day of the waxing moon of the third month (February), and is known as Makhabucha (see Glossary).

Starting at 9:00 a.m., the monks, in turn, read from four different Buddhist texts, each of one-half hour's duration. At 11:00 they are fed by the laity, and until 1:00 they rest. At 1:00, another series of four readings begins. Sometimes there is an orchestra (piphat) which plays between the readings. In 1953 and 1954, there was no orchestra, since all money was being put away for the proposed new sala. Since the Makhabucha, as is true of nearly all wat-laity ceremonies, is primarily a service for the laymen, the presence of all the monks is not deemed necessary and so they remain in seclusion during the readings.

For all the thed read at these special ceremonies, the reader sits on a large red-lacquered chair-throne in katsamad position. A small table upon which are a pitcher of tea, some cups, a few bottles of Coca-cola, and a spitoon, is placed next to the chair.

It is customary at Wat Bangkhuad to have the abbot on such occasions read the first and last stories. The readings all concern various episodes from the life of the Buddha. Inevitably, the abbot is asked to recount in addition, the story of the origin of the Makhabucha. As the legend goes, 1250 monks from all parts of India, without previous notification, appeared simultaneously before the Buddha and requested that he convey to them the regulations that they must follow. The Buddha proceeded to relate to them the 227 laws known as the Phatimok.

Prior to each of the readings, the laity place lighted joss-sticks in a sand-filled jar and lighted candles are placed around the rim. At the termination of each reading, small gifts of fruit, tea, cigarettes, salted meat and fish, onions, peppers, kerosene, etc., are laid at the feet of the reader. Money is placed in a special bowl. The average cash donation, per lecture, on these occasions is 10 baht. The money collects in the bowl and is taken by the abbot at the end of the day. He divides it among the other monks who have read. Edible gifts are divided among all the monks.

On the second day of Makhabucha, since other functions are going on simultaneously outside the wihan, there is only one reading in the morning, and three in the afternoon. In 1952, 1953, and 1954, the two rituals of putting gold leaf on the Buddha footprint and building a rice pagoda occurred on this second day. These rituals need not necessarily be held on the same day, or during the Makhabucha ceremony. But during these years, they were held on the same day as a matter of expediency. The logic is that the more activities that can be offered to the laity, the larger the attendance is likely to be, and the more money and gifts are likely to be contributed to the wat. In 1950 and 1951, the gold leaf and rice pagoda rituals were held at different times. The intake then, compared with ensuing years, was 10 and 25 per cent less, respectively.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual270,Rice Pagoda Ritual (Khawphrasajkhawphlyag),"The Rice Pagoda Ritual (Khawphrasajkhawphlyag): This ritual, involving the construction of a rice pagoda, is always held in the third lunar month (February) for a practical reason. The harvesting has just been completed and the farmer finds himself with more rice on hand than at any other time of the year.

In 1954, over 130 individuals, representing as many households (some from other villages) brought a total of 154 tang of paddy rice. In front of the bod an area 20' by 20' was fenced off (against animals). Yellow and red flags were placed on tall bamboo poles in each corner to mark, as well as to decorate, the area.

Each farmer, as he pours his rice on the pile, offers a short prayer in Pali or Thai. Holding lighted joss-sticks and squatting in waj position, he says, “I bring this rice to you, O Buddha, in order to make the pile very high. Please grant me a crop for the coming year that is as good as the one this year.” He then sticks a small triangular red, yellow, or green paper flag into the pile.

That evening, or the following day, the dekwat gather the rice, storing most of it in the bod and the remainder in the wat bins. This paddy rice is eventually sold to a Chinese middleman and the proceeds are used for the maintainance of the wat, or for whatever the wat committee decides is necessary.

During the afternoon, the great majority of visitors and villagers mill about, chatting, eating, and drinking at the various food and soft drink stalls. They may wander into the wihan from time to time, listen to a part of the sermon, and wander out again. There will be only 25 or so older members of the community who stay in the wihan and listen to an entire sermon, and only half a dozen who remain for a complete morning and afternoon session. This over-all behavior pattern is typical at all large religious ceremonies.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual271,Wissakhabucha Ceremony,"Wissakhabucha: Wissakhabucha is celebrated on the 15th day of the waxing moon of the sixth lunar month (May). It is the last Buddhist ceremony prior to Lent, and perhaps the most important insofar as the people are concerned. It commemorates the last reincarnation, – the death and ascent of Buddha into Nirvana.

The monks on this day eat only the morning meal, and many of the laity follow their example. Since there is no noon meal, the readings begin at 11:00 a.m. and continue until 12:30 a.m. the following morning. This reading marathon concerns the 33 lessons dealing with the life cycle of the Buddha. Inasmuch as only four monks can read well, they must each read a total of four hours, half an hour at a time.

The sub-ceremony is of Brahman origin and is known as Wiantian (circling candles). It takes place at 7:30 p.m. of the same day. Each member who joins the procession carries a khryangbucha. The abbot leads the group three times around the bod, followed by the other monks (in order of seniority), and the laymen. As they circumambulate, they recite a Pali blessing to the Buddha, in which he is thanked for all the things he has taught them. After the third turn, the candles are placed in the small niches of the various sema. The joss-sticks are placed in a receptacle inside the bod. Before entering, the men and women place a shawl or phakhawma across their left shoulders as a gesture of reverence to the Lord Buddha. There are two more readings within the bod.

The group then returns to the wihan, and after all have partaken of some tea or soft drinks, the readings continue. As is true on all holy days, donations are made after each story. The dozen or so members of the laity who stay until the very end of the readings usually sleep that night in the wihan.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Ritual273,Special Ritual of the Wat Artist,"Special Ritual of the Wat Artist: The wat artist, each time he finishes a set of decorations to be used for the crematory, performs a small ritual. He lights joss-sticks and a candle, then sprinkles holy water (which he has made) on his hair, his face and hands, on the joss-sticks, and finally over the art work itself. This ritual is done to drive off the evil spirits which associate themselves with cremations and death.

An individual who has had a series of misfortunes in business, in his family, or in his rice fields, may ask the abbot to have some magic Pali symbols painted into a piece of cloth or banner, which he has brought along. This banner or cloth will be hung in the doorway of his home or place of business. Though the request may occur at any time of the year, it is more common to bring the cloth to the wat just prior to the Lenten period and leave it there for the three months of Lent. It is believed that this bestows on the cloth a stronger magical potency.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Ritual274,Housewarming Ritual,"Housewarming Ritual ( Khynbanmaj): Upon completion of the new house, and before anyone may enter, there is another ritual known as the housewarming. When the staircase of the new house has been completed (it being the last item to be constructed), it is blocked off with a rattan cord. No one is permitted to ascend. The abbot is consulted as to the auspicious hour for the ritual which always takes place on a Friday. On Thursday evening, five monks (or more) are invited to suadmonjen. Joss-sticks and candles are lighted, and the holy string is unwound and passed around the house as in the housepost ritual. The rattan barrier on the staircase is broken by the abbot who then recites a short blessing before ascending. The other monks and members of the household follow him up the stairs. The guests remain below. Following the blessing chant, which takes place in the main room, the monks return to the wat. The guests are then served a sumptuous meal and rice whiskey. No one is yet permitted to sleep in the house.

The following morning the monks and guests are invited for breakfast, after which the monks recite the hajphaun blessing. Following the blessing, the abbot dips a palm leaf into a bowl of holy water and sprinkles the various rooms, the roof, the walls, and the ground around the house, chanting in Pali as he does so. The guests are now free to enter the house, and the members of the household may take up residence there.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual275,Floating Leafcup (Lojkrathong),"Lojkrathong (Floating Leafcup): This festival is for the entire community and employs the clergy only briefly. The krathong is held at the end of the rainy season on the 15th day of the waxing moon in the 12th lunar month (November).

According to the Bangkhuad farmer, the purpose of the krathong is two-fold: it is a tribute paid to the thewada of the river called Phramaekhongkha, and also a tribute to the snake, Phrajanag, who resides at the bottom of the canal. The legend states that Phrajanag literally followed in the Buddha's footsteps and succeeded in reaching Nirvana.

In the morning, all the households are busily preparing their krathongs. The trunk of the banana tree is cut, transversely, into one inch slices. These serve as the hulls or bases of the krathong. The banana leaf is cut into strips, folded in various ways, and attached to the sides of the base in such a way as to resemble birds, boats, or lotus plants. Inside the krathong are placed flowers, joss sticks, candles, popcorn, and money—one satang for each year of age of the maker. Some farmers also place a small mud snake inside.

The festival starts in the early evening. Since it is a holy day, many of the elders have already gathered at the wihan. The other members of the village gather there at 6:00, each with at least one krathong and many with two or more. Five monks perform a special chant called Mahachad, which depicts the story of the king who gave away his rain-producing elephant and went into exile, thus causing the rains to cease. The legend (mentioned above) of Phrajanag is also related.

At 9:00 p. m., the entire group goes down to the canal. The candles in the krathong are lighted, and the little floats are placed in the water and allowed to drift with the current. As they are released, each person offers a prayer, directed to the Goddess of the River, Maekhongkha, and to the King of the Snakes, Phrajanag: “I send with you all my sins and sicknesses that have appeared this year. May you not return to me the following year, but may you bring me health and wealth.” Some farmers may ask for a lucky lottery ticket.

From midnight until 12:30 a. m., when the full moon is directly overhead, the canal water is believed to be holy. At this time, the elders of the village go down to the river and bathe. They return with small bowls filled with the holy water and place them in front of their home altars. This water will be used on special occasions. involving the monks in any of the house rituals.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual276,Thamkhwanjung,"Thamkhwanjung or Rabkhwanjung: These are titles used when calling the spirit of the Rice Goddess ( Maephosob) into the house, a ritual that always takes place in an even-numbered month, after the threshing has been completed. It must occur before the paddy can be placed in the storage bins or sold to the Chinese. As with the chalew (see Page 206), an elderly female member of the household performs the ritual. She goes out into the field which offered the best yield, taking with her a large white cloth, a small colored cloth, three khryangbucha, and several small colored flags. In the field, she makes a small doll out of rice stubble. The joss-sticks and candles are lit and placed in the ground. The doll is wrapped in the small colored cloth. Maephosob is then invoked to attend the ritual. The incantation used, in rough abridged translation, is:

Part I. We pay homage to you, Goddess of the Fields, mistress of the paddy, jungles, and rivers; we beg you to attend this ritual and to protect us from all kinds of evil and misfortune. Please come and accept our offerings. ( Ho-ing) Part II. Hail to you … etc. … mother of the earth, the rice and all things that grow. We invite you to come to our bins – please forgive us for cutting you with our sickles, for carrying you to our house, for threshing you unmercifully. Do not run away, do not be frightened, but be gracious and come to visit us in our granaries.

The entire incantation lasts 50 minutes. A shorter, alternative version goes:

Maephosob, you are as beautiful as a star. Please come to our rice bin, please come out of the rain and the hot sun, come and rest in our shade.

The doll is then placed in the basket along with some loose paddy collected from the field. The large white cloth is wrapped around the saraeg (see illustration, Appendix), and all is carried back to the threshing grounds, where some grain from the threshing floor is now poured into the basket.

Meanwhile, the paddy rice has been piled into a large pyramid. Some member of the family has placed, at the base of the storage bins, a young coconut, bean cakes, and a bajsi with a hard-boiled egg (symbol of fertility and life) on top. Some fruit, hair oil, powder, betel, areca palm leaf, lime paste, and a comb have been placed on a large tray and set on the ground next to the bin.

At this time, the men of the household are permitted to participate in the ritual. The woman performing the ritual places the straw doll on top of the rice pyramid. The grain in the basket is thrown over the doll and the flags are placed at various intervals over the pyramid.The special foods are placed at the base. A young female member of the household has been selected to call or invite Maephosob to partake of the food offering. Joss-sticks and candles are lit and everyone retires to another part of the house until the joss-sticks have burned out, giving Maephosob time to partake of her meal. The children are sent in to collect the trays of food and offerings and to bid Maephosob goodbye. They rush in and happily say, “Goodbye, you have had your fill, so leave us as we eat the rest.”

The paddy rice may now be sold at any time without further ceremony. After it is placed in the bins, however, another ritual is required before it can be removed.

The proper day (never a Friday) for this ritual must be determined by an astrologer. In contrast to the preceding ritual, this one is performed by two male members of the family. A khryangbucha and a bowl are placed on top of the rice in the bin, and flags are placed at various intervals. Maephosob is thanked for all the rice with which she has provided them and is asked to provide them with a similar amount the following year. The small bowl is then filled with paddy rice and placed in front of the Buddhist altar. Rice from this bowl will be dispersed over all the fields during the next planting.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual277,Rain-Making Ritual,"Rain-making Ritual: If the rains have not arrived by the beginning of the eighth lunar month (July), the villagers may perform a rain-making ritual. The last such ritual occurred in 1949. Five monks are asked to recite a blessing in the paddy fields. They are given only dry foods to eat and no liquids to drink. The purpose is to torment the monks to the extent that the thewada of rain will take compassion on them. The monks repeat the chanting morning and afternoon for three days, returning to the wat only in the evening. In the wat they are still not permitted liquids or wet foods. On the fourth day, they are served a lavish meal for both breakfast and lunch. In the afternoon, the laity form a procession led by one member dressed as a large female cat. Hence the name of this procession— Haenangmaew. They go from house to house collecting donations of money for the monks who participated in the three-day ritual.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual278,Wâajkhruu Ceremony,"When a young man has decided upon a certain 'aacaan sàg, he must approach this ritual specialist with proper deference in order to make an appointment for the first session of tattooing. Often the 'aacaan sàg will decide that a Tuesday or a Saturday is the most appropriate because reputedly on such days of the week the ‘spirits are strong’. On the appointed day, the young man must come to the house of the tattooer, carrying a candle, some flowers and the fee. Payment for these types of magical services should traditionally be connected with the number six. Older people remember the days when they used to pay six [unknown], which is equivalent to 1 ½ baht, but nowadays the fee is often six baht or a plural number of six baht. The young boy should kneel down with his face towards the east, light the candle and incense and offer them together with the flowers to the ‘teachers’, those who in the dim past handed down the knowledge of tattooing. This ceremony is called wâajkhruu, and is also performed by the 'aacaan sàg. It is a common ritual also among Thai actors, dancers, musicians and boxers. 

After the wâajkhruu, when respect has been paid to the original possessors of the knowledge used, the 'aacaan sàg begins to make the tattoo. He employs a wooden shaft with a sharp metal tip which can contain a small quantity of ink. The tattooer guides the instrument over thumb and index finger of the left hand on to the skin of the young man, making rhythmical, powerful strokes in order to pierce the skin, pausing often to refill with ink. The person who undergoes this treatment should not cry out in pain, lest he be the laughing-stock of all who have suffered stoically. One design, covering maybe twelve square inches of skin, is usually sufficient for the first session; if the man still wishes to receive other designs he should wait a few days until the swelling of the recently tattooed skin subsides a little.

While he is being tattooed, a man is sometimes advised to repeat a short spell such as: ‘ehi ehi samm[unavailable]’, which can be translated as: ‘o come, come properly’. It is probable that such formulae are meant to make the recipient open to receive magical qualities together with the designs. The 'aacaan sàg himself murmurs formulae continuously. After finishing a design, the tattooer says a final spell while rubbing his fingers in the mixture of blood and ink that wells up from the recently tattooed skin, and terminates the session by blowing with all his might upon the design.

After a man has received as many tattoos as he wishes, a process which may last several weeks, because of the intermittent periods without tattooing, he must undergo a final effecting ritual. This ceremony is generally known as jóg khruu, literally: ‘to raise the teacher’. This ritual can take place in a monastery, near a Buddha image, sometimes in the most sacred place: on the monks' platform in the bòod. The scene of the ceremony has been made attractive to the non-human powers by the offering of foods that these powers reputedly like: a pig's head, eggs, sweetmeats, candles, incense and flowers. When the powers have been invoked, the 'aacaan sàg will cause them to enter the body of the recently tattooed young person by perfunctorily piercing the skin on top of the skull several times with his tattooing needle.",0,,0,0,0,0

Ritual280,The Rite of Topknot Cutting,"The Rite of Topknot Cutting

The traditional rite of passage to be described is called kon phom ju(k), in which the topknot that was left unshaven at the stage of (ii) is cut. Though Kaufman takes the entrance to an elementary school as the rite after (i) and (ii), and this rite (i.e. topknot cutting) as the forth stage (or rite), the rite of topknot cutting referred to here will be taken as the third stage of the traditional rites of passage for the reason that the entrance to an elementary school can be regarded as a rite of passage taken quite recently. According to Kaufman, the rite of topknot cutting is held at the age of nine, eleven or thirteen, but here in Bang Khem the rite is closely related to the entrance to an elementary school, therefore the rite is usually held before the entrance. We could observe this rite directly since the rite for our cook's (or maid's) eldest son was performed with the entrance near at hand. The rite based on the observation is described as follows. The rite was performed on January 3 in 1971. The day was determined by a priest) in consideration of the convenience of the family. At 10:30 on that day, ten A priests, a school master and his wife, relatives, neighbours and friends of the mother (i.e. our maid) were invited. 26 people took part in the rite. The school master, a distant relative, who lives in the neighborhood and serves as the school master of the school in which they should enter the child. In addition, five of us and our two Thai assistants were permitted specially to take part in the rite. At 10:40 the mother lit candles in front of the Buddhist image(s) and altar(s) carried from the temple for the rite. Chanting a sutra, the priests pull the cotton thread from the Buddhist image(s) inside the room, and hang it on the child's neck for whom the rite is performed. With the man, a cousin of the mother (i.e. the child's mother's father's elder sister's child) as the chairman, the rite is performed. His father is a way from home for some reason. At first there is the chairman's greeting, then chanting sutras by nine priests for ten minutes. At 11:05, the child in white is put in silver chains and the topknot is untied (or cut). At 11:10, the chief priest pours the “lustral water” on the head of the child and cuts the topknot with scissors. Afterwards, the school master shaves the topknot with a razor. And the mother does the same thing after him. A teacher or priest helps them to shave. After the shaving, participants give some money to the child as the present of the ceremony. At 11:15, luncheon is served to the priests. At 11:50, they finish eating. Then, they chant a sutra for five minutes. The ceremony ends with the chairman's speech. Afterwards, luncheon are served to the other participants.

It must be noted here that they put the hair (cut during the rite) in the hole of a great linden tree in the precincts of a temple. This is because parents expect their child to grow in high spirits, and vigorously like a linden tree. Usually this rite is said to reflect the transition from infancy, boyhood to adolescence. The same is true of Bang Khem, in which the rite seems to be regarded as the preparation for the entrance to an elementary school. According to an old man, about this age they began to help their parents to farm and to keep a buffalo. Therefore the rite of topknot cutting might have served as an important stage to interest children in agriculture, in other words to make a farmer. If so, from the social cultural viewpoint it seems likely that by the rite of topknot cutting is meant the transition of the children to adolescence. Today children scarcely tie the topknots, and this rite is not significant for them. Rather the entrance to an elementary school is important for them in the history of their lives. The entrance to an elementary school is taking the place of traditional rites like this. Therefore the rite of topknot cutting could not be regarded as the rite of passage having the same value as the entrance to an elementary school does. Needless to say, before an elementary school was systematized quite recently in Thai culture, the rite of topknot cutting had played an very important role in indicating the stages of growth.)

Ritual281,Wajkhru,"Wajkhru Ritual

Wajkhru serves functionally a double role. Primarily it represents a reverence paid to the abstractions—“the teacher and learning,”—to the spirit of teaching and knowledge; to all the teachers in the scholastic fields, as well as to one's particular teacher. Secondly, it functions in a sense as “opening day.” For until the ceremony is held, the teacher is theoretically not permitted to divulge any information that he has learned from another teacher.

Wajkhru Day is always on a Thursday, usually the first one in June. In many schools, the ritual is preceded by a prayer chanted by a group of monks who have been invited to bless the school and the students. In Bangkhuad, this part of the ceremony is neglected. At nine A.M. the children assemble in the reading-office room of the school. Each child brings joss-sticks, candle, eggplant flower, pop-rice, and grass. The last item symbolizes wisdom, which, it is hoped, will grow as easily and as rapidly. A student who has been the leader in the pratom four recitations is designated to act as leader in the ceremony. He gathers a large bunch of flowers, joss-sticks, and candles from various students. This is called the khryang bucha. These are placed upon a special altar erected for this purpose. The altar consists of a simple school table upon which a cloth is laid. A small Buddha is placed on the cloth with two jars on his left for joss-sticks and two on his right for flowers. According to regulations, there should be a small orchestra to accompany the ceremony, but the head teacher asserts that the school cannot afford it. The leader of each class carries up a set of books used by the class and places it on the altar. The students sit on the floor in waj position, with the youngest students in front and the oldest students in back. The teachers sit on chairs on both sides of the altar, facing the students. The head teacher stands up, lights the joss-sticks and candles on the table, and begins to recite the Arahangsama. This, in rough translation, is as follows: “I pay respect to the teachings of the Lord Buddha. I pay respect to the monks, the followers of Buddha…” The head teacher then blows out the candles, picks up a set of the books from the altar, and makes the three magic dots on a book ( cymnangsy) with one of the candles. The purpose is to bestow upon the students a greater power for absorbing knowledge. The candle is then dipped into a special perfumed powder ( paengkacae) and the sign of the unalom [unknown] is made on the book. This is repeated with the represented books from the other three classes. Any student who so desires may also have the unalom sign or the cym (three dots) painted on his forehead by the head teacher. The cym is made by dipping the thumb, index, and middle fingers in the paste and applying it to the forehead.

The only other school ceremony is the Closing Day Ritual which takes place on the next-to-last or third-to-last day of school. Each student brings food for the monks who have been invited to give a prayer of blessing ( suadmon). Following the blessing, the monks eat. When they have finished, the students eat the remaining food. One of the monks relates a short story about the Buddha, and the ritual ends.

Discipline in the school is rigid but not severe. The children enjoy receiving an education and the opportunity to be in a large social context with other children their own age. Among the teachers, however, morale is low. Classes are over-crowded; there is a paucity of necessary equipment such as chalk, maps, books, etc. What books there are are poorly written and dull for both the teacher and the pupil. Male teachers may not converse with women teachers except on school matters.

All the teachers are aware of the new ECAFE experimental teaching project at Chachingsaw and look to the results of this project as the panacea for all these problems. The Ministry of Education has led them to believe that it will revolutionize all teaching methods throughout the nation.

Another reason for low morale, perhaps the most important, concerns the lack of rapport between the head teacher and the other four teachers. The head teacher is of Lao origin which has caused his subordinates to look upon him with slight suspicion. The relationship between the head teacher and the abbot is anything but amicable—a situation which does not add to the head teacher's popularity among the villagers.

In 1950, the head teacher asked all pupils to have their parents contribute one tang of rice to the school in order to construct a playground (the rice would be sold with the proceeds being used to pay the laborers). About 80 tang (worth about 650 baht) were donated and later sold by the head teacher. Work on the field was postponed, however, because of harvesting, several cremations, and a six-week illness of the head teacher. By this time, the rains had set in and the project was postponed indefinitely. The head teacher insisted that the money meanwhile had been stolen, but others in the village asserted that he spent it. As a result, he now receives only minimal support when donations are needed.

Here is a brief sketch of each of the five teachers and the janitor.

The head school teacher is 50 years old. Married, he has three children but no rice fields. He serves both as teacher and administrator, though the latter duties are at a minimum. He was born and educated in Khorad (northeast Thailand), where he completed the first year of secondary school. He then joined the monkhood, where he remained for thirteen years. His clerical rank was nagthamtho (ecclesiastical examination level two), the equivalent of secondary education level three. He came to Bangkhuad in 1934, when the school was officially opened, and immediately assumed the responsibility of head teacher. In addition to his daily duties, the head teacher also teaches the monks in the evening.

As a matter of prestige only, he would like to take the paupau examination, which qualifies one for secondary school teaching, but is afraid that he would lose too much face should he not pass. He now dislikes the responsibility of being head teacher. He dislikes supervising the other teachers and pupils as well as attending the monthly meetings at the district office. He is opposed to the idea of building a secondary school, inasmuch as this would entail even more responsibility on his part.

In addition to teaching, he practices medisine of the “old-fashioned” type ( mauboran). He is one of the few who raises mushrooms. He sends his three daughters to school in Bangkok. His wife earns 600 baht a month as a seamstress; his own salary is 700 baht per month.

Teacher A, born in Bangkhuad, is 36 years old, married, has one child, and lives with his parents who own 100 raj. He has had three years of secondary education in Bangkok. He was offered a teaching job at Bangkhuad, interrupted his education to accept it, and considers it too late now to return to school. A subscribes to a magazine on fowl-breeding and a Bangkok newspaper. After school, he helps his parents with household duties, works in their fields during the plowing, planting, harvesting, etc. His salary is 550 baht.

Teacher B, born in Tonburi, is 30 years old, married, has two children, owns a store and five raj. He learned of the job through a cousin in Bangkok. He has had four years of secondary school education. He attended teachers' training school but found commuting too tiring; then took a correspondence course through the auspices of the YMCA, but mail was frequently lost. His monthly salary is 575, his rent is ten, and his food 300 baht.

Teacher C, 23 years old, was born at Khalasin. At the time of his transfer to Bangkhuad in 1952 he was not married. Subsequently, he was forced by social pressure to marry his neighbor's daughter in order to remain in the community. He has had six years of secondary school, and worked for a construction company for several years but left when his overseer tried to get him to take the blame for some alleged corruption. He was offered his present teaching position by a relative and accepted with the intention of leaving after a year or two. He is now preparing for the paupau examination. His salary is 550 baht per month.

Teacher D, 32 years old, is the only woman teacher in the community. She was born in Bangkhuad, is married and has two children. Her husband drives a truck and commutes from Bangkok, where he has another wife. Teacher D lives with her parents three kilometres from the school and paddles with her daughter to and from school (one hour each way). She completed pratom six and wanted to study in Bangkok, but women were not permitted to travel alone and education for them was discouraged. She had not planned to teach, but the head teacher insisted because of the teacher shortage. She practice-taught for one term under the guidance of the head teacher; at 15, she took the teaching examination at the district office, passed with a score of 98 per cent, and was given a salary of 12 baht. (Other women in the district were getting 10.) Today, she teaches singing and sewing to all classes, in addition to her regular teaching of class 2a; she commutes to Bangkok once a week, where she studies singing at the Sinlapakaun School of Music and Dance; in her spare time, she studies in the hope of passing the paupau examination next year. Her salary would then be automatically increased 25 per cent. Her present salary is 525 baht per month.

The janitor, 30 years old, is married and has one child. He rents five raj and helps his wife to work them. He received the job of janitor at the school through the head school teacher. His salary is 4020 baht a year. He sells cloth in his spare time and also hires out at 10 baht a day during the school vacations.

All the members of the community feel that education is a means and not an end. With an education one can leave the arduous task of farming and receive respectable employment in Bangkok—an office job with monthly income. As one farmer stated, “People who can read and write can't be cheated. They can manipulate figures and write wills; they can get non-farming jobs.”

For these reasons, secular education is an accepted and highly respected institution. The head teacher maintained that if a secondary school were built, there would be an 80 per cent potential enrollment from Bangkhuad alone. In the commune there are over 400 potential students. As mentioned before, the Ministry of Education promised to build a secondary school in 1957, but the school had not even been started by December, 1957, and the likelihood of this promise materializing in the near future is very slight. Most farmers want their children to have a secondary education, but cannot afford to send them away to school. However, a relatively large number of families do send their children to secondary school in either Minburi or Bangkok, where they have relatives with whom their children can stay. The cost of sending a child to school in Bangkok is 300 baht per year. If the child commutes, there is an additional 300 for carfare. In those cases where the child stays with relatives, the host is given rice for his entire family; this averages about 50 tang a year.

It is of interest to note that the wealthy families in Bangkhuad do not send their children to secondary school, considering that they have enough money as it is. Thus, it must be reiterated that, in Bangkhuad, education is not so much a source of prestige as a means to a more remunerative and easier existence than can be offered by farming.



Wajkhru Ritual: The wajkhru ritual is performed once every year by all teachers. The purpose is to offer thanks to the thewada of knowledge, to the first teacher, and to all subsequent teachers of a particular subject for having given them the knowledge which they have been able to pass on to others. The wajkhru for school teachers was described briefly in Chapter V. Following are descriptions of two different wajkhru rituals.

In March or April, and always on a Thursday, the abbot sponsors a wajkhru day. All persons, monks, as well as laymen who are indebted to the abbot for services rendered them during the past year, come to pay homage. The abbot asks one of the villagers to prepare two bajsi under which are placed two meters of white cloth. In addition, several members prepare a pig's head, its four feet, and the tail. These are put on a tray. There are also other trays containing bananas, 25 young coconuts, khryangbucha, a bowl of holy water, some perfume, and powder. On still another tray are placed whiskey, sliced chicken, and duck.

When everyone has gathered in the sala, the candles and joss-sticks are lighted. The abbot asks the spirit of knowledge to join the ritual ( chumnumthewada) and a chant of thanks and gratitude is then offered to the thewada, who is asked to accept the homage paid him by his pupils and to bring health and happiness and prosperity to all those participating in the ritual.

The pupils ( lugsid) then kneel before the abbot in single file according to age. The abbot mixes the perfumed oil and powder into a paste and places either the three dots ( cym), the unalom sign, or a magic Khmer sign on each forehead and recites a magic Pali formula. A kanmajom leaf is dipped into the bowl and the holy water is sprinkled over the pupil. When the last pupil has been blessed, the ritual ends. The food is later divided among the monks.

Special Ritual of the Wat Artist: The wat artist, each time he finishes a set of decorations to be used for the crematory, performs a small ritual. He lights joss-sticks and a candle, then sprinkles holy water (which he has made) on his hair, his face and hands, on the joss-sticks, and finally over the art work itself. This ritual is done to drive off the evil spirits which associate themselves with cremations and death.

An individual who has had a series of misfortunes in business, in his family, or in his rice fields, may ask the abbot to have some magic Pali symbols painted into a piece of cloth or banner, which he has brought along. This banner or cloth will be hung in the doorway of his home or place of business. Though the request may occur at any time of the year, it is more common to bring the cloth to the wat just prior to the Lenten period and leave it there for the three months of Lent. It is believed that this bestows on the cloth a stronger magical potency.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual282,"Pomblang Festival, Day 1 and 2","It is being held every year since the days of U Shillong who was supposed to be the founder of original Khyriem State. They celebrate it to perpetuate his memory and pay homage with a view to ensure rain, good harvest, eliminating diseases and famine. He was worshipped along with other ancestors with view to guide the present Chief in his discharge of his duties and for the welfare of the people.

The responsibility of performing this ritual rests on the High-priestess ( Ka Siem Sad ) who is succeeded by her eldest daughter. Different ritual objects are procured by her, well in advance and it is obligatory on her part to join the ceremonial dancing, in which her daughter may also officiate on her behalf. U Shillong is worshipped by the chief priest while the other ancestors are invoked by lesser priests. The musicians ( Dhulia ) besides their normal duties, take part in the worship of the ancestors and they are presented with silk turban, jacket, cloth, by the ruling family for the services rendered during the festival. The Siem has no especial role except to supervise and evoke U Shillong for the welfare of the community. He is required to perform certain sacrifices, failing which his heir-apparent ( Siem kynnah ) does the same. He along with his sister (High priestess) abstain from taking rice during the period of celebration presumably to observe the sanctity of this festival as also to ensure the successful conclusion of the function.

Ritual Materials

The festival derives its name from the sacrifice of a large number of goats some of which were supplied from the State fund and from different units of the territory. Formerly at least fifty goats were required and each unit had a specific allotment but owing to the cconomic difficulty that the Khasi are experiencing, the number of goats sacrificed hardly exceeds twenty-five. The goats collected from the different units, are presented to the Chief at the midnight of the third day. Rice-beer, dried fish, fermented-rice, betel leaves together with nuts are also important ritual objects in this celebration.

Description of the Festival

The commencement of the festival was marked by the distribution of dried, fish (suit dokha) to the persons assembled on the occasion, in the evening of Pamtiah ( i.e. 21st June, 1957). This was followed by the dropping of rice-beer by the Chief priest over the fire place of central hall known as Ka suit-ka shor in which no sacrifice was made except this libation of this liquor in the name of U Shillong, Ka Blei Long Siem and U Suidnia. Subsequently, the Chief musician (Dhulia) worshipped another dcity Ka Synchar, by holding a yellow cook in front of ritual offerings collected on a plantain leaf while his subordinates immediately shouted nine times in their traditional way.

[...]

The sacrifice of goats which was an important feature of the festival, was performed in the afternoon of the third day (Yew duh) on the top of an adjacent hill where the Siem along with other members of his house, went there in a procession. The people shouted all the time while it was preceeding to that place. The musicians went round the altar first at the top of the hill thrice in anticipation of a happy and good auguers. The Chief priest facing the north, prayed to U Shillong holding a red-coloured cock in his right hand and killed it on the altar collecting its blood in a gourd vessel. The entrails of the cock were carefully examined by him and then kept on a silver plate. The Chief priest threw some grains of rice before him as also over the yellow goat and prayed to U Shillong holding a dah in his hand. He then passed on this implement to the Siem who also prayed to the deity. The Siem handed over the same to a man (nengnong) who sacrificed the goat on behalf of the Siem . He collected nine pieces of meat from different parts of the goats body ( e.g. heart, lungs, liver, stomach, kidney, etc.) and handed them over to the priest. The latter cut each piece of the meat into five parts and offered them to the five ancestors. * The procession returned to the Siem's residence when the head of the goat was brought back by a member of a Kharbamen clan. It was then given to the High-priestess for disposal of the same in a manner as she liked. The day's rituals were completed by performing the goat presentation ceremony in the midnight. The Chief musician stood very near the fire made in this occasion at the verhandah (tyngkong) of the building and called the names of different units to present their gifts, in order of their seniority. The gathering that was watching from the courtyard shouted in their traditional way three times on receipt of the Siem's acceptance and the animals were led to the kynram-blang for overnight stay before which they were not considered fit to be sacrificed to be held on the day next.",0,0,1,0,1,0

Ritual286,Naming of the Child Ceremony,"Ceremonies and Customs Attending Birth and Naming of Children

The Khasi birth ceremonies and customs are as follows:-- When a child is born the umbilical cord is cut by a sharp splinter of bamboo; no knife can be used on this occasion. The Mundas of Chota Nagpur similarly taboo a metal instrument for this purpose. The child is then bathed in hot water from a red earthen pot. The placenta is carefully preserved in an earthen vessel in the house till after the naming ceremony has taken place. When the umbilical cord, after being tied, falls off, a puja is performed with eggs to certain water deities ( ka blei sam-um and ka niangriang ), * also to a forest spirit ( u'suid bri or u'suid khláw ). The naming ceremony of the child is performed the next morning after the birth. Certain females are invited to come and pound rice in a mortar into flour. The flour when ready is placed on a bamboo winnower ( u prah ). Fermented rice is mixed with water and is placed in a gourd. Some powdered turmeric is also provided, and is kept ready in a plantain leaf, also five pieces of 'kha piah , or dried fish. The earthen pot containing the placenta is then placed in the nongpei or centre room of the house. If the child is a male, they place near him a bow and three arrows (the implements of a Khasi warrior); if a female, a da and u star , or cane head-strap for carrying burdens. An elderly man, who knows how to perform the naming puja, which is called by the Khasis “ kaba jer khun ,” places a plantain-leaf on the floor and sprinkles some water on it. He takes the gourd in his hand and calls a god to witness. The people assembled then mention a number of names for the child, and ask the man who is performing the puja to repeat them. This he does, and at the same time pours a little liquor from the gourd on to the ground. As he goes on pouring, the liquor by degrees becomes exhausted, and finally only a few drops remain. The name at the repeating of which the last drop of liquor remains adhering to the spout of the gourd is the name selected for the child. Then the puja performer invokes the god to grant good luck to the child. The father takes the pot containing the placenta, after having previously placed rice flour and fermented rice therein, and waves it three times over the child, and then walks out with it through the main entrance of the house and hangs up the pot to a tree outside the village. When he returns from this duty, before he re-enters the house, another throws water over the father's feet. The father, being thus cleansed, enters, and holds the rice flour to his mouth three times. Two people then, holding the dried fish by their two ends, break them in two. The powdered turmeric mixed with rice flour and water is applied to the right foot of the father, the mother and the child receiving the same treatment. The friends and relations are then anointed, the turmeric being applied, however, to their left feet. The bow, arrows, da , and u star are carefully placed inside the inner surface of the thatch on the roof, and the ceremony is over. Rice flour is then distributed to all who are present, and the male adults are given liquor to drink. After two or three months the ears of the child are bored and ear-rings are inserted. These ear-rings are called ki shashkor iawbei (i.e. the ear-rings of the great-grandmother). Mr. Jenkins mentions that the naming ceremony amongst the Syntengs is performed by the “eldest aunt,” presumably on the mother's side. A basket of eggs is placed in the centre of the room, and before the ceremony begins one egg has to be broken. Then the aunt of the child takes two sticks, and, raising them to her shoulder, lets them fall to the ground. Before they fall she shouts, “What name do you give the child?” The name is mentioned, and if, on falling upon the ground, one stick crosses the other, it is a proof that the name has won the approval of the spirit. If the sticks do not fall in this position, another egg is broken and another name is chosen, and the sticks are dropped as before until they fall in the required position, when it is understood by the performers that the name is a good one. Mr. Jenkins was informed by a young man “who had renounced heathenism” that some of the more cunning women cross the sticks before lifting them, and that when they do this they invariably fall crossed to the ground. “They thus save their eggs, save time and trouble, get the name they desire for the child. ...” It is noteworthy that the Khasis consider it necessary to preserve the placenta until the ceremony of naming the child is over, and that the pot containing the placenta is waved over the head of the child before it is removed and hung up in a tree.

Dr. Fraser, at page 53 et seq. of the “Golden Bough,” when dealing with the subject of sympathetic magic, refers to the navel string and the placenta as parts which are commonly believed amongst certain people to remain in sympathetic union with the body after the physical connection has been seve[unknown] red, and it is interesting to note that in the Babar Archipelago, between New Guinea and Celebes, the placenta is mixed with ashes and put in a small basket, which seven women, each of them armed with a sword, hang up on a tree of a peculiar kind ( citrus hystrix ). The women carry the swords for the purpose of frightening the cvil spirits, otherwise the latter might get hold of the placenta and make the child sick. Mr. C. M. Pleyte, Leeturer on Indonesian Ethmology, at the Gymnasium William III. at Batavia, who has most courteously furnished me with some interesting information on this subject, states that it is especially in the Southern Moluccas that the placenta is mixed with ashes and hung in a tree. Wider spread is the enstom of placing the after-birth on a small bamboo raft in a river “in order that it may be caught by crocodiles, incarnations of the ancestors, who will guard it till the person to whom it has belonged dies. Then the soul of the placenta is once more united with that of the dead man, and together they go to the realms of the dead. During lifetime the connection between men and their placentas is never withdrawn.” The Khasis, although they cannot explain the meaning of the presence of the placenta at the naming ceremony, and the care with which they remove it and hang it up in a tree, are probably really actuated by the same sentiments as the inhabitants of the Southern Moluceas, i.e. they believe that there is, as Dr. Frazer puts it, a sympathetic union with the body after the physical connection with the child- has been severed. There is no fixed period of sang , or taboo, after a birth, but the parents of the child are prohibited by custom from crossing a stream or washing their clothes until the navel-string falls off, for fear that the child should be attacked by the demons of the hills and the vales.

The Wár birth customs are substantially the same as those of the Khasis, but there is the difference that a Wár family after a birth is sang , or taboo, for seven days, whereas amongst the Khasis the only prohibition is that the parents must not cross a stream or wash their clothes until they have propitiated the spirits. A twin birth is sang , or taboo. The Khasis argue that as there is but one Ka Iawbei (first ancestress), and one U Tháwlang (first ancestor), so one child, either male or female, should be born at a time. A twin birth is accordingly regarded as a visitation from God for some sang , or transgression, committed by some member of the clan. When the twins are of opposite sexes the sang is considered to be extremely serious, the Khasi idea being that defilement has taken place within the womb. The case is treated as one of shong kur , or marriage within the clan, and the bones of the twins cannot be placed in the sepulchre of the clan.

There are no special birth customs amongst the Lynngams.

There is no trace of the couvade amongst the Khasis.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual287,Death Ceremonies,"Ceremonies Attending Death

The death customs of the Khasis are not only very elaborate, but possess a significance of their own, it is, therefore, necessary to describe them in detail; they are as follows:--

A member of the family bends down towards the ear of the apparently deceased person and calls him or her by name three times, to make sure that death has occurred. If no answer comes, the family laments, for it is then concluded that the person is really dead. The body is then bathed in warm water from three earthen pots and is reverently laid on a mat ( japung ), where it is dressed in white cloth, a peculiar feature of the dressing being that the waist-cloth and turban are folded from left to right, and not from right to left, as in the case of the living. An egg called u'leng kpoh is placed on the stomach of the deceased, and nine fried grains, of riw hadem , or Indian corn, are tied round the head with a string. The rich place car-rings in the ears and other jewellery on the body of the deceased, it being necessary that this jewellery should be specially made for the occasion, and they deck the corpse with valuable cloths. A cock, u'iar krad lynti (literally the cock that scratches the way), is sacrificed, the idea being that a cock will scratch a path for the spirit to the next world. A sacrifice of a bull, or of a cow in case the deceased is a woman, ( u or ka masi pynsum ,) follows. Portions of the left leg of the fowl and the lower part of the jaw of the bull or cow are kept, to be placed afterwards in the mawshieng , or bone, receptacle. A small basket ( ka shang ) is hung up over the head of the corpse, the basket containing pieces ( dykhot ) of the sacrificed animals. A dish containing eatables, and betel-nut, and a jar of water are placed near the head of the corpse by way of offering refreshment to the spirit of the departed. The food is given each morning and evening that the corpse remains in the house; this is called ái ja miet ja step . Each night the corpse remains in the house guns are fired, drums are beaten and flutes ( sháráti ) are played. It is a noteworthy custom that the body is not retained in the house for an even number of nights, the usual time being three nights. If it is intended to burn the body on a masonry pyre ( jingthang ), a bull ( u masi kynroh ) is sacrificed. If the body is placed in a coffin ( ka shyngoid ), a pig named u'niang shyngoid is sacrificed, and if it is intended to adorn the pyre with flags, a fowl calléd u'iar kait is sacrificed. On the day of the funeral procession pigs are sacrificed by the relatives and friends of the deceased; those who cannot afford pigs bring liquor ( ka'iad rong ), a small portion of which they pour on the funeral pyre. The coffin is laid on a bamboo bier ( ka krong ), money being placed close to the corpse, so that the spirit of the deceased may possess the wherewithal to buy food on its journey. Cotton, or, in the case of the rich, silk cloths are tied cross-ways over the bier, if the deceased is a male, and in the form of a parallelogram, if it is a female. Before lifting the bier a handful of rice and water from a jar are thrown outside, and a goat ( u'lang sait ksuid ) is sacrificed. These are purificatory ceremonies. The funeral procession then forms up and slowly passes along the way to the plaintive music of flutes ( sharati ) and the beating of drums. At intervals, in the case of the rich, salutes from guns are fired. Copper coins are also scattered along the route. On nearing the pyre the dead body is exposed to view, and the pieces of flesh of the sacrificial animals, which are with the corpse, are thrown away. They make ready three baked loaves ( ki kpu ), an egg, the lower jaw-bones of the animals which have been sacrificed, the left leg of the fowl ( u'iar krad lynti ), a jar of water, eatables in a dish, and a bow and three arrows. A goat is then sacrificed, u'lang máwkjat . The corpse is laid on the pyre, inside the coffin, if one is used, with the head to the west and the feet to the east. Logs of wood are placed around the body, and the egg; “ u'leng kpoh ,” is broken, not over the stomach of the deceased, as has been sometimes supposed, but by being thrown on the pyre in the direction of the feet of the corpse. Fire is applied to the pyre, first by the kur , or members of the clan, and then by the children, if any, of the deceased. Another fowl, “ u'iar padat ,” is sacrificed, its blood being smeared round the pyre three times, and across the corpse three times. The bier is then broken to pieces, the cloths having been removed from it previously. The eatables and the jaw-bones of the sacrificial animals are then placed at the head of the pyre. After the fowl ( u'iar padat ) has been sacrificed, the three arrows already mentioned are shot from the bow, one to the north, another to the south, and the third to the east. These arrows are called ki 'nam tympem . It is, perhaps, significant that the arrows which are shot at death correspond in numbers with those which are used at the time of the birth ceremony. When the fire has blazed up, another goat, “ u'lang dholia ,” is sacrificed. In some cases all the clothes of the deceased are burnt with the body, in others the clothes are merely held over the fire and then taken away, after which they can be used (this is only in the case of poor persons). Before leaving the burning-place the relatives and friends of the deceased place betel-nuts on the pyre and bid farewell to the deceased, saying “ Khublei khie leit bam kwai sha iing u Blei ho ” (good-bye, go and eat betel-nut in the house of god). When the body has been thoroughly burnt, the fire is extinguished with water, and the uncalcined bones are collected by the relatives in three trips. The collectors are not allowed to turn back and pick up a bone which has been forgotten in any one of these trips. The bones thus collected are carefully wrapped in a piece of white cloth by the female relatives, and an old member of the family throws on the ground some powdered rice from a leaf, at the same time adjuring the spirit of the deceased not to trouble the kur , or the family, as the funeral ceremonies have been duly performed. The party then sets out to the bone repository, or mawshieng . In front walks one who strews along the line of route leaves of the tree known by the Khasis as dieng shit (the berries of which are used for fishing with), and grains of rice, all the way from the pyre to the cairn. If any stream has to be crossed, a rough bridge is made of branches and grass. This trail of leaves and the bridges are intended to guide the spirit of the deceased to the cairn. The person who carries the bones is not allowed to turn round, or to the right, or to the left, but must proceed straight to the cairn. On reaching it, a nongknia , or sacrificer, washes the bones three times and then places them in an earthen pot, tying up the mouth with a white cloth. Then, having taken three pieces of the hard yolk of an egg, three loaves of bread, the leg of the fowl, “ u'iar krad lynti ,” and the lower jaw-bones of the animals which have been sacrificed, he places them inside the cairn and shuts the door. Eatables and betel-nut are then placed on the top of the cairn. Early next morning the relatives and friends go to the cairn with fresh food and water, and look about for new foot-prints, the idea being that from these foot-prints they can foretell future events. This they do until the third night after the cremation. During these three nights the front door of the house formerly occupied by the deceased is never closed, it being thought that the spirit may wish to return and visit its earthly abode. The whole family is moreover sang , or taboo, during this period, and no manner of work can be done. When the three nights are over, it is called the lait ia , i.e. the days (of mourning) are passed, and three eggs are broken to ascertain what was the cause of the death. After this the family goes to bathe, and the clothes and mats in the house are washed. When this has been done, the taboo is removed and the family can go to work. After a month a pig or a fowl is sacrificed, the ceremony being called “ ai bam lait bnai .” It will be observed that three seems to be the lucky number throughout these funeral ceremouics. The number seems to bear a similar significance in other matters of Khasi ritual, e.g. the pouring out of libations, which is always done three times.

It is sang or taboo for a Khasi widow to re-marry within one year from the death of her husband, there is a similar prohibition for a husband re-marrying; but such sang can be got over by the payment of a fine to the clan of the deceased. After the expiration of one year the fine is reduced in amount. Khasi widows do not as a rule re-marry, according to U Jeebon Roy, unless they have no female children, in which case the clan urges them to re-marry, so that the chain of inheritance may not be broken, inheritance amongst the Khasis always passing in the female line.

Customs in Connection with Deaths by Violence or Accident

These customs are interesting enough to deserve a separate description; they are as follows:--

If a man dies by the sword, before his body can be burnt, a sacrifice of a black hen must be offered to Ka Tyrut , the goddess of death. The bones are then placed in a stone cairn. Again they are removed, and, after eggs have been broken, are taken to a river bank and there washed. If there is no river at hand, a tank is dug for the purpose, which is called umkoi . There are various such umkois in different parts of the district, e.g. near Raliang and Nartiang. A sacrifice of a goat is offered to the god U Syngkai Bamon , and a sow to Ka Ramshandi , both of whom are evil deities. Another sow is sacrificed to Ka Tyrut . After this the bones are placed in another newlybuilt cairn. The ceremony of placing the bones in one and then removing them to another cairn is usually performed three times; but unless the auspices, as deduced from the eggs, are favourable, the relatives must go on sacrificing and removing the bones until they are so. These ceremonies having been completed, they erect a flat table-stone, or mawkynthei , for the ghost of the departed to sit upon, and return home, where they propitiate their ancestors with offerings of food. In the case of the murdered victims of the thlen superstition the same ceremonies are observed. For people who have died by drowning, or been killed by wild animals, and for women who have died in child-birth, similar pujas are offered, except that a sacrifice to U Syngkai Bamon does not take place. In the case of one who has died at a distance from his home, e.g. in a foreign country, whose body has not been burnt in accordance with custom, and whose bones have not been collected, the members of his clan, or his children, take three or five seeds or cowries ( sbai ) to a place where three roads meet. Here they summon the spirit of the departed in a loud voice, and throw up the seeds or cowries into the air, and when they fall to the ground they say, “ to alle noh ba ngin sa lum sa kynshew noh ia phi ,” come now we will collect you (the idea being that the seeds represent the bones of the deceased). Having collected the seeds, they place them on a bier and perform the service for the dead just in the same way as if a real dead body were to hand. If possible, a portion of the dead person's clothes should be burnt with the seeds in the bier, and it is with this view that the coats or cloths of Khasi coolies, who die when employed as porters on military expeditions at a distance from their homes, are brought back by their friends to give to the relatives. If a person dies of cholera, small-pox, or other such infectious or contagious disease, the body is buried, but is dug up again and burnt with all the customary rites when fear of infection or contagion is over. In parts of the district upright stones called maw-umkoi are erected along the line of route when the remains of a person who has met with an accidental death are brought home. This is stated to be the case in the Rambrai Siemship.

Miscellaneous Customs in Connection with Death

In Nongjri, a large village in the War Country, the dead body is placed on a bier near the door of the house, a turban being tied about the head, the face being left bare and turned towards the door. In some of the Shella villages a second cremation is performed, in which a bamboo frame-work represents the corpse. This second cremation takes place when the body has been disposed of without the requisite ceremonies. The bones and ashes of the dead in Shella are in some cases kept in a cavity hollowed out of a post erected for the purpose. The bones and ashes find a temporary resting-place here, but are afterwards removed to a cromlech.

At Nartiang, in the Jaintia Hills, the head of the corpse is shaved, but a tuft of hair in the middle of the head is left; this is called ( u'niuh Iawbei ), the great grandmother's lock. At Nartiang betel-nut, which has been chewed by one of the mourners, is put into the mouth of the corpse, also cooked rice. There is a similar custom prevalent amongst the Khyrwangs. The Nongtungs, in the Jaintia Hills, keep dead bodies sometimes as long as a month, until the phur or ceremonial dance has been performed. Hence they are called Nong-tung , or “stinkers.” Amongst the Lynngams the dead body is kept for sometimes three or four months, or up to the time when a bull can be procured for a feast to the villagers. This feast is an essential, and, cattle being scarce in the Lynngam country, there is often great delay in disposing of the body. Lynngam villages at such a time are best avoided. The Lynngams of Nongsohbar bury the unburnt bones of the deceased within the village, and in front of the house occupied by the deceased when alive, the bones being placed in a hole in the ground, over which is laid a stone, a bamboo mat being nailed over the stone. A bamboo fence three or four feet high is erected round the grave. Other Lynngams bury the uncalcined bones and ashes in a gourd in the jungle near the burning-place. On their way home, the members of the clan of the deceased who have come from other villages to witness the funeral obsequies, put up a stone on the path in honour of the deceased, a turban being tied round the top of the stone. The Garos or Dkos, who live at the foot of the hills on the Kamrup border, and are called by the Assamese Hana (spear-men), erect memorial stones in honour of the deceased, the lower jaw-bones of sacrificial animals and other articles being hung on the stones. The stones are also swathed in cloths, and turbans are tied round the tops. The death customs of the Lynngams, and, indeed, other customs also, are partly Khasi and partly Garo, it being difficult to say that the Lynngams are more Khasi than Garo, or more Garo than Khasi in this respect; their language, however, has been found by Dr. Grierson to be a corruption of Khasi. In Nongstoin, Mawlih, and Mariaw villages, the inhabitants of which profess to be Khasis, the bones and ashes of the deceased are not collected and placed in repositories, as at Cherrapunji. At Mariaw and Nongstoin a large wooden coffin is used, painted white, with ornamentations on the outside, and standing on four legs. This coffin is not burnt on the funeral pyre. In the family of the chiefs of Cherra, the body of a deceased Siem is subjected to the following process:--It is wrapped in a cloth and placed in the hollowed-out trunk of a tree, ka-shyngoid , there being a small hole with a plug at the bottom of this receptacle. Spirit is then poured into the shyngoid until the whole body is immersed, the liquor being allowed to stand for three days. After the body has been thus steeped, the liquor is allowed to run out, and the body is washed with warm water, after which it is allowed to dry for a day. Then a quantity of lime-juice is poured in, the latter being obtained from the fresh fruit of the lime ( u soh jew ). The body is thus exposed to a process of pickling, which continues until the whole is thoroughly dry and becomes like that of a mummy. It is then placed in a coffin, which is kept in the house of the Siem family until it is time to perform the funeral obsequies. These ceremonies entail a very large amount of expense, and it sometimes happens that they cannot be completed for some years after the death of a Siem. The body of a deceased Siem according to the Cherra custom should be burnt by his successor; otherwise the latter is not Siem according to the Khasi religion. The last Siem of Cherra, U Hajon Manik, did not perform the funeral obsequies of his predecessor, U Ram Singh, and it is stated that many of his subjects did not regard him as Siem, according to the Khasi religion, in consequence. There are at the present time the corpses of two Siems of Cherra which have been preserved in the manner described above, awaiting cremation. The first Siem, U Ram Singh, died as far back as 1875, and the second, U Hajon Manik, died in 1901.

Sir Joseph Hooker and other authorities have stated that the bodies of deceased Siems of Cherra used to be embalmed in honey, and an amusing story is told regarding the necessity of exercising caution in purchasing honey from Cherra (honey being plentiful in this neighbourhood), except in the comb, for fear of honey which has been used for embalming purposes being passed off on the unwary purchaser. But the members of the Siem family and the old residents deny that honey is used for this purpose nowadays, possibly in the interests of the trade. It is, however, not unlikely that honey was so utilized in days gone by, as it is a well-known agent for embalming. The bodies of priests in Burmah are said to be embalmed in honey, vide Yule's “Embassy to Ava.”",0,1,0,0,1,0
Ritual288,Disposal of the Dead,"The collection of the uncalcined bones and ashes of the deceased members of the clan and their bestowal in the mawbah , or great cinerarium of the clan, is without doubt the most important religious ceremony that the Khasis perform. That this ceremony is now but seldom celebrated, is due partly to the difficulty that exists in obtaining general agreement amongst the members of the clans, and partly to the considerable expense it entails. The information I have obtained regarding the ceremony, although differing to some extent in detail from that recorded by the late U Jeebon R[unknown] oy, agrees with the latter's account as regards the main facts. The information may now be set down as follows. By way of premise it may be stated that the bones and ashes of the deceased are kept after cremation in small stone cairns, or mawshieng . From these small cairns the bones and ashes are removed to larger bone repositories called mawphew , each branch of a clan possessing a repository of its own. The ceremony attending the removal of the bones and ashes from the small cairns to the larger repository, or mawphew , and the ceremony attached to the removal of these remains from the mawphew to the sepulchre of the clan are practically the same, except that when the bones are removed to the mawphew , no female dancing takes place. First of all, the members of the various branches of the clan collect the bones from the different subsidiary repositories, when a ceremony called “ khot ia u lor u kap ,” which it is not necessary to describe here, is performed. The bones of the deceased males and females are kept separately, and preparations are made to bring them to the sepulchre of the clan. Before, however, anything further can be done, it must be ascertained that the members of the clan are at peace with one another and no differences exist. If all differences are settled, a sacrificer offers up a prayer that the sins of the clans-folk may be for-given, and then breaks eggs and sacrifices a cock to ascertain which will be a propitious day for depositing the bones in the sepulchre. A lucky day having been thus ascertained, the bones and ashes are brought to the iing seng , or clan puja-house, the bones of males and females being kept in separate bundles wrapped in white cloth, two women of the clan reverently carrying them in their arms, holding the bundles of bones to their breasts. One female carries the bones of the males and the other those of the females. In front of these women walks an old man who scatters along the way leaves of the dieng-shit tree and grains of rice, and when it is necessary to cross any stream or river, he ties a thread from one side of the bank to the other, this is for the spirit of the departed to cross the water. Sometimes u'nam tohrih , a kind of long grass, is used instead of thread for the above purpose. On arrival at the clan puja-house, the bones of the males are laid on one bed and those of the females on another, the beds being bedecked with rich hangings. A cock, u'iar kradlynti (lit.: “the cock which scratches the way”), is sacrificed, this sacrifice being considered by the Khasis to be of peculiar significance. A pig, a cock, and a bull are then sacrificed, and portions of the above are offered to the spirits of the deceased. These offerings are known by the name of ai-bam , and are placed in a basket which is hung up in the house, together with the left thigh of the fowl and the lower jaw-bone of the bullock. A dance is performed that night, first in the house by two women, one belonging to the clan and the other an outsider, and afterwards in a specially prepared place outside the house called “ lympung .” The sharati , or flute, which is played at funerals is sounded, drums are beaten, and bombs are exploded. This dancing lasts from one to nine days, the limit being always an uneven number of days. At Cherra two effigies called Ka Puron and U Tyngshop are prepared and dressed up; the former is intended to represent Ka Iawbei , the first ancestress, and the other U Suidnia , the first maternal uncle of the clan. These effigies are held in the hands of the dancers. In the meantime two lines of upright stones consisting of three each, with a table stone in front of each line, have been set up. These are called mawkjat or mawlynti , and are intended to serve as resting-places for the spirits of the dead on their way to the tomb of the clan. These stones are generally not more than three feet in height, and must not be confounded with the larger stones or mawbynna . On the night before it is proposed to deposit the bones, a ceremony called “ Beh-tympew ” is performed, which consists of driving out the devils from the house, so that they may not interfere with the peace of the spirits of the departed whilst they rest in the house, and on their journey to the tomb. All the men after they have performed this ceremony are given a drink of rice-beer known as 'iad nonglieh . Another cock is sacrificed, and a small bamboo ladder of three rungs is prepared for the use of the spirits when climbing into the tomb. Rice is then thrown outside the door. The next morning they perform further sacrifices, which need not be detailed here, and let loose a bull whose horns have been cased in silver. They dig two shallow tanks called umkoi , into which is poured water supposed to possess the virtue of purifying the bones of any deceased clansmen who have died violent or unnatural deaths, or at places far away from their homes, where it was not possible to perform their funeral ccremonies according to custom. Three vertical stones are also crected, called maw umkoi . A bamboo with a white flag, and a plantain tree are set up; to the bamboo are attached three bamboo rings ( kyrwoh ), which are supposed to act as summonses to the spirits of the departed who have not received the benefits of a proper funeral ceremony. It may be explained that this ring of bamboo or caue is the form of summons used by the Khasi chiefs to their subjects when they wish to call them before them. Then a cock, u'iar umkoi , is sacrificed as a vicarious victim to bear the sins of the departed. When the procession-reaches the mawkjat or mawlynti (the upright stones which have been erected), a goat called u'lang mawlynti is sacrificed. Then a bamboo is fixed to the centre one of the three upright stones, to which is attached the lower jaw-bone of one of the cattle sacrificed in the puja-house; this is called u masi mawlynti . A special ceremony called kalyngka-pongrei is then performed for those of the clan who have died childless. We now come to the actual ceremony of placing the bones in the tomb of the clan. Having arrived at the tomb, the bones are washed three times in a dish (this is a Cherra custom). In Mawshai, the bones are exposed to the heat of a fire kindled on a small jingthang , or burning-platform. The stone door of the cinerarium is then opened, and the bones of the females are placed in an earthen pot inside the tomb close to the wall which is farthest away from the door, the bones of the males being deposited in a pot inside the tomb nearest the door. Some clans keep the pot containing the bones of the males on the right, and the vessel containing those of the females on the left hand. Then offerings of food and libations of liquor are offered to the ancestors on a stone in front of the tomb. The males then perform a ceremonial dance with swords and shields, three times, and the door of the sepulchre is closed, a flag being fixed to the tomb. All the clansfolk then depart except three men. One of these sacrifices a cock ( iar-tanding ) in front of the tomb, a second sits behind the sacrificer, holding three firebrands, and a third sits behind the tomb. The man with the firebrands shakes them about, and then crows like a cock three times. The man behind the tomb listens attentively for any fancied noise within it, the superstition being that if the ceremonies detailed above have not been properly performed, the whole tomb will quake. If the three watchers are satisfied that there is no commotion within the tomb, then all is well, and they return and report the result to the clanspeople. This ceremony is called tanding , or the fire test. Next morning the woman who is the head of the iing-seng , or puja-house, distributes to all those who have taken part in these sacrifices the hinder portions of the sacrificial animals. She then blesses one by one the assembled clansfolk. The latter are not permitted by custom to go to work until after three days from the time of the ceremony; the third day being called ka sngi lait ia . The ceremony described above is a symbolical one. The massive stone sepulchre is regarded as a symbol of a secure place of rest for the departed spirits. If the spirits of the dead are not, however, appeased by the due performance of the ceremonies attending the bestowal of the remains in the clan cinerarium , it is believed that they roam about and haunt their relations on earth, and plague them with various misfortunes. It may be interesting to note here, that Mr. Moberly, the Superintendent of Ethnography in Bengal, reports that the ashes of deceased Hos, after being sprinkled with water by means of peepul branches, are collected, dried, and placed in a new earthen pot, and kept in the house until the day of burial, which may take place, as with",0,0,0,0,1,0

Ritual293,The Rite of Confession,"The Rite of Confession and ""Pass Dances""

The rite of confession, a part of most Midwinter gatherings, is usually held before the Festival itself begins. At Tonawanda a person must request the confession rite. This rite includes a recitation of part of the Code of Handsome Lake by a “preacher” and public confessions by all who want to participate. A string of wampum lies on a bench. It is picked up and held by a person who confesses some violation of the Gaiwiio. It is then replaced. Ideally, this rite of confession is held before all rites addressed to the Creator. The rite today is similar in some aspects to the directives of Handsome Lake concerning the repentance of witches (Code, 2). For example, on the Six Nations Reserve those who do not want to confess publicly may go into the woods, near a swamp or crossroads and confess privately to the Creator. Or they may confess and repent in their own mind and resolve to discontinue all paranoia over what another person may or may not be saying about them. Not only does this “purify” them before beginning the New Year and participating in a Creator's ritual but it also emphasizes the need to be reconciled with others in the community. It does manifest something about the modern Iroquoian, namely that ill-luck or bad health is often believed to have been caused by someone else. Since many of the illnesses are psychosomatic, both the confession rituals and the curing ceremonies function to alleviate anxiety.

At the Six Nations Longhouses part of the second day and most of the third day are spent in fulfilling or renewing obligatory dances. Today three types of “pass dances” are appropriate.

First, there are the periodic observances which derive from obligations incurred by joining, for legitimate and natural reasons, one of the formalized medicine societies. This means that the individual must have joined the medicine society because he was ill, or dreamed he should join, or made use of the society in forming a ritual friendship . . . or was asked to join.
. . . The second type of appropriate observance is that which calls for a social or ceremonial dance, or for one of the four sacred rites, or for a ceremonial game, because at one time one of these had been performed for or by the individual, due to an illness, a dream, formation of a ritual friendship, or other legitimate reasons. . . . The third type of observance is one in which a person asks to have any dance, ritual or game performed, not because he wishes to “pass” his dance and fulfill an obligation, but merely because he desires to offer it as a particular devotional act. The last type is most often exemplified by the performance of an Ado'wa song or by a dance for the entire family.

These three are medicinal in nature, are perceived as a part of the “medicine” itself and absolutely necessary for its efficacy. The opposite moiety always takes the responsibility of administering the “medicine” and arranging the ritual. This division of labor reflects the dual social system of the Iroquois and is ancient in character. It also exemplifies the ancient Iroquois practice of mutual help and sharing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual294,False Face Ceremony,"False Face Ceremony

The False Face Ceremony, which occurs next on the calendar, is called ??ethi[unknown] hsot hena[unknown] d??ui ??athenada[unknown] wenye?? (“grandfathers hunchback they travel,” or in the colloquial English of the Reserve, “the False Faces are traveling”).

The scheduling of this event is assigned to the two False Face Society leaders of the Longhouse, one from each moiety. The Canadian False Face Societies, unlike those at the Seneca reservations in the United States, are headed at present by men. The leaders in the False Face Society at Sour Springs in 1958 were Ernie Davis for the Turtle moiety and Willie John for the Wolf moiety. They were appointed by the men of the Longhouse, and neither inherited the position from a member of his family. The moiety division of the False Face Society is often questioned, and there is some confusion as to its propriety. The traveling bands of False Faces at Onondaga and Seneca and the company at Sour Springs Longhouse are not divided according to a moiety arrangement, nor is there moiety division in the False Face Day curing ceremony or in the private curing ceremonies at Six Nations. Informants claim, “The False Faces have no clans.” Nevertheless, there is a Turtle and a Wolf False Face “headman,” and at the Midwinter curing the patient is treated by False Faces belonging to the opposite moiety.

Tradition dictates that the event should occur when the ground is dry in early spring, and consequently at Sour Springs it is in the latter part of April. The rationalization which is now adduced to explain why the ground should be dry is that the False Faces should “roll” into the Longhouse on the ground, since they are the earthly counterpart of the Thunder Spirit which “rolls” in heaven; and since the False Faces are thus forced to move on the ground, they should not have to do so on wet ground. Again one notices the tendency to analogize on any level, as well as the search for rationalization and explanation. At Seneca and Onondaga, however, the False Face Ceremony usually takes place at the end of March, before most of the men leave for spring seasonal work, and often the False Faces “go around” when the ground is wet with mud and snow.

The two False Face leaders should “go around” and inform the members of their Longhouse of the date of the False Face event. At Sour Springs the messenger will be given some Indian tobacco “for the False Faces” at each household, and it is this tobacco which is burned at the Longhouse at the tobacco invocation. Today, no False Faces “travel” at the upper end, which means that the band of masked society members does not visit the houses of the Longhouse members in order to chase away disease from the house, and the False Faces visit only the Longhouse itself during the day of the ceremony. The reason for neglecting the “traveling rite” is that too many Christians live interspersed among the Sour Springs community, and the company would have to visit widely scattered farmsteads, most of whose owners would be away working. Therefore, at Sour Springs, the Longhouse is considered the “home” of each member at this event, so that symbolically the home of each one has been cleansed of disease as surely as if the False Faces had visited the actual house. At the three Longhouse communities down below, however, the traveling rite still persists, and the tobacco, instead of being given to the messenger as at Sour Springs, is given to the leader of the traveling “gang” when the False Faces purify the house. The Longhouse ceremony takes place in the afternoon, usually around 4:00 P.M., although it should really occur around noon. The “traveling rite” usually starts around 2:00 P.M., and the False Faces will often go from house to house by car. The rite of the “traveling” is traditional. For example, at Onondaga Longhouse in 1955, one band of False Faces “went around.” Bill Sherry (actually a member of Seneca Longhouse) was the leader, and the tour started at his house on the River Road. The band then came westward on the River Road to Tom Longboat's Corner, up the Onondaga Longhouse side road to the Seneca Line, where they visited Mrs. Smoke and Betsy Sky, and then up to Violet and Bill Thomas and from there into the Longhouse. Members living farther away than the points on this route were missed. A typical False Face visit at a home begins with the entrance of an unmasked leader of the group, carrying a staff (the symbol of the False Faces), preferably made of hickory, and a corn-bread paddle (the symbol of the Husk Faces). Immediately following this leader, several Husk Faces (gadji[unknown] hsa??) tumble in, dancing about and hopping from toe to toe. They carry sticks and branches and corn-bread paddles and perform their characteristic dance, as the leader sings for them briefly. Then the four False Face songs are sung, and the False Faces roll in on the floor, dancing and mimicking and rubbing their rattles along the furnishings of the house. (The center of the room has been cleared to permit the dancing of the visitors.) Much of the dance and the antics are left to spontaneous action, and there is much personal variation in the performance of the False Face dancers. At the end of the purification of the house, the leader is handed a package of Indian tobacco, usually wrapped in brown paper. The False Faces emit joyous grunts of satisfaction, and gesticulating wildly, they leave the house.

The primary purposes of the False Face Ceremony are to pay respects to the False Face Spirits (which are the earthly counterpart of the Thunder Spirit), to placate them with tobacco, and to ask that they in return disperse all diseases for the coming season and control the whirlwinds and other crop-destroying winds. The chasing of disease applies not only to illness of the human body but also to the diseases which attack livestock, plants, and foods. Thus, the False Face Ceremony combines personal curing, agricultural prophylaxis, and spirit supplication.

The program at Sour Springs Longhouse begins with the Thanksgiving Address, after which there usually is an anxious, hushed waiting period, while the maskers finish dressing in the cookhouse. The masks to be used have been rubbed with lard (in lieu of the traditional sunflower seed oil) in order to have them look shiny and new (to “brighten them up”), and also to indicate to the False Face that “it is being taken care of.” Rubbing with lard is partly an aesthetic and secular act, done to clean the mask and “make it look good.” It also indicates that the owner is careful of, and respectful to, the mask. Since neglect of the act would “hurt the feelings” of the “Face,” and in revenge the “Face” would make the owner ill, it could be termed a prophylactic medicinal action. The rubber, however, thinks of the lard as a beautifying agent. The fear of disease is the almost subconscious sanction which underlies not only the attentions to the mask, but most of the ritual.

Suddenly the door opens, and a Husk Face (male or female) runs through the house, entering at the women's door and exiting at the men's, sometimes re-entering at the men's door and exiting then at the women's door. The Husk Face is masked and dressed so as to hide the identity of the performer. The Husk Faces are dumb, and therefore they say nothing, but they must never keep still, and consequently they “wiggle” as they rush through “the house.” After an appropriate pause, the gutteral whinnies of the False Face language will be heard outside the women's door, and the unmasked leader of the False Face group (False Faces from both moieties being combined into one group) pushes open the door with his hickory staff and sings the entering song of the False Faces, which belongs to the Stirring Ashes genre and is almost identical to the Stirring Ashes Song sung for the Great Creator at the beginning of the Midwinter Stirring Ashes Ceremony. The masked False Faces, always males, covered over with burlap sacking and carrying large turtle rattles, roll and tumble into the house over the sill of the women's door, go around the house counterclockwise, and lie down beside the men's stove. A considerable amount of clowning, gesticulating, rattle shaking, grunting, ash rubbing, and handling of hot coals from the stove precedes the settling down of the “Faces.” Whereas an air of gaiety prevails at all the Longhouses, the False Face antics at Sour Springs seem much more solemn than at Onondaga, nor do the False Faces distract attention from the tobacco-burning invocation as they do at Onondaga, where they continue to clown throughout the invocation. At Sour Springs any False Face mask may be worn, and the distinctions of “doorkeeper” and “common” and “beggar” masks are not known. (Only one mask was recently forbidden--“taken off”--at Sour Springs, because it looked like the work of the devil and was evil and “made fun of the Longhouse.” This was a mask carved by a church member, and it displayed two horns.) There is no doorkeeper at Sour Springs as there is among the New York Seneca (Fenton, 1940: 420, 427, and Parker, 1913: 127), for none of the Longhouses at Six Nations have an indigenous doorkeeper concept. However, at Onondaga, in 1955, a member who had originally come to Six Nations from Tonawanda appointed himself “doorkeeper.” The doorkeeper is supposed to prevent any member from leaving the Longhouse during the tobacco invocation and the purification of the Longhouse and people. He also rubs the door with his rattle each time a latecomer opens it to enter the Longhouse, as if to disinfect it again after allowing some disease agent to enter through the opened door.

Any able speaker may perform the tobacco-burning rite, and the designated person, who is announced to the congregation, is handed the tobacco collected by the False Face leaders on their rounds to the houses. The speaker steps to the men's stove and recites the speech in which tobacco is offered to all those items in any way connected with the False Faces. The speaker reminds the False Faces of their promise to the Great Creator to protect the people, to drive away disease, and to control high winds. He offers tobacco for each attribute and asks that the spirits should still continue to fulfill their promise. Tobacco is offered also so that thunder and lightning may not strike and that the wild beasts above the clouds and the snakes and vermin below the ground will continue to be controlled. Then the speaker offers tobacco to the bush, to the trees (usually hickory) from which the staff of the False Face is cut, to the living trees which provide the material for the Faces, to the turtle rattles which are the property of the False Face men, to the tobacco which is the favorite of the False Faces, to the mush which is the food of the False Faces, to the fire and ashes which help cure, and to the Husk Face which is the messenger of the False Faces. As each item is mentioned, a pinch of tobacco is thrown into the fire. Also, at the mention of the rattles, hickory, and tobacco, the masked impersonators respond by rubbing their rattles on the ground, talking False Face language, and in general showing their pleasure at the gift of tobacco by “getting mad” (which means becoming joyously agitated). Those sections of the recitation which pertain to the False Faces themselves and the accoutrements of the False Faces are recited twice, once for the Black False Faces and then for the Red False Faces. The two categories of Faces are seen as separate groups of personalities. At the end of the invocation a pinch of tobacco is handed to each of the maskers. They smell it, blow it as in curings, rub it between their hands, place some in their pipes if they happen to be carrying them, snuff it, and throw it into the stove. The speaker finishes by burning the remainder of the tobacco and its container, usually a brown paper bag.

Two men then take their seats in the center of the house and play the four False Face tunes, to which the False Faces execute their characteristic dance. This set is played with a large turtle rattle, though not as large as those carried by the maskers. At Sour Springs the set is then repeated using only a wooden beater. (This seems to occur only at Sour Springs Longhouse. George Green made the wooden beater, which most probably is a corn-bread paddle used only for this occasion and stored in the Longhouse.) 11 Thereafter a single man sings for the Husk Faces' dance, using a corn paddle or wooden stick, and the Husk Faces perform their antics. The set of False Face dry-pole songs (dyõhsi?dahdi[unknown] has) is sung, again, according to my informants at Sour Springs, using the wooden beater. The False Faces now rush around the inside of the house counterclockwise, chasing all the participants off their seats, touching and rubbing the benches, appurtenances, corners, and floor with their rattles, for this symbolizes the “chasing of the disease.” In their act of purification the False Faces may take liberties--jostling the girls, poking the matrons, uttering False Face cries close to the more nervous of the congregation, and in general “making an impression” on the population. The “proper” attitude toward the False Faces in the Longhouse is to be frightened, and even if one is not actually frightened, one must pretend to be afraid and mention that one finds the False Faces fierce looking and “scary.” (Fenton, 1940:428-9, cites an instance encountered by Margaret Mead, in which a sophisticated woman of Shawnee-Cayuga parentage, now residing among the Omaha, remembers with dread the False Face experiences of her early childhood.) Most of the children at Six Nations will state their fear of the False Faces, although they will sing the songs and play with the masks when given a chance. Whereas one must at all times display respect for the masks, in Canada they need not be hung facing the wall or covered with a cloth. “Faces” are personified, and individuals, despite their fear, become as much attached to their masks as to friends.

The entire membership is forced to participate in the round dance around the two stoves, which consists merely of walking around the two stoves in single file, men preceding women, in a counterclockwise direction. Then the False Faces run out, using both doors. Ideally, the maskers should remain anonymous and unrecognized, but in fact everyone tries to figure out “who is dancing.” The masks are recognized and discussion as to who looks “funny” in whose borrowed mask is one of the gaieties of the ceremony. It will be discussed for days, as will the general antics of the performers. False Face Day is perhaps the favorite ceremony of the general population; it certainly is the most exciting visually and the gayest, and consequently is most prominently recommended to the visitor.

Should any individual wish a cure of some specific illness or prophylaxis against future illness or a renewal of a cure, the False Faces are called back into the Longhouse for special ministration. All the cures must be accompanied by separate offerings of roasted mush and cookies to the False Faces; and corn bread, sugared grease bread, cookies, and unroasted mush to the Husk Faces, if they are asked to perform. These foods must have been prepared or secured by the patient over and above the share which is brought to the Longhouse for the general distribution of food. The offering is given to the performers immediately after their efforts at the personal cure, and is shared only by the patient and not by the rest of the congregation. This food represents not only the “payment” and the symbol of attention to the False Face Spirit, but is also “part of the medicine.” No dry-pole curing may be held at the False Face Ceremony.

Finally, the communal food is distributed--False Face much (the same roasted-white-corn mush as at the Bush Dance), cookies, scones, corn bread, bread, etc. The passing of cleansing medicinal drinks, as in the United States, is not known at Six Nations. The usual procedure of distribution is followed, and the False Face impersonators receive a share along with the rest of the congregation, for they have unmasked in the meantime and have mingled with the congregation.

At Sour Springs the False Face Ceremony is thus a mixture of general dispersion of disease, supplication of the False Face Spirits, supplication for a propitious growing season unharmed by winds, and curing of the individual himself. At Onondaga and Seneca the personal curing does not occur in the Longhouse, but those who are found unwell at their homes can be treated there.

A brief summary of the ritual at Onondaga--which is slightly different from the ceremony at Sour Springs--is as follows (data from March 29, 1955) : Josie Logan announced the program to the congregation. Roy Buck gave a short version of the Thanksgiving Address. The False Faces peeked in the door and closed it again. Finally, after the Address was finished, the leader, Bill Sherry, entered followed by the Husk Faces and the False Faces. He walked toward the right singing the Stirring Ashes-type False Face song, and then seated himself in the center of the house on the players' bench and sang the Husk Face songs, accompanying himself with a corn-bread paddle. The Husk Faces danced, and were followed by the dance of the False Faces, whose song was also sung by Bill Sherry, again using the corn-bread paddle. Josie Logan then announced that Roy Buck would give the tobacco invocation, which he delivered at the men's stove. (At Onondaga, as at Sour Springs, moiety considerations do not determine roles during False Face Day.) The tobacco invocation lasted 20 minutes, during which time the False Faces continued clowning. Bill Buck's mask was conspicuous for its large nose, which was repeatedly blown with a remarkably white handkerchief. The Husk Faces flitted around fighting with the False Faces and teasing and poking them. The False Faces wiped their metal eyes, pulled their hair, brushed their teeth, teased the populace, puffed on pipes, and indicated pleasure at each offering of tobacco to them and to their accoutrements. At the end of the invocation, Bill Sherry gave each masker some tobacco, distributing it counterclockwise, which the pipe-smoking False Faces smoked and the rest burned in the stove (only the men's stove was lit). Jake Henry then sat at the center bench, facing the women, and with a corn-bread paddle sang first the Husk Face songs, to which the Husk Faces danced, and then the False Face songs. Both sets of maskers danced counterclockwise around the stoves and, at the repetition of the songs, chased the populace from the benches to participate in the dance. Bill Sherry led, followed by Roy Buck, and then by Josie Logan. The False Faces continued to “rub down” the building with their rattles and to finish the purification. Then they ran cut to change. Roy Buck “finished up” with a one- to two-minute version of the Thanksgiving Address. Food was brought in by Albert and Gilbert Thomas and set at the women's stove. Sam Silversmith ladled it into pails, which were also placed at the women's stove. No cookies were passed. Time: 4:00-5:30 P.M. Attendance: 30 unmasked males, 50 females, 15 masked men.

Of the 13 False Face masks employed, one was a red wolf's head with grinning silvered teeth (not cut through), fur trim, and no hair; one was yellowish-white with a hare-lipped mouth; eight were red; the remainder black. One masker appeared in a black fur-seal coat, with a fur hat and fur tacked to his red mask. Those masks lacking hair had fur, and-one black mask had bags of tobacco suspended all around the outlines of the face. Some cornhusk braids were worn as neck wreaths.",1,0,0,1,1,1
Ritual295,Thanksgiving Address,"The Thanksgiving Address

The activities within the Longhouse belong essentially to three complexes: (1) the ethical, moral, and cosmological considerations embodied in the Code of Handsome Lake and in the apocryphal addenda recited simultaneously with the Code; (2) the supplication of, and thanksgiving to, the graded spirit forces; and (3) the activities concerning the health and well-being of the individual himself. This classification, while perhaps not so definitely formalized, is nevertheless recognized by the practicing member himself. As one member put it, he goes to the Longhouse because “it is our main body, our main meeting house. If I do what's right, it will take me to heaven when I die. It's really my church.” But he also goes to the Longhouse “to pass the dances for the things that grow” and “to pass my dance.”

There are some occasions which are specifically dedicated to the teachings of Handsome Lake and the moral and ethical concepts associated therewith, such as the Code recitals in the fall of the year or the small conventions of individual Longhouses held most commonly at Strawberry time or occasionally before the Midwinter Ceremony. There are other occasions dedicated primarily to one of the spirit forces, such as Green Corn, Bush Dance, and the Thunder Ceremony. There are still other occasions reserved for the welfare of the Longhouse member himself, at which the spirit forces minister especially to the human member, such as the days set aside at Midwinter on which the “pass dances” are performed. However, the majority of the ceremonies combine some aspects from all three of the complexes. There is no hard and fast line between attention to the Great Creator and attention to Handsome Lake, or even to the individual who is performing, although there is a recognition of the grading and ordering of these entities.

One must carefully distinguish, however, between Handsome Lake as the prophet and teacher of Gaihwi[unknown] yo, the moral and ethical mentor revered at the “conventions,” and Handsome Lake as incorporated into the hierarchy of the spirit forces and existing as one of the spirits of the Upper Pantheon. When Handsome Lake is referred to in the Thanksgiving Address, for example, he is not to be thought of as the prophet of the Code (although the Code is mentioned), but as one of the spirits. The same kind of distinction applies to human beings, for in one sense they are considered separately from the hierarchy of spirit forces and are the object of a separate complex of ceremonials, yet in other contexts man is simply one of the spirit forces on earth. The participant finds no inconsistency in the two treatments of Handsome Lake or in the two views of human beings. Every entity has its assignation and rank in the over-all ordering of the universe, and each also has its special sphere of action and attention.

Perhaps the best way to indicate the Iroquoian concept of the spirit forces is to examine the content of the Thanksgiving Address, which is the opening speech at almost any of the Longhouse meetings and at all of the religious gatherings. This address illustrates better than any other the organization of the Iroquoian world, as well as the relationships between the groups in the hierarchy. It is the repetition of this ordering, together with the “forewords” addressed to the gathering of human beings, which over and over again focuses the world for the listener. Many of the Longhouse speeches and tobacco-burning rites and medicine rites, as well as song cycles (e.g., the Great Feather Dance) are derivative from, or patterned after, the Thanksgiving Address.

The opening of the address concerns the uniting of many minds, or many people, in order to work together, and the thankfulness which attends such a gathering. This concept has become of paramount importance, for no amount of worship by the individual alone can be as effective as worship in which many people participate and help. Admonitions of “working together,” “getting together,” “helping” (by which is meant participating) are repeated at the beginning of almost every Longhouse speech. All society dances in the Longhouse and all dances to the Great Creator, the Four Angels, Handsome Lake, the Sky Pantheon, or the earthly sphere are considered more effective and more pleasing to the spirit forces when done by a large group rather than by a few people. Almost no curing ceremony, no cooperative bee, no singing society, no gathering of any kind, including social dances, at which the Longhouse membership is involved starts or ends without the invocation to “togetherness,” and an exhortation to take part in the event. The introductory section of the Thanksgiving Address thanks the Creator for permitting the gathering, even as the people had gathered previously, without a loss to the nation, and it thanks the people for their participation. A synopsis of Alexander General's version (according to his own translation) is as follows:

My relatives have conferred it upon me that I should speak some forewords to you. I am to speak on behalf of you people who have now gathered at this time of day, for which our Creator has given us this rule to express our thanks. First, we ourselves feel that we are all well and contented, and we have not heard of any sad incident to our people in this neighborhood. Therefore, we will greet each other that we are fortunate and everyone is well and contented, and we now unite our minds to greet each other that we have come together at this time of day.

The main body of the Address is the enumeration and invocation of the entities of the universe, beginning with the youngest and lowliest and proceeding to the oldest and most powerful and most respected. There is a standard pattern which limits the range and detail of the items mentioned, but the Address is flexible, and a good speaker will introduce as many specific themes or familiar traits as he can, or as he thinks the congregation will tolerate. Variations occur mainly after the “forewords,” in the sections dealing with the earthly and heavenly spirits. A speaker may wish to impress the congregation with a particular series of spirits on particular occasions. For example, at agricultural ceremonies he may enumerate at length and in detail the various plants, foods, and perhaps water. Or a speaker may “take out certain words,” which means that he may make use of a specific section of the Address out of context in order to make a point about the spirit forces involved. Mr. General thinks that “the higher up one goes in the Address, the more there is to do,” that is, the more words should be addressed to the spirit forces; but this is more of an idealization than actual practice. The entire recitation usually takes approximately 25 minutes, but each speaker can vary the length according to his desire. Mr. General says that he always speaks the Address “fast,” because “people get bored,” but Bill Thomas, the speaker at Seneca Longhouse, says that he always uses the long version, “so that people will learn.” When the Address is repeated at the end of the day's events, it is likely to be shortened drastically, and, in fact, usually consists merely of a short resumé in which each of the major categories of the hierarchy is briefly mentioned; even in this version the people are always thanked for their participation.

The first category enumerated consists of the things on earth.

Now we refer to our Mother Earth. He that created the universe, his wish was that the people that he created are to dwell on earth. His intention was that the people will enjoy it on earth.

Speakers then dwell on those things which grow or are found on earth (omitting human beings, however, even though they fit in the earthly sphere, because they have already been mentioned separately in the introduction). Special attention is given to such items as strawberries, maple trees, hickory trees, and medicinal plants, which play special roles in the Iroquoian culture. In Alexander General's version, the enumeration in this category begins with “grasses.”

First, there were grasses of various kinds he has planted on earth. Some are to bear fruit which the people will benefit from. [Here are inserted references to strawberries, raspberries, etc., depending on the occasion.]

The grasses which bear fruit are already considered in a higher class than those which do not. Medicines, conceived as herbal and bush medicines, are mentioned next:

We now refer to another which he has planted on earth, the bushes that are growing. There are some of the bushes that also bear [fruit] for the people to benefit from. He has planted many bushes, some of which contain a medicinal. His intention when he planted these is that they help the people to regain their health. Should illness affect the people on earth, they shall use this medicinal for the purpose of regaining their health. It is thankful that his creation is still continuing to this day.

Mr. General then continues by describing the trees and forests:

And we also refer to the forest. There are many kinds of trees growing. There is one tree that has sap flowing from it, and we call it maple. His intention was that whenever the wind changes this tree will flow sap, and that the people will benefit in consuming this substance. [Hickory trees are also mentioned here, especially during the False Face ceremonial, for the hickory is the special familiar of the False Faces, and both the cane and the “face” itself are often fashioned from hickory. Fruit-bearing trees may also be mentioned here.]

Animals, especially wild and food-bearing animals, are enumerated next:

We now refer to the animals which he created. They are to roam on earth. Some of the animals would be for the purpose of sustenance for the people. From small animal to large animal, the purpose is that people benefit from them. It is thankful that we still see the animals roaming on earth for our benefit. We are thankful that his creation still continues.

Food is the next to be mentioned:

We now refer to our food, which he has planted on earth for our benefit. It was his intention when he gave his food, that the people will be responsible when they plant the seed. When it grows they shall attend to it, and when it comes into the ripe stage they will gather it and put it away for their sustenance when the weather is changed. It is thankful that this food has been planted for our benefit, and that his creation still continues to this day. [Particular foods will be mentioned here, according to the occasion. For instance, corn, beans, and squash--called the “Three Sisters” and also Dyõnhe[unknown] hgõ (“Our Life Supporters” or “Our Sustenance”)--are all three mentioned at the ceremonies dedicated to the growth and testing of any one of them.]

Water on earth next holds the attention of the speaker:

We now refer to the water which the Great Spirit created when he created the earth. The earth should contain water for the benefit of the people. He made springs and streams and also the large bodies of water for the sole purpose that the people will benefit therefrom. So we now unite our minds to combine with the whole creation of the universe of our Mother Earth. We give thanks that all his creations still continue to this time. That is the number of words toward our Mother Earth. [At times fish may be inserted in the water section and mentioned as “traveling under the water,” though Speck (1949:30) lists fish before the forest. Speck also lists fire above water in the hierarchy, though Mr. General usually seems to omit fire, unless a very long version of the Address is given.]

Hereafter, the speaker turns his attention to the spirit forces above the earth. The Thunders are mentioned first and are designated as “Our Granfdathers” (ethi[unknown] hsot hadiweno[unknown] dagye??s). They are the heavenly counterparts of “Our Grandfathers,” the False Faces (ethi[unknown] hsot hena[unknown] d??ui), who are relegated to the earthly sphere. Probably because many of the same traits are associated with the Thunderers and with the False Face Spirits, the two are viewed as manifestations, each in their respective realm, of identical spirits. One informant explained: “Our Maker has Thunder working, and Thunder never comes down to the people; while on earth, for the people, the False Face is working, and the False Face never goes up to heaven.” Some of the identical traits of the Thunderers and the False Faces are that both are offered tobacco, both control windstorms, both are pictured as “old men” and are addressed as “Our Grandfathers,” and both may cause disease and are the recipients of feasts. When one hears a clap of thunder, one should drop a pinch of Indian tobacco into the fire, to thank the Thunderers that they are heard once again traveling through the country. The tobacco helps send the human voice to the Thunderers, and is also pleasing as a gift. In summertime, when it is inconvenient to build a fire, the tobacco may be put on a stump outside. The invocation to Thunder is as follows:

We now refer to the spirit of Thunder, which the Great Spirit had ordained. He [Great spirit] has four appointees for the purpose of enforcing his duty to the creations of the universe. The duty of the Thunderers is to bring water to moisten the earth so all his plantations will grow. Even as the water refreshens we realize at this time, since the change in the weather, that they [Thunderers] still are continuing in their duty. It is thankful that their duty is still being continued to this day. We now unite our minds to thank the spirit of Thunder.

Then other spirit forces of the Lower Pantheon are enumerated:

We now refer to Our Grandmother, the Moon. When he appointed her, he gave her the power to travel above where people could see her when there is darkness upon the earth. It was his intention when he appointed her that the people on earth would regulate their minds to know the number of days of the season, and also he has given her power to help force the growth of his plantation on earth. He has also given her power to control the birth of our children. So we realize, we see that she is still carrying on her duty to this day. We now unite our minds to give thanks to Our Grandmother, the Moon. [A reference to the stars may be combined with the section on the moon, though Mr. General usually gives a short version of this section which does not mention the stars. Speck (1949:30) lists stars immediately below Thunder in the hierarchy.]

We now refer to our Great Brother, the Sun, who is our eldest brother. He was appointed to give light on earth. He (the Great Spirit) also gave him the power to warm the earth, so that his plantation will germinate. We see that he is doing his duty to this day, so we now unite our minds to express thanks to Our Brother, the Sun, that he is still carrying out his duty according to what he was appointed for by the Great Spirit.

Mr. General now turns to the Upper Pantheon, which consists of the supernatural and cosmological forces of the heavenly sphere. This section shows Christian influence more than any of the others, partly due to the Christian orientation of Handsome Lake and the Code, and partly due to the idiosyncrasies of the Sour Springs community, which attributes to Handsome Lake a particularly Christian origin. The first spirits mentioned are the Four Angels, or Dwellers of Heaven, appointed by the Great Creator to regulate the force of the winds. Speck (1949: 30-1) actually identifies them as Winds, but I could not corroborate this interpretation. Informants insist that “Angels are just like persons according to Handsome Lake,” and they have no other connection with the wind than that they regulate the wind's velocity. However, this does not preclude a different, pre-Handsome Lake interpretation of them as Wind Spirits, particularly since four is the pattern number, and the wind is much feared in many contexts. Some informants also feel that the Angels should be mentioned above Handsome Lake, “good as he was,” because they are not really people, as Handsome Lake explained, but stronger powers, and higher than Handsome Lake. Mr. General's version of this section of the Address is the following:

We now refer to his appointees, the Four People, who are Dwellers of Heaven. He has appointed them for the purpose of guarding the people on earth. As we realize that we are subject to being overtaken by misfortune at any moment, it is their duty to safeguard us in our everyday life. We also understand according to the message that we have received that they are within hearing of what we say. [The belief is that “the Four Angels watch all the time, and hear if one talks and whispers, every hour, minute, and second.”] He [the Great Creator] has also given them power to regulate the current of wind to prevent causing injury to the people on earth. If the wind becomes too strong, the people on earth will suffer an injury, so it is their place to safeguard the current of wind. So we now unite our minds to give thanks to his appointees, the Four Dwellers of Heaven. So this will be in our minds, all those that are now present.

Handsome Lake is introduced next and is described in terms which show the influence of Christianity.

We now refer to what has happened in later days. One of our own kind, Handsome Lake, was given the duty to preach to his people the wishes of the Great Spirit, which the angels had delivered to him. These are the words of the Great Spirit as to how the people should care for themselves. We understand that he had fulfilled these wishes during the time he preached to the people of the Longhouses, and we understand according to the Message of the Great Spirit delivered by him that those who will fulfill their duty shall receive a reward from the Great Spirit. When they depart from this world, they shall enter a place in heaven where the immortal souls will enjoy the hereafter. We now unite our minds to give thanks for the Message we have heard from his preaching, and we have no doubt that he has entered into heaven. Let this be in our minds, those that are now present.

Finally, the Great Creator is addressed, as the most revered, oldest, and most powerful of spirits, and again the influence of Christianity is evident. Mr. General says he never heard anyone explain the essence or substance of the Great Spirit. “We are the image of the Great Spirit, says Handsome Lake. I don't know why, it is too deep. We think of him as of parents; that's all there is to it.” Another informant says: “Long ago people got help from Our Maker by supernatural powers, but because we don't trust and believe Our Maker we lose the power. We are also losing the power because we don't believe Handsome Lake as they used to. We read the Bible, which is an ‘earthly’ thing, and not from the Great Creator straight.” One notices an amalgamation of ideas: the very Iroquoian ideas of “receiving power” from the spirit forces, including even the Great Creator, and of the hierarchal spheres; and the Christian concept of having “faith.” Mr. General's invocation is as follows:

We now refer to the Creator of the universe, who has given us the mercy (hodenida[unknown] õnthra??) where the immortal soul will rest and enjoy hereafter, provided that we abide by his commandments. We now give thanks to the Great Spirit, that he has spared us to this day. Let this be in our minds, those that are now present.

One must not underestimate the importance of this Address, for the form and content are repeated by the speakers with near monotony. Each of the items is a familiar entity of the culture, which has been anthropomorphized and which demands respectful and “appropriate” conduct from the speaker. Furthermore, the Address is interpreted very literally, so that any query concerning the items mentioned will be answered by quoting the text of the Address. Conversely, any trait which occurs in the culture and is mentioned in the text, is justified from this text. Thus, for example, children are conceived in relation to the moon, “because it says so in the Thanksgiving Address and Our Maker made it so.”

Furthermore, the formula used in the Thanksgiving Address, namely, mention of the item, note of its duty, recognition that the duty is still being performed, thanks for the fulfillment of this obligation by the item, and indication that some reciprocal action and recognition has been extended and will be extended, is also applied to countless cultural items not customarily included in the Thanksgiving Address. Thus, tobacco, wampum, the False Faces, and the animals of the animal societies are invoked and addressed in the same manner. Analogizing from one situation to another is a basic cultural mechanism among the Iroquois. When in doubt about the handling of any situation, one should always copy an analogous one and explain this to the spirit involved. Since each natural phenomenon is anthropomorphized and pictured as being created by the Creator with a certain duty and usefulness to man (if man only knew how to employ the item, or if man could only remember how to use the item beneficially), it is appropriate to use the same forms of supplication to all of them. The only crucial difference between phenomena is that some are more “particular,” i.e., more dangerous and powerful, than others, and therefore must be accorded especially careful and respectful attention. As long as one renders unto the False Faces the things which are the False Faces' and to each spirit force the things which are his, man can live in harmony with the universe. Man cannot really control any of the spirit forces, but if they are acknowledged and thanked and treated with respect, even as the Thanksgiving Address indicates, then man need not fear, but can be assured of their assistance. The Great Creator is conceived of as especially benevolent, for the Thanksgiving Address repeatedly mentions that many of his creations are expressly intended to help mankind. In all relations with the universe, there is the element of mutual obligation and assistance between man and the Creator and the things which were made by the Creator, even as there is between moieties, between ritual friends, and among members of a family.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual296,Funeral,"Death of a Common Member

Introduction. The Ohgi[unknown] we is the only ceremony dedicated to all the dead of the nation collectively, and the rest of the observances discussed here concern either an individual dead person or, at most, a designated group of dead. But whether attention is focused on the collective or the individual dead, the attitude of the Longhouse members remains consistently respectful and careful. A single dead person must be treated just as “particularly” as the host of ancestors who intermingle with the performers at a community Ohgi[unknown] we. Consequently, funeral customs are of major importance to the Longhouse members.

Any occurrence of death must be recognized ceremonially, but that of a chief or of a close uterine relative of a chief involves a more complicated condolence ceremony than that of an ordinary person. Therefore, the death of a common member of the Longhouse will be treated first, and then the additional rites for a chief will be briefly discussed.

Preparation for death. Although death may strike a person unexpectedly at any time, particularly since it is widely thought to be predestined, relatives and friends are often given indications of an approaching death. Such a sign, which is, however, not a causative factor in the death, may come either in a dream or through a culturally recognized omen. The most common of the omens is a bird, which travels swiftly to foretell disaster, though often a bird simply brings a message, and one cannot tell whether it is good or bad until the presaged event occurs. An owl seen or heard, a whippoorwill near one's house, a wild pigeon flying into the house, a woodpecker pecking at the house, a bird flying into a window pane, or a hen crowing like a rooster--all may presage death.

Mrs. George Green was warned twice by wild pigeons that someone would die. One day while she was sitting at the table eating, a dove flew into the dining room under Mrs. Green's chair and then flopped under the chair of her mother as if dead. When they got up to catch the bird, it flew out the door. One week later Mrs. Green's mother was dead, though she had been very well. (She was, however, quite old at the time.) On another occasion a dove flew into the tree in front of her house, and she had her husband chase it. Less than an hour later a man bore the news that the shopkeeper at Johnson's store had died. “The bird had come straight, first to give the message.”

Owls in particular are so feared that it is best not even to mention them in an ordinary conversation; talking freely of them would be foolhardy and would tempt fate. The appearance of ghosts, lights, skeletons, or snakes on the path, as well as numerous other folkloristic symbols, also may mean the imminence of a death.

One informant saw a light on the ceiling and a skeleton at the foot of her bed one night, but for fear that the ghost might hear her speaking she did not awaken her husband to tell him. Suddenly, three days later, her mother's father who was more than eighty years old, died of heart trouble. She thought that the ghost had been an omen. Another informant heard the stairs creaking one night, and the next morning she learned that a relative who had lived with her as a child had been killed at a stone quarry. She took the creaking as having been a sign of the approaching death, for “the relative came to her once more.”

Since the omen gives no indication of who the doomed person may be, nothing can be done but feel fear.

It is always to be hoped that one will be so fortunate as to die in one's own home, and death in a foreign land is considered punishment for past sins or an evil life. Debates often arise in the council about whether the band should pay for the transportation of the corpse to the Reserve for burial, for there is a strong feeling, shared even by Christians, that “the body should be brought home.” To ameliorate the misfortune of death away from home, Indian tobacco is sometimes sprinkled on the spot where a person died by accident. Versions of the Code mention that the faithful shall die in their sleep, and the fact that Handsome Lake did not do so is at times adduced to show that he was an impostor (see Parker, 1913:59, for a similar statement).

If a person is at home and death is imminent, he should confess his sins, particularly any associated with witchcraft or the use of “medicines” for illicit purposes (such as a lacrosse or snow-snake game), for should the person hide these, he would die a “hard” death.

After confession, the “dead clothes,” which everyone ought to have ready at all times, should be hung in sight of the ailing person above the bed. If he has been unable to prepare his own dead clothes, help in preparing them should be sought from a member of the opposite moiety. The dead clothes of a woman consist of a white cotton undershirt, a cotton half slip with a drawstring, black or navy wool broadcloth leggings, a skirt of the same material, two printed colonial-style cotton dresses (so that the dead may have a change of clothing, though the dresses are worn one on top of the other), a neckerchief, a ribbon belt, a ribbon to tie the hair (or to be placed in the coffin in case the person's hair is too short to be tied), and a pair of “dead moccasins.”

A dead moccasin is cut with a seam up the center front rather than with a tongue inset over the top of the foot as in the common moccasin worn during one's lifetime. Also, the shiny side of the deerskin is turned outward in the dead moccasin and inward in the ordinary moccasin. At one time the men's and women's designs differed, but today, when only a few people remember how to make a moccasin, the same pattern is used for both sexes. Mrs. George Green, who makes dead moccasins, will do so without charge if the deerskin is provided; otherwise she will charge $2.00, as compared to a charge of $5.00 for making an ordinary pair. The moccasins have no decoration and are tied.

All the cloth must be sewn, and no buttons or pins are to be used at all. Not only are the latter considered to be white man's goods, but a pin, being made of metal, is said to weigh down the soul so that it would be earth bound and unable to ascend to heaven. Nor must any of the clothing be decorated with beads, for they also are “too heavy” and would confine the soul to the earth. Decorations of ribbons (which are essential items in any “Indian” wardrobe and are deemed to be the truly Indian decoration) and embroidery are permissible, but neither the material nor the decoration should be brightly colored. In particular, nothing of a red color should ever be put on a dead person, although pinks are perfectly acceptable.

The funeral wardrobe of a man consists of an undershirt; a breechcloth; leggings, slit on the outside, trimmed with ribbons, and sometimes tied to a belt at the waist; an overshirt of patterned print cotton reaching to just above the knees; arm-band ribbons which are tied above the elbow; leg-band ribbons tied below the knee (though in the “down-below” communities the leg bands are sometimes omitted); a long ribbon which is draped over the left shoulder, brought down and crossed over the right hip, and tied in a bow at the left hip, so that the ends hang down from the waist; a silk neckerchief folded into a triangle and knotted in front; a scarf bound about the head and also tied at the left side, with the ends hanging down; and moccasins. The same strictures concerning color and decoration apply to men as to women. The reason why all items are tied at the left is that “when one gets to heaven the dancing is always clockwise, or toward the left, and the sash knot and ends should always hang on the outside of the dance circle.” Here is another instance of the “dead going around to the left”; and the Skin Dance and Feather Dance in particular are danced clockwise in heaven. Also interesting is the conception that in heaven the soul has the same form as the fully dressed body.

A generation ago the failing person would be dressed just before he died, but now he need only be able to look at his prepared clothes as he dies. Seeing them hanging neatly above one's head is supposed to give a feeling of security and reassurance that one is “ready to go.” The fact that most people are not so prepared causes Mrs. George Green to comment: “We different now, just like a cat would die now.”

The wake. Once dead, the body should not be left alone in the house for even a minute. A messenger should be engaged, from the moiety opposite to that of the deceased, who should fetch helpers to bathe and dress the corpse. Sometimes the mourners themselves perform these tasks, but strictly no members of the family of the deceased should perform these duties, and members of the moiety opposite to that of the deceased should be called in for this purpose. When the dressing is completed, three “hollers” should be given, and the corpse should be placed so that his head lies to the west. Canadian law now requires that the corpse be embalmed, and therefore an undertaker is called to take the body and to return it in time for the wake. Sometimes all the preparations of the dead, including dressing in Indian clothes, are performed by the undertaker. Traditionally, a plain pine box was ordered from the casket maker on the Reserve, but today the undertaker sometimes supplies a modern coffin. A v-slit is made at the head of the pine box in order to allow the soul to escape. When a metal casket is used, a symbolic knife scratch suffices.

Jake Henry, Howard Johnson, and Bob Martin were notable casket makers, and even today a few families order a box from Jake Henry to be delivered to Mr. Styres, the Six Nations undertaker. These home-made caskets had no nails or other metal parts and were mainly undecorated. The coffin maker, too, should ideally belong to the moiety opposite to that of the deceased. However, the tendency today is to sell “fancy” coffins to all the Reserve, including the Longhouse members, despite the fact that they are not considered proper. Social prestige has become an important factor in matters of burial, and often a burial will cost several hundred dollars. The benevolent societies (see p. 000 supra ) will pay $100 of the cost, while the rest is borne by the family and often is owed to the funeral director for years. Not long ago all funeral expenses were paid in yards of material (three to five yards to each person who rendered services), but modern economic conditions have practically eliminated this.

The soul usually does not leave this earth, and perhaps not even the body, until after the tenth-day feast, and consequently the dead should not be left alone, particularly not until the funeral day. The family stays at home during the day, and friends and relatives are invited to the wake for the night. Wakes are held the first or second night after death, and in order to indicate particular love and respect for the dead they may be held both nights. The messenger who “tells around” of the death also invites members to the wake, saying, “You are requested to come to keep the light lit.” He also procures the equipment (kept by a designated member of each Longhouse) and the caretaker, or helper (hadyenawa[unknown] se), to run the wake, if he does not act as the caretaker himself. Also, in preparation for a wake, the family should hire two cooks of the moiety opposite to that of the deceased to prepare the “midnight lunch,” which is served both to the mourners at the wake and to the deceased. Since the soul of the dead is on earth for at least ten days, the dead person must be treated as if he were still alive. Food must be served him; a place for him must be set at the table; and all the speeches must be phrased as if the person were still among the assembled ones. Should the deceased be carried in or out of the room or the Longhouse, it should always be done feet first, “as if he were walking in.”

Although a wake ought to be held for any person who dies, including a baby “who has uttered one cry” (i.e., was not stillborn), it is not one of the indispensable observances. Since the particular game now played at a wake was borrowed from the Delaware, the omission of a wake is usually rationalized by saying, “Well, it's Delaware, it is not Iroquois.” Wakes are not held on reservations in the United States, and, consequently, when a member from a United States reservation dies in Canada, he may be buried without a wake.

When the mourners arrive for the wake, around 10:00 P.M., they hand the food which they are contributing to the caretaker and then either seat themselves in a circle around the room, or, if they expect to participate in the wake game, in two rows of chairs arranged facing each other. At one time the two moieties played against each other, but today moiety seating is not observed in the game. The immediate family is always absent from the wake until the final song in the morning. Close relatives are defined as “those in the same house.” This means the relatives in the same matrilineal family as the deceased, and also those who physically live in the house with the deceased, such as a spouse (although the attendance of a spouse is optional). The close relatives should not take part in the wake, because they should be “in darkness and grieving,” and “it would look funny to see people enjoy themselves” (i.e., at the wake games). The close relatives of the deceased should keep silent as much as possible.

The body is kept in the room, head to the west, in the open coffin, and the mourners may get up to pay their respects and have a final look. Lately, however, some wakes are held at home, while the body remains at the funeral parlor, and this is not believed to affect the efficacy of the wake, nor is the procedure changed.

After most of the mourners have assembled, a shortened version of the Thanks-giving Address, directed mainly toward the Great Creator, opens the observances. It is followed by a condolence speech to the mourners, delivered by any competent speaker. Wake speeches are not highly patterned and standardized, and consequently various speakers are noted for their individualistic style of address. Dave Thomas is said to give emotional speeches designed to make the mourners cry; Bill Thomas, Pat Longboat, and Jack General give much more conventional, constrained speeches in the manner of the Longhouse orations. Jack General's version is as follows:

It is our duty to come and help the mourners, the people that have sustained the loss of their beloved one. We would ask the mourners not to grieve and not to feel too severe for the loss we have sustained. For we know that the Great Spirit, our Creator, has not given us perpetual life. We all have suffered more or less the same of our beloved ones, and therefore we should sympathize with the people that have suffered this loss of their beloved one, so that they will not grieve too seriously. And they have asked us to come to keep a wake until day breaks. We therefore ask you, who are now assembled, that you will carry on this wake in a respectful manner, within the house and around the outside. Then we now begin the rite to keep ourselves awake.

After the speech the wake game is played. At one time this was the Bowl Game played with deer buttons and later with peach pits, but today a Delaware gambling game is substituted. Informants on the Reserve still remember when the Iroquoian Bowl Game was played, so that the Delaware “mitt-and-stick” gambling game is a rather recent innovation. John Beaver, the uncle of Joseph Isaac (who himself died in 1920), died in Delaware territory on the Reserve probably around the turn of the century, and his body was kept by the Delaware, who played the “mitt game” during the wake. It was after his death that the “mitt gambling game” is said to have spread to all the wake observances on the Reserve. The songs which accompany the game are also borrowed from the Delaware, and Iroquoian performers are not able to understand the meanings of the songs, though they do not consist of burden syllables only.

Each wake is “run” (supervised) by an appointed helper, who is in charge of the progress of the game. The rules vary from occasion to occasion, depending upon who “runs” the wake and how the scorekeepers have been taught to keep score. Neither the exact rules nor even the outcome of the game is essential to the proceedings, since the purpose of the game is simply to assist in staying awake all night. However, the general pattern is unmistakable, and the songs are easily recognized. The wake game is played between two teams, which consist of an arbitrary number of people of either sex. At one time the teams reflected the moiety organization, but lately this has been neglected. The game is a kind of hide-and-seek, a version of the common moccasin game of North America. One side hides a small object in one of four moccasins (or socks, mittens, gloves, or a combination of these articles) placed on the floor between the two rows of players. Members of the opposite side try to guess the location of the hidden object, each in turn pointing with a pointer stick to the moccasin which he believes contains the hidden object. When the object is found, the side of the successful searcher becomes the hider, and the side which previously hid the object becomes the searching side.

At Sour Springs the permanent wake paraphernalia consist of six small ball bearings used as counters and one larger ball bearing which is the object hidden in the gloves and moccasins. Edric General keeps these for the community, and he lends them to any family which needs them. The 3-inch wooden counters, 50 for the death of a child, 100 for the death of an adult, are fashioned just before each wake by the wake official, as are the large pointer stick and the drumstick used in the drum accompaniment of the wake songs. These items must be fashioned anew for each occurrence because they must be burned in the morning in the final stages of the game. The family sponsoring the wake provides the moccasins and the mats (or blankets) under which the counter sticks are placed when won by a side. The drum may be borrowed from anyone, whether a relative or not. Incidentally, Fenton (1950: 35-6) mentions a “cane with a crook for use in the Moccasin game at a chief's wake,” collected by Hewitt in 1916, but at Six Nations there was no evidence of a mnemonic cane. The only cane was the rude pointer stick, fashioned from any ordinary branch and burned at the end of the ceremony. It is said that at one time the instruments used to accompany the wake songs were a notched and an unnotched stick (rasping sticks), but today the Delaware and the Iroquoian singers at Six Nations all use the drum (see Conklin and Sturtevant, 1953: 286).

The details of the game are as follows: Two persons, one from each team, “choose up” by placing hand over hand on the pointer stick, and the side whose representative comes out “hand on top” is the first side to seek. Four songs initiate the game. A member of the losing team then hides a ball bearing under or in one of the moccasins and chooses a wake song. He may sing any one of 30 songs now remembered, and as soon as the song is recognized, the entire hiding side helps to sing, while a drummer on the hiding side accompanies the song. There is no order of choice, and often the same song is repeated time after time, especially when the participants are not versed in many of the songs. Approximately two dozen different wake songs are remembered by one of the singers. This is probably as large a set as any one person knows today; most performers know only two or three. The song continues over and over until the seeking side has successfully located the hidden object, at which point the song is broken off abruptly. The members of the seeking side take turns at guessing, but the ball bearing is hid anew by the same hider after each guess. When a person guesses incorrectly, he passes the pointer stick to his neighbor. When there is a correct guess, the hider indicates the success by hitting the moccasin on the floor, so that the object makes a loud sound. At this point the teams switch roles: the drum and ball bearing are handed to the new hiding side, the pointer stick is given to the new seeking side, and the whole procedure of hide-and-seek is repeated. The new hider is the neighbor to the right of the last person to hide on his team, and the new seeker is the neighbor to the left of the last person to guess on his team. The drum is passed to the neighbor on the left if he can play it, otherwise it tends to be held by the head of the side. There are two scorekeepers, one for each side, who sit at the head of the two rows of players and move the counters according to the guesses of the seekers. At the beginning of the game, all the counters are in a pool. As the game progresses, according to Jack General's set of rules, a ball bearing is laid aside each time a seeker misses, and when six of these have been moved to one side, representing six consecutive misses, a counter is awarded to the hiding side from the pool. After the pool is exhausted, counter sticks are transferred from one side to the other; in this respect, the rules of the wake game resemble those of the bowl game (see p. 171 supra ). Because winning is unimportant, there is considerable individual variation in the details of scoring, depending upon the individual scorekeepers, and at times the scorekeeper may even get tired of “moving the sticks,” and scoring is ignored. Even though the game is strictly intended only to pass time and to keep the mourners awake, there is often some cheating. Hiders keep the marble in their hands or up their sleeves, and scorekeepers attempt to favor their own side. At a wake sponsored by a family belonging to Lower Cayuga Longhouse, the scorekeeper apparently awarded the hiding side a wooden counter each time the seeking side missed, and awarded the seeking side a counter when the hidden object was located. There were no auxiliary counters, such as the ball bearings, in evidence. In all the communities the purpose of the game is merely to help to stay awake, so that when all the counters are won by one team, they are simply placed in the pool again, and the game is resumed. Often, however, a whole night passes without a side ever amassing all the counters. The game continues uninterruptedly until midnight, at which time the speaker announces that there will be a small rest. “Lunch” is served, including a plate for the deceased. The food consists of ordinary home-made feast fare for which no special preparation is prescribed. After the “lunch,” the speaker announces that “we will now proceed where we left off, we will carry on till day breaks.” All the counters are again placed in a common pool, and the game continues as before, although with only three moccasins.

Toward morning, just as dawn appears, all inhabitants of the house must be awakened, and both sides sing the “cry (or crier) song” (dewashethwa[unknown] ?tha?). During this song only two people play the game, using only two moccasins, and each time a person misses, a wooden counter stick is burned in the stove by the wake official. However, because it is believed that a death will occur within the family in that very year if the “cry song” lasts a long time, the official will burn several sticks at a time to shorten the game. (Down below, if the deceased is a woman, two women play; and if a man, two men play during this last song, alternately hiding and searching.) Both squat on the floor over the moccasins, and since the game is fast and intimate, no pointer stick is used. When all the counter sticks have been burned, the pointer stick is broken in two and also burned, and then the drumstick. At one time a gun was shot off in the morning, but this has now been discontinued. The “skin” head is then taken off the drum, and is “put up” (stored in the house in a safe place) until the tenth-day feast, whereupon it is returned to the owner and may be used again. Of course, if the wake is repeated the second night, the skin is replaced and the drum “tuned up” for the second wake, but thereafter it is kept until “freed” at the tenth-day feast.

All the inhabitants of the house must be aroused for the “cry song,” and all the participants must be awake, for the deceased is close by and is dangerous to any-one sleeping. During this song all participants, and particularly the mourners, weep bitterly, for it marks the departure of the deceased. The speaker once more gives the Thanksgiving Address in brief form. Again only the sections which are dedicated to the Great Creator and which give thanks for the privilege of the assembly and health of the participants are used. If the funeral time has been set, the date is mentioned, and the participants are asked to communicate the information to whoever may ask. Once more there is stress on wide community participation. Should food remain from the lunch, it is either passed to the participants or served to them “on the table,” or both (see p. 247 infra ).

The guests leave, and the family takes over the deathwatch. The food which was served to the dead, and from which the dead is believed to have extracted the essence, is given to the first visitor who arrives in the morning or to a strager or to a “poor” person, or it is simply discarded (given to a dog, buried, or thrown into a swamp). A dead person should participate in all meals served in the house from death until the tenth-day feast. No other person may occupy the accustomed place at the table of the deceased in the interval. However, food need be placed on the plate only as long as the corpse is in the house and at the tenth-day feast.

Burial. At one time Iroquois burial was a scaffold, or tree, burial, or simply an abandonment of the corpse in a shack, and numerous folk tales still discuss this type of disposal. For example, see Randle (1953:632), who also notes that Waugh included five versions of “The Vampire Corpse” in his Six Nations collection. Today, however, the only method of disposing of corpses is grave burial, and the popular story, “The Vampire Corpse,” is related at Six Nations to indicate that this is the only proper type of burial.

Mrs. George Green and others related the story much as it was told to Waugh in 1915 ( ibid.: 632):A family had lived in a lodge, and when a death occurred, the dead person was left while the remaining members stole away silently, abandoning the entire hut. Later these members or others in the community were led back to the lodge where either they were attacked by a vampire, or the old corpse was found “eaten out in the stomach” or “with blood on the face.” The explanation is that this was the work of the dead who were not buried, or that wolves had reached the dead because they were not buried. In either case a discussion of burial method follows, with the conclusion that henceforth the dead should be interred rather than left in an abandoned house or given a scaffold burial.

The grave should be dug by a fellow member of the deceased's Longhouse, but one who is preferably of the opposite moiety. The grave must not be dug earlier than the morning of the interment, for an open grave is disrespectful to the dead, in that it might imply that the mourners are eager to be rid of the corpse. According to the “Indian way,” says Mrs. Green, one is supposed to “hold on to the dead and keep them with us as long as possible.” Consequently, the very last thing to do is to dig the grave. Furthermore, a grave left open overnight is believed to cause another death in the family. For example, a few years ago a woman was buried at St. Johns with Christian rites, and the grave was prepared the day before burial. One week after her death two of her grandchildren became extremely ill (in a coma), which her husband attributed to the opened grave. “They did wrong by the old Indian belief,” he said, although he is a very acculturated Christian Indian and a high-steel construction worker in the United States most of the time.

On the morning of the funeral the corpse is provided with a “lunch” consisting of corn bread 2 inches in diameter, which has been baked in ashes (“the dead people's way”) rather than cooked in water. (This type of corn bread may also be eaten as a delicacy; see Parker, 1910:68.) No beans or salt are ever added. This corn bread is wrapped in a handkerchief and placed in the hand or elbow joint of the deceased to be eaten on his journey. (Church people sometimes place oranges in the coffin of the deceased as the “lunch.” Although this is not considered proper by the Longhouse population, it is an understandable substitution, since oranges are expensive and highly valued at Six Nations.) Furthermore, many of the smaller personal, ceremonial, or medicinal artifacts which were made specifically for the welfare of the individual, or which passed to the individual in connection with a supernatural decree or through the instructions of a fortuneteller, should preferably be buried with the individual, and should be placed in the coffin as inconspicuously as possible (under the body, for example). Thus, the stick used in the medicinal tug-of-war game, the football used in the football game, the eagle wand, the snow snake from a medicinal snow-snake game, and the miniature False Face masks from dream guessing are typical objects which should accompany the deceased in death just as they did during his life.

Speck (1949:123) mentions that in one case the miniature mask was buried with the dreamer. This ought to be done in all cases. Thus, a curing rite was required for a grandaughter (SoDa), because a miniature mask had not been buried with her grandmother. The circumstances were as follows: The grandmother and her sister had identical dreams that there was a deep gully, and there was water in this gully. It was a windy day, and a False Face and a Husk Face helped both to avoid falling into the gully. This dream was “looked into” at Midwinter and duly guessed, whereupon two miniature masks were made. The grandmother kept both of them in a little sack, but when the grandmother died, her little mask was not “taken along.” This, a fortuneteller diagnosed, caused the misfortune and made the granddaughter have fainting spells. (Note that the illness affected a son's child, who is not in the matrilineal line of descent. It is characteristic of medicine or charms that they work on both sides of the family.) A long and elaborate feast was held for both small masks, in which the entire history of the case was recited, the masks were asked for forgiveness, tobacco was burned, tobacco was tied to both masks, and False Face and Husk Face songs were performed by masked performers. The food served was False Face mush, roasted for a black miniature mask; and also “dead” corn bread, because a Husk Face likes corn bread and because the owner of the Husk Face was dead, and with a dead person one buries corn bread baked in ashes. It was further promised that one miniature mask would be buried with the grandaunt, and one with the sick girl. However, the grandaunt once again took both masks home with her. The procedure and program of the entire ceremony had been carefully delineated by the fortuneteller.

False Faces and Husk Faces, as well as the musical instruments of the curing societies, are not deemed proper objects to accompany the dead, even though the person may have acquired these in the same manner as an eagle wand. These objects must be disposed of at the tenth-day feast, where they should be given to a suitable heir who can use them “properly.” Simply “keeping” them will bring disease and bad luck to the hoarder, even if he is a legitimate heir, such as a child of a deceased woman. Hunting charms should also be buried with the dead who once owned them, and, indeed, burial with the owner is one of the “safest” methods of disposing of charms and medicinal objects. If such burial should fail to take place--and despite the potential dangers, relatives often refuse to give up the objects, because “they are stingy of them”--the family can reasonably expect some illness and poor luck from the presence and improper care of these objects. Similarly, if the deceased had been an herbal curer, all his or her “medicines” should be buried separately in the earth. They may be dug up again after the ten-day mourning period and used by another specialist, if he is sure of the proper usage. However, by far the safest course is to bury the medicine and leave it buried, because “it might be dangerous” after the rightful owner has died. Medicines are individualistic and dangerous, and might work only for the “doctor” who originally owned them and knew how to use them. But in this case, too, relatives are loath to discard a useful material, and some keep the medicines and merely purify them by smoking them with pine branches and the burnt root of skwa[unknown] eda (coltsfoot), after the tenth-day feast. Occasionally, an individual will express a wish to “take along” his favorite snow snake or walking stick, and such desires are granted. However, no informant at Six Nations could remember seeing any wampum in a coffin, as has been reported in the literature and is found in archeological excavations.

A meal is usually served at noon to the gravediggers and mourners. Then, before setting out for the final Longhouse rites a speaker, belonging preferably to the home Longhouse of the deceased but to the opposite moiety, usually comes to the house of the deceased and once more consoles the family and mourners in a formal address. If a competent speaker of the opposite moiety is not available, a speaker must be borrowed from the moiety of the deceased. Such a speaker acts as a “two-faced,” and he is returned to his own moiety with thanks (see p. 48 supra ). The spouse, children, ritual friends, kheya[unknown] ?dawheh, agadõ[unknown] nih, and other mourners are condoled in that order in much the same words as at the wake. Then the procession to the Longhouse begins.

At Sour Springs the body is carried in and out through the women's door, while at Lower Cayuga and Seneca the east door is used for the entrance and the west for the exit. In all cases the foot end of the coffin is carried in first to simulate “walking” into the Longhouse, as if the person were “still with us.” The coffin is opened and placed in the center of the house on the singers' benches, the head westward and the feet eastward. At one time there was such emphasis on verisimilitude and “being with us still” that the undertaker was compelled to unscrew the entire lid of the coffin at the wake and at the Longhouse, so that it looked as if the person were reclining on a couch. Lately, however, the undertaker has been relieved of this chore at most of the funerals.

Seating for a funeral is according to sex. A second condolence address is given by the speaker who had consoled the bereaved at home earlier. He says that perhaps some relatives had not heard the words expressed at the house, and therefore he condoles them again. Furthermore, he condoles the entire moiety of the bereaved, specifying as usual each of the ranks in the hierarchy: the deacons, the people, the children, and those on cradleboards. If the deceased belonged to a title-owning family, the chief of that family is particularly condoled. Then, the moiety of the deceased replies briefly in kind, avowing that the loss undoubtedly affected not them alone but also the condoling side. The speaker then announces that the people may now have a last look at the departed relative. All the speeches are phrased in such a way as to indicate that the deceased is still among the people, passing through the Longhouse a final time on his way to heaven. Going up to the coffin for a last look is considered extremely important, and orthodox members insist that the body must be brought into the Longhouse and must be visible. (This causes friction at times, such as when the undertaker refused to bring a corpse which had been submerged for several months in the Grand River into a Longhouse. The “head push” of the Longhouse protested violently and feared that the soul might therefore be unable to enter heaven.) At Sour Springs the women (“because they are the mothers”) circle the coffin counterclockwise first, followed by the men, and then followed by the family of the deceased, which is not separated by sex. Down below, women circle first if a woman died, men if a man died. After all have circled, the speaker announces that the coffin will be closed and the remains laid to rest. The coffin is carried out feet first, again as if the deceased were walking. Mourners then follow the coffin to the burial ground of the Longhouse, where the speaker delivers the last address. He indicates that now the departed has arrived at the final resting place and henceforth will be entrusted to the Creator. The mourners have done their duty as decreed by the Creator, and they should now release their hands from the dead. Alexander General adds: “We have now returned the remains to earth, which the Creator made to create man by earth. So the remains shall return back to earth.” Mourners are instructed to return to the house of the deceased on the tenth day after death for the tenth-day feast. The coffin is lowered, again with the head to the west, and two shovels of earth are symbolically placed on the lowered coffin by a member of the moiety opposite to that of the deceased. Sometimes a single wreath from the family is added, and the mourners depart. Gravediggers complete the interment. It is generally believed that it will rain if an “old person” dies, “because those left behind are not so sad, as the dead cover up their tracks.” Therefore, if a death occurs, rain is usually forecast for the funeral day.

Until the tenth-day feast there should be a general period of mourning for the entire community of the home Longhouse of the deceased, and no games should be held at that Longhouse.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Ritual297,,"The tenth-day feast and the one-year feast. Wherever the Iroquois culture is verbalized--for example, in the folklore and legends--the expression and repression of excessive grief are familiar motifs. Prolonged displays of despair are depicted as the natural, untutored reaction, which, however, according to the teaching of the culture hero or the new prophet, ought to be tempered and limited to a shortened period. In the legend of the founding of the League, for example, Deganawi[unknown] da? persuaded Hayõ[unknown] hwatha? to moderate his grief by means of wampum strings and the sympathetic recitation of a condoling address (Parker, 1916: 24). Today the Requickening Address restores the bereaved kindred to a normal state and admonishes them to observe a more balanced expression of suffering than the erstwhile tearing of vestments and mutilation of the body. The funeral, tenth-day, one-year, and “giving up” speeches all enjoin the mourner not to dwell on his loss beyond a reasonable measure. Functionally, excessive mourning would interfere with the operation of the culture, and the injunctions to be moderate are sensible, particularly in view of so many tales of grief-induced debility and of the great emphasis on death. The institution of the tenth-day feast is described as an innovation promulgated by Handsome Lake in order to limit the dejection of the mourners. According to Mr. General:

Before Handsome Lake the people mourned continuously and no more forgot the first loss before there would be another death, and the mourning would continue. It caused a troubled mind or suicide. Handsome Lake had a vision that the people should discontinue the mourning after ten days, and if they exceed that time they commit a sin, because it causes them to impair their health. Now the mourners do follow up the advice.

Parker (1913 : 56-7, 108-9) also finds these sentiments in sections of the Code.

The tenth-day feast, therefore, formalizes the conclusion of the period of deep mourning though certain obligations of mourning still remain for the spouse and ritual friends, who abstain from complete social reintegration until they have “given up the dead” at the next appropriate Longhouse ceremony (p. 250 infra ). The obligation of the one-year feast also remains (p. 251 infra ). The tenth-day feast marks the final departure of the dead from the earth, for many believe that the dead person hovers about the vicinity in “ghost” form for ten days after death. “Ghost” form specifically means that the dead, when visible, assume a bodily aspect precisely like that of the living. Many individuals claim that they have at times seen dead persons and that they looked just as they did during their lifetime. The belief in the presence of the dead is so strong that special provisions are made to protect the weaker members of the assemblage. Children in particular are described as “not strong enough” to withstand so much contact with the dead, and consequently precautions must be taken to safeguard them. It is safest to tie a half-inch band of deerskin around the left wrist of a child (often for children up to fifteen years of age, though it is mandatory only for children under four), which the child wears throughout the period of contact with the dead (i.e., at all dead feasts and from death until the tenth-day feast). Once the dead have left, the band, which prevented them from approaching the child, is simply discarded. Should there be no deerskin bands at hand, snipping a small amount of hair from the top or front of the child's head and burning it fulfills the same purpose, because the dead do not like the smell, and sometimes both methods are used simultaneously. Yet another method of safeguarding, particularly for children at the death of their mother, is to sew a snippet of hair of the deceased into a small cloth bag, and to pin this to the clothes of the child during the ten-day mourning period. Not only does this provide the necessary protection, but it is also meant to keep the child from becoming too sad. Another category of people who are represented as “not strong enough” in respect to withstanding the ill effects of the dead are menstruating women, but here the remedy is simply to keep them away from possible contact. Only after the proper “feast” on the tenth day is the dead person able to leave in peace. For this reason the event is considered vital, and the neglect of a tenth-day feast is a dangerous gamble, seldom dared by a Longhouse family. Without the feast the dead would most probably “be bothered” and would be forced “to be around,” which is extremely dangerous to the living, for the chance of contact with the dead is naturally much greater if they are “around” and displeased on account of disrespectful treatment than if they have left for the final journey. Furthermore, the dead are very “particular” about the tenth-day feast, with the result that any neglect of the prescribed event could cause illness and bad luck for generations among the kindred of the dead. Indeed, many of the diseases of Christian families are diagnosed by the Longhouse fortunetellers as stemming directly from the neglect of a tenth-day feast of some relative. Jack General even goes so far as to state that in his opinion more Christian than Longhouse families are forced to pass small dead feasts, which is the common remedy for a neglected tenth-day feast, because the Christians are so unmindful of their obligations to the dead. Mr. General's statement expresses the common attitude rather well:

Neglect of feeding the dead by feasts causes sickness. One must at all times treat the dead with proper respect, so that they do not harm the living. “Indians” put the dead to rest after ten days or a year, with material. The dead are treated as if they were here for ten days and then released, and they are not so vindictive then and do not hurt or afflict the living much. Nor do they come back to make the Indian sick. But Christians don't do this, and therefore they are more bothered and must give more feasts. More Christians give feasts than Longhouse people.

This is an indication of the importance attached to the tenth-day feast, for it is usually a Longhouse fortuneteller who diagnoses the cause of the Christian's illness, and the omission of the tenth-day feast is so obvious a transgression that it is often designated as the cause of an ailment which might easily be ascribed to quite a different cause were a Longhouse patient involved. Of course, if a Longhouse family did neglect a tenth-day feast, there is no doubt that any disease and bad luck in that family would immediately be traced to this indiscretion.

In practice the execution of the tenth-day feast is comparatively simple, with very little need for paraphernalia or specialists. The importance of the event is definitely philosophical and emotional, and the participants emphasize that the event must be observed rather than how elaborately it is to be performed.

A tenth-day feast ought to be arranged by the matrilineal relatives of the deceased, one of whom supervises the feast and is referred to as the “matron.” (This does not mean that she is the custodian of a chief's title.) Usually, she is the sister, mother, mother's sister, or mother's sister's daughter of the deceased. However, if there does happen to be a chief's title in the matrilineal family, then the matron of the chief is often asked to perform the duty, since she is looked upon as the ritually most important member of the family. The matrilineal relatives “hire” the messenger and the cooks and engage the speaker, usually the same people who helped at the wake. The matrilineal relatives should also decide upon the distribution of the estate of the deceased, for a husband or wife is, theoretically, ineligible to participate in the division of either the personal articles or the lands of the dead. In practice, however, only the personal articles of the dead are distributed today by the family at the tenth-day feast, particularly since all land transfers must be approved by the elected council and the Indian Department at Brantford. However, at the more orthodox ceremonies the speaker may mention to whom the lands will eventually be deeded. In preparation for the tenth-day feast, the personal effects are bundled and tied by the matrilineal relatives into separate packages, ready to be bestowed upon the helpers, “hired” personnel, friends, and heirs, and these packages are readily visible to the visitors.

Theoretically, all the members of the Longhouse community are invited, as are all the relatives of the deceased, but in fact only those people who knew the deceased and the family well or who aided in the funeral proceedings attend. In general, those who go to the funeral also go to the tenth-day feast, particularly since an invitation to the tenth-day feast is automatically extended at the grave to all funeral participants by the speaker. Those who attend usually contribute to the “feast” for the dead by bringing baskets of edibles, but contributions are not mandatory. The two cooks hired by the matrilineal relatives of the deceased help them prepare the doughnuts, scones, pies, cookies, corn soup, and other feast foods. In the Sour Springs community the visitors are first given a meal “on the table,” which means that each person sits at the table for a complete meal of corn soup and any other foods the family may be able to afford. As soon as a person has finished eating, he rises and takes his seat somewhere else in the room, and his place is filled, at the instruction of one of the cooks, by another visitor. There is very little, if any, conversation during the feasting, and all participants are reverent and solemn. Throughout the meal a place has also been set for the deceased and provided with a normal portion of food, which is kept until the next morning, when it is either given away or disposed of. The extra place setting for the deceased constitutes “feeding the dead,” and it is the crucial trait of the “feasting-the-dead” pattern. The dead are always described as “being hungry,” and keeping the food overnight gives them a good chance to absorb the essence of the nourishments. In the communities down below the “feasting” at the tenth-day feast is confined to the passing of food at the end of the distributory ceremonies of the occasion, but here, too, the deceased accumulates his share of the food, which is also kept until morning.

A definite distinction is always drawn between eating “on the table” and merely “passing food,” even though the actual food may be identical. The two traits are conceptually very different to the participants, and eating “on the table” is considered a more formal and solemn observance. Since the average family can accommodate at most eight or ten people at one time at their table, the procedure often takes several hours. A notable trait of the entire “feasting-the-dead” pattern is that, at all times, the living must also be given the appropriate food for the particular dead feast. The mere offering of food to the ghosts of the deceased does not constitute “feeding the dead.”

The matron who runs the tenth-day feast indicates to the speaker that he should begin the formalities of the occasion. A speaker should never, out of respect to the family, be a member of the family, and preferably he should belong to the moiety opposite to that of the deceased. If the deceased was married, the speaker will explain that the first attention must be toward the distraught and “untidy” spouse, who until this moment has been in deep mourning and ought to have been in a corner of the house not noticing any of the guests or talking to any person. (Although the mourning spouse formally observes avoidance patterns at the tenth-day feast, he should have been accompaied by a matrilineal relative of the deceased until the funeral is concluded.) The grief of the spouse must be assuaged by the closest matrilineal relative of the dead, who must also release the spouse from mourning obligations toward the deceased and the kindred of the dead. To symbolize the reintegration of the mourner into society, this matrilineal relative “cleans up” the spouse by combing his hair with a new comb and by presenting him with the means to reappear among humans. Since he has symbolically been said to have rent his clothing, he is given material for a garment (enough cotton print for a dress for a woman and white shirting for a shirt for a man), a silk scarf, a handkerchief, and the comb with which he was combed. Even though the spouse need not thereafter avoid the company of humans, he must yet observe a modified type of mourning until he, in turn, has released the dead and the matrilineal family of the dead from their obligations, and until he has publicly declared that he shall “give up” the spouse (see p. 251 infra ). Occasionally, it happens that the spouse is not released at the tenth-day feast, and a variety of standard reasons may be adduced. The most common ones are that the family of the deceased cannot afford the material at that time and therefore waits until the one-year feast; that the survivor does not wish to be released from his spouse so soon, for his love and grief are too intense as yet; and that the family of the deceased harbors ill feeling and purposely neglects to release the spouse for motives of revenge, since the unreleased partner is then unable to move about freely but must continue in mourning. However, all of these situations are considered in poor taste.

The distribution of the personal effects of the deceased now follows. The speaker kneels near the pile of articles, and he begins to recapitulate chronologically the last days and death of the deceased. First he mentions each visitor who came to see the departed during the last illness and says that for this kindness the family would like him to have a final keepsake. At each of these patterned speeches the matron hands the preassigned item to the speaker, who holds it in his hand during the announcement and then returns it to the matron, who hands it to the recipient. The matron then whispers the name and deed of the next beneficiary, and the speaker may say, for example:

This evening is the tenth day. We now think the people outside should hear our voice. We are going to talk to the person... [Indian name of the individual] that gave us help when this first happened in our house. When death happens in the house, our minds are blackened. We can't think clearly. We have to look outside to the person who has a mind which is clear to help us. That is what happens when death comes. We stood outside, and our minds rested on a woman who we thought was willing to help us. So this evening we are thinking she'll hear our voice. First we plead and ask her to stop thinking of what has happened to us, and change her thoughts. We are asking her to start thinking about what our Creator has made a ruling to do. We know she is one of the people that is upholding our religion, and now she'll start carrying on and upholding our religion. And there are a lot of gatherings going on among our neighbors. Now there is nothing between us, but she may carry on her duty to help her neighbors. Now what little thing she [the deceased] had, she'll [the helper] keep to remind her, and this is our voice. It is going toward this woman that sewed clothes for the dead. So now she can take her reward.

(This is the speaker's own translation.)

Each of the helpers during all the funeral, wake, and tenth-day feast preparations is thus rewarded. For some there is a standard “fee,” such as three yards of material for the messenger, the cooks, the man who “ran” the wake, the speaker at the wake, the speaker at the funeral, and the speaker at the tenth-day feast. The gravediggers were formerly paid in material, but today they usually demand cash ($15.00). In such cases the payment is not made at the tenth-day feast, for only traditional payments of material, handkerchiefs, or scarves are ceremoniously made. Nor is the money of the deceased distributed at the feast, although the speaker may mention the principal beneficiaries. Finally, the remaining belongings are distributed to the ritual friends, friends, and relatives of the dead, in particular to the kheya[unknown] ? daweh and the agadõ[unknown] ni. All earthly things should be thus disposed of, for if an item is left undistributed, and perhaps coveted by an unauthorized heir, it may easily be the source of much later harm, particularly if it happened to be a ritual artifact. 7

When the goods of the deceased have been distributed, the family “feasts” the dead again, and the cooks and helpers pass feast foods to all the guests. In the communities down below, if a visitor has contributed a basket of food for the tenthday feast, the cooks usually fill the basket separately with a selection from the donations of food prior to the general distribution. The distribution of food at Sour Springs is to the right, but in the communities down below the food is passed to the left, “because it is a dead feast.” The distribution follows roughly the same pattern as at the festivals in the Longhouse. The cook or helper moves about the room, either handing each person in turn his share or letting him take one of the items from a basket, so that everyone is given an equal share. Each time a basket is passed around, one of the items is set aside and accumulated on behalf of the deceased, whose share is then kept overnight and disposed of in the morning. Aside from the usual feast foods (cookies, scones, corn bread, cake), the offerings may also contain oranges, chewing tobacco (which is distributed equally to all, regardless of whether one chews or not), and candies. Even though the guests take home most of the food which is passed them, they should nevertheless take at least a token bite, so that “the dead can eat off it, too.” If there are any dirty dishes, such as piepans, they should be left unremoved and unwashed until the following morning, “so that the dead may eat off them.”

The speaker ends the feast by recapitulating the purpose of the event to the dead, stating that he hopes the dead will be satisfied. The guests go home, and mourning is officially ended. The drum which was used at the wake is also “sent home” now.

The spouse and the ritual friends of the dead, however, observe a modified mourning until “giving up the dead” (or more strictly, “giving back the dead to the relatives”). During this period the mourner may go out and may associate with members of the community, but should avoid participation at the Longhouse and at pleasurable social events. A restrained, modified, semi-mournful attitude is demanded until the release at the Longhouse. “Giving up the dead” always coincides with Adõ[unknown] wa Day, which at Sour Springs is the second day of Green Corn and the sixth day of Midwinter. At Lower Cayuga, where an extra day of “pass dances” has been inserted, the Midwinter Adõdcl001;wa Day is the seventh day of the festival (see pp.169, 189 supra ). Sometimes, if a death has occurred shortly after Midwinter, the survivor may not wish to wait until Green Corn and may give up the dead at Strawberry time instead. In one instance a woman even gave up her husband at the tenth-day feast instead of waiting for the Longhouse event. She claimed that being a head deaconess, she was needed at the Longhouse and therefore could not afford to be absent until Midwinter time. However, she was criticized by the community, which felt that she merely used an excuse to avoid observing the partial mourning and staying at home. On the other hand, another head deaconess did abstain from attendance at the Longhouse until she had released her husband at Midwinter time. There are also cases where the survivor “holds on” to the deceased for two or more years, due to a reluctance to become “unmarried.” One such widow was criticized for her untoward mourning and “stinginess of her husband.”

On the occasion of “giving up the dead,” the survivor brings three yards of cloth (wrapped in paper) to the Longhouse and hands it to the proper Longhouse official (a deacon or deaconess), who in turn hands it to the speaker of the moiety of the survivor. The speaker, while holding the present, rises and pronounces the formal speech of release, at which time the survivor also rises in the Longhouse, so that all may observe and take note of the present. The speaker addresses the matrilineage of the deceased, and he explains that now the survivor “has put nice varnished boards over the grave” and that this completes his duties toward the deceased and the family of the deceased. The speaker then “sets the living out on the road” and releases all his ties to “the public.” In other words, the widow or widower is now free to remarry, and the ritual friend may marry into the family of the deceased. The length of material is then handed to the official again, who conveys it through the appropriate person to the nearest available matrilineal relative of the deceased-- e.g., a brother, sister, or mother's sister.

Even though mourning has been renounced twice, the spouse, ritual friends, and immediate family still tend to curtail their activities until the one-year feast for the dead. This feast, at which the dead is “fed” one more time, occurs on the first anniversary of the death, for it is thought that the soul of the dead, perhaps in ghost form, returns to earth again on this day. Consequently, the matrilineal family of the deceased prepares to “feed the dead” and invites the immediate family, the spouse, the family of the spouse, and friends and neighbors to share in the feast. It is again interesting to note that unless the feast is shared, it is not considered valid. Feast foods are cooked in preparation for the event, although the visitors also contribute to the feast by bringing food. The one-year feast is less formal than the tenth-day feast. Seating and moiety rules are not carefully observed, and the speaking, cooking, and passing of food may be performed by any available persons. A speaker is invited, who opens the ceremony by burning Indian tobacco in the stove in order to call the attention of the dead to the feast. The dead, who is addressed by his Indian name, is informed that he has not been forgotten, that he is being “fed,” and that it is hoped he is content. He is begged not to harm any of the mourners, since all the rituals have been carried out to the best of their ability. Then the food is distributed as is customary at death feasts, to the left at the “down-below” communities, to the right “up above.” Again an equal share is retained for the dead, which is discarded on the following morning. The dishes again are left unwashed until the morning after the feast.

If, however, at the anniversary of the death, the family feels economically unable to perform a one-year feast, the ceremony may be “promised” by burning tobacco and stating this fact. In such cases the feast may be held as soon as the family can afford it. Some families let the event slide, hoping they can avoid the feast, but it is safe to assume that before long someone will become ill, and a fortuneteller will diagnose the cause as the neglected one-year feast. It is immediately held after such a diagnosis, since worse is feared if the deceased is not propitiated. Thus, even though this feast is a very simple rite, it is backed by the strongest sanction of the culture, namely, sickness that neglect of the event may cause.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual298,Small Dead Feast,"The most common of all personal observances at Six Nations is the “small dead feast” (niwa a tihakosrah). It is observed, like all dead feasts, only when the plants are not growing, since the summoning of the dead can bring with it a killing frost. During the winter these ceremonies occur several times a week. They are popular because they fulfill a multitude of obligations, give the dead the attention they so voraciously desire, and are simple--requiring only a speaker and some tobacco in addition to the food. Usually relatives from both sides of the family are invited since all may participate in feasting an ancestor. There are other feasts for the dead, including one for dead children.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual299,Six Nations Convention,"The Six Nations Convention and Gaiwiio

After discussing the calendrical communal cycle and before discussing the shamanistic societies and practices, we must mention another main complex of the Longhouse Religion, the Good Message recitation. The Gaiwiio of Handsome Lake has been passed down to the present through several lines of speakers who memorize the Code from a predecessor. The ritualistic recitation of the Message takes place at two main types of gatherings, or conventions, the Chief's Convention and the Six Nations Convention.

Connected with the recitation of the Good Message is the practice of confession. Intense moral exhortations accompany the ceremony. It is at these meetings that the ethical-eschatological aspect of the Longhouse Religion is emphasized. Although any locally approved preacher may recite the Good Message at a Chief's Convention, only a preacher receiving validation by the elders at Tonawanda Reserve can speak at Six Nations Conventions. The recitation takes four mornings and is therefore a challenging undertaking although the prestige attached to it is great.

A Chief's Convention is held by a local Longhouse and can be called at nearly any time. There can be several reasons for calling it. First, the chiefs might decide that a moral, ritual or spiritual laxity is taking place among Longhouse members. In such a circumstance a recitation of the Good Message accompanied by moral exhortation and confessions might revive the Longhouse. Second, and most common, a chief's gathering will be held before the major ceremonials to provide a spiritual purging, so that those participating may do so more worthily and sincerely. Third, the recitation is sponsored by the chiefs in order to show respect to Handsome Lake and the Creator and by so doing give the members a chance to hear the sacred words. The latter is important and the members are grateful when such is done because they consider it a great thing to hear the message.

After lunch the members return to the Longhouse for confession and further explication of the morning's text. The Thanksgiving Address begins the meeting. The speaker explains the confession rite to the people and then two benches which will hold the penitents are placed in the center of the Longhouse. Two men who are to hear the confessions rise first and confess to the assembly aloud. The confession is usually couched in general terms. The two leaders hold the long wampum strings in their hands. Then the first group of penitents take their place on the benches, women facing men, sitting in a row.

Essential to confession is the holding of the wampum which symbolizes the holiness and seriousness of the occasion and helps to carry one's contrition to the Creator and Handsome Lake. The confessors take their place at one end of each bench and move down the bench to stand in front of each penitent, handing the latter the wampum. The penitent either in a low or high voice tells his shortcomings to the confessor. There is much emotion involved in the confessions. Weeping may accompany lengthy description and explanation of the causes of their faults. This is followed by a sincere determination to “go a straight road.” After everyone on the confession benches is finished, they are replaced by another group. 

Unlike Roman Catholic confession, there is no need to elaborate on one's sins and there is no penance. The central intent of the rite is to cleanse the person through the cathartic act of professing guilt publicly. Nineteenth century writers assumed that the Iroquois received their confession rite from the Jesuits. But the latter only had brief contacts with the Iroquois, and twentieth century ethnologists do not support this prior explanation. It is now generally agreed that Handsome Lake reaffirmed and strengthened the confessional rite, especially for witches, but that the practice itself is ancient and widespread.

Respect for Handsome Lake and the preacher is shown by participating in confession.

The act of confession, aside from offering the sinner absolution, is considered the most affirmative declaration of allegiance to the religion of the Prophet and a concrete indication of the effectiveness of the preaching. A preacher is judged by the number of people he is able to move, to cause to confess their sins, or perhaps to convert to the Longhouse. The more confessions, the more renowned is the speaker; and each confession is counted and reported to the Longhouses which sent representatives. Particularly at present, when the Longhouses are under much pressure to acculturate, the congregations like to point to the large number of confessions and affirmations of faith which occur at local conventions.

Each gathering of the three to five “days” taken to hear the recitation begins with the Thanksgiving Address and an explanation of what is to follow. The preacher is given the wampum that will be used during the convention. He is then led to a central place and faces either east or south. He is accompanied by a person from the other moiety who sees after his needs during the recitation, such as giving him Strawberry juice for his throat. No two speakers recite the same version of the Good Message, and frequently certain parts of the message will be emphasized more than others. For example, if drinking has become a problem in the community, the preachers will not only recite those sections of the Code but will interpret, elaborate, chastise, and exhort. A certain flexibility is allowed to the preacher, but if he becomes too free with the message, then people simply stay home when he is scheduled to speak. At the end of each morning's recitation the Thanksgiving Address is repeated and people dance the Feather Dance, one of the Four Sacred Rites, to show gratitude to the Creator and the preacher.

After the confessions of the day, the speaker exhorts the members to follow the Gaiwiio and those who confessed to keep their promises. A shortened version of the Thanksgiving Address marks the end of the ceremony. At the finish of the convention itself, a spokesman for the attending chiefs sends their greetings to the absent chiefs and people of the other Longhouses through their representatives. The representatives return to their respective Longhouses carrying back the wampum that their Longhouse had donated for the conference. Upon arriving they report how many confessions occurred, how many days the preaching took, and any untoward events. This encourages the home Longhouse to have its own convention. “In this way interest in the community of the Longhouses is maintained at the individual fires, and the number of confessions is taken as evidence of the vitality of the Longhouse religion. A report of a successful convention at one Longhouse inspires the desire to hold a similar convention at the home Longhouse.” 

The second ceremony held in honor of the Good Message is the Six Nations Convention. Each year near the end of September, Tonawanda sends invitations to the other Longhouses to attend the initial Six Nations meeting. Although all members of the invited Longhouses are welcome, the custom is now to send just a representative to Tonawanda. A week after the Six Nations meeting at Tonawanda, a circuit of selected Longhouses is made to recite the Code. The Longhouses are scheduled so that each sponsors a Six Nations every other year. There is at present a movement to change it to once every four years, due to the expense entailed and the burden placed on smaller Longhouses.

The Six Nations Convention usually starts on a Sunday at Tonawanda and ends on a Thursday. All of its Longhouse members attend and sit on the south side, while the representatives of other Longhouses sit on the north. The invitation wampums are ceremonially returned by the representatives. They also make a monetary contribution to the convention and answer whether their Longhouse will accept being a part of the circuit for that year. Details as to coordination of dates are informally worked out during the convention.

Following an introduction and thanks for attendance, the Thanks-giving address is made. The firekeepers circle the house counter-clockwise (the traditional custom of all Longhouse movements except the Dead Feast) shaking hands and greeting the visitors. The firekeepers then announce that they have a few things to say. A formal address is given, recalling the life and teachings of the Prophet and how the Longhouse Religion came into being. Since the beginning of the Religion, the central fire of the Longhouses of the Six Nations has been burning at Tonawanda. As Shimony notes, “Every year, when ready, one pokes it and renews it, and every year the teachings of Handsome Lake are preached. All the Longhouses around must come and renew what they know of Handsome Lake's teaching. This way Handsome Lake's teachings will never go down as long as people still believe in his teachings.” Following the introductory speech, the members get down to the business of choosing a Gaiwiio preacher for the convention and fixing the number of days for the convention. They finish the meeting with a Thanksgiving Address.

The remaining days are taken up with the recitation of the Code, confessions, business meetings and in the evenings, social dances. The different representatives give reports on how many attend the major ceremonies and what activities were held over the past year. Thanks is given by the fire-keeper that the Longhouse Religion is strong and that the people still think of the Great Creator. The convention ends with the Thanksgiving Address.

Attendance at the convention by local people and the representatives is also stimulated by the desire to see the wampum that contains the mnemonics concerning the teachings of Handsome Lake: the hierarchy of chiefs, faith-keepers and people; the events occurring after the death of Handsome Lake; the correct behavior of the people, and predictions of the future. Part of the predictions includes the warning that a sign of the end times will be the waning of Longhouse devotion. Hence, the message is clear: if the end of the world is not to be hastened, then the Longhouse must be strong. The wampum is not read fully today since some of the messages would be too difficult for the peace chiefs to live up to.",0,1,0,0,1,1
Ritual300,Funeral,"Funerary Customs and Religious Symbolism Among the Kogi

Near the Caribbean seaboard in the northern lowlands of Colombia rises an isolated mountain massif, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. At the time of the Spanish Conquest, in the early sixteenth century, the foothills and lower valleys of these mountains were occupied by the Tairona Indians, a native tribe which had reached a level of cultural complexity equal, if not superior, to the Muisca culture of the Andean highlands of the interior. At the present time there still remain several thousand Indians who are descendants of the Tairona and who continue to live in relative isolation in the cool uplands of the Sierra Nevada. There are three tribes, all of them speaking dialects of the ancient Chibcha language: the Kogi, the Ika, and the Sanhá, numbering about 6,000 individuals in all. The Kogi are still very little acculturated and occupy mainly the northern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, but some groups live on the western and eastern slopes, in close vicinity to the Ika and the Sanhá whose tribal territories cover rather the southern and southeastern slopes.  

Although these three tribes present marked physical and linguistic differences, they all share many cultural traits which form part of a common tradition, and the Sierra Nevada thus represents a single cultural area. The Ika and Sanhá are considerably more acculturated than the Kogi, especially in their economic activities, and they look with contempt upon the Kogi whose fields, houses, and general subsistence level they consider to be very deficient. However, in everything concerning the religious sphere, the Ika and Sanhá recognize quite openly the superiority of the Kogi. As a matter of fact, the religious system of the Ika and Sanhá is, in essence, a less elaborate variant of Kogi religion and to the former the Kogi are, and always have been, the possessors of a body of esoteric knowledge which is extremely important to all tribes of the Sierra Nevada. This dependence manifests itself in the fact that the other two tribes will approach the Kogi to consult them on religious matters or to ask them to officiate on a variety of ceremonial occasions.

The Kogi, on the other hand, certain of possessing the secrets of the “true” religion, assume in front of their neighbors the attitude of benevolent “elder brothers” of mankind and are, therefore, obligated to propagate the true faith and to teach their “younger brothers,” the Ika and Sanhá. It therefore quite frequently happens that the Kogi visit the villages of the neighboring tribes in order to take a leading part in their religious activities.

In all three tribes the men who are specialists in the interpretation, transmission, and execution of religious principles, are designated by the term máma and generally they are old men who have spent many years of apprenticeship at the side of a specialist of high reputation. These men are not shamans or curers, but constitute a class of tribal priests who are highly respected. The mámas of the Kogi enjoy very high prestige all over the Sierra Nevada because they are said to have a very profound knowledge of the tribal traditions and, in particular, of the rituals which are necessary to guarantee the order of the universe. Thanks to the mámas of the Kogi the sun follows his daily round; the seasons change in an orderly fashion, and the great principle of fertility, central to all religious thought, continues to manifest itself in nature as well as in all living creatures. The mámas celebrate the various rituals of the individual’s life cycle, and also officiate at the collective ceremonials, the dances, offerings, and other occasions.

In the present paper I shall refer to one of these ritual occasions, specifically to a burial rite, which I was able to attend during recent fieldwork in the Sierra Nevada. The ritual took place in the village of Seráncua, a small Ika settlement on the headwaters of the Cataca River. Seráncua is only a few hours from Mamaróngo, a major ceremonial center of the Kogi, and the Ika living in the surroundings are therefore strongly influenced by their neighbors.

The Ika of Seráncua had invited a Kogi priest from Mamaróngo to officiate in some minor rituals such as the purification of several houses and the preparation of collective offerings. On the first day of the priest’s arrival there occurred an incident which was very characteristic of Ika-Kogi relationships. As soon as the máma arrived the Ika hurriedly took several sick people to the house where he was staying and asked him to cure them. There was a man who had a spell of fever, a woman who suffered from hemorrhages, and another man who had broken an arm. The máma looked stoically at the sick. After a while he said slowly: “I do not know how to cure the fever; I do not know how to stop bleeding. Neither do I know how to set broken bones. All I know is to talk to god.” He said these words in a quite superior and ironic manner as, obviously, he felt somewhat offended by the fact that the Ika were taking him for a simple curer, he being a high-ranking priest. Having thus made clear his status, he was treated from then on with great respect. At nightfall he joined the men who had gathered in the ceremonial house, where he spoke to them in a low voice, advising them on how to prepare their offerings and inquiring discreetly into village affairs, always with great patience and with a faint smile of tolerant ennui.

During these days a young unmarried Ika woman had died. When news of her death became known in the village, the máma gave orders to prepare more offerings and gave notice to the family of the dead girl that, in the afternoon, he would officiate at the burial.

The cemetery was located on a hill slope, about 200 meters to the south of the village. The ground was covered with high grass and there were several irregular stones, half buried in the soil, marking the individual graves. At a short distance there was underbrush and then the forest began, but on the burial ground itself no trees were growing. On the day of the burial the following people gathered at the cemetery: the Kogi priest, the local Ika priest, the parents and the maternal grandmother of the dead woman and theree maternal cousins of the woman’s father. After discussing for a while in low voices the best location for the burial pit, the Ika priest walked away from the group toward the east and then sat facing toward the west. He now concentrated in order to divine the precise spot for the burial. Chewing coca leaves and watching the clouds on the western horizon he sat in silence for about half an hour. Meanwhile the Kogi priest sat down next to me and said: “The Ika are our younger brothers. They don’t quite know yet how to bury their dead,” and then, looking around at the others, he added: “I have to teach our younger brothers; such is the law.”

Now the ritual was beginning. The Kogi priest stood facing toward the east and, with a mute gesture, delimited before him a small stretch of ground, perhaps one meter square; he ordered the men to clear the ground and, with their bush-knives, they now cut the grass and scraped the soil, cleaning it of roots and pebbles. Then the men stepped back and the priest took several dry coca leaves from his bag and, holding some leaves in each hand close to his chest, stepped into the middle of the space which had been cleared. He then turned toward the south and slowly moved his hands, always close to the chest, as if weighing the leaves, sometimes lifting the right hand, sometimes the left. After a minute or so he turned to face the north and repeated the movements of the hands, again starting with the left hand in a slightly lower position, lifting it up higher until the right hand was lower. Then he turned toward the east and, standing at the western edge of the space, pulverized the dry leaves between his fingers and let the dust fall to the ground, first from the left hand and then from the right. While doing this he said: “This is the village of Death; this is the ceremonial house of Death; this is the house of Death; this is the uterus. I am going to open the house. The house is closed and I shall open it.” He now took from his bag a small wooden spade and with it picked up some earth from the eastern side; turning to the left he deposited the soil on the western side. There he picked up soil and, turning again, put it on the eastern side. Then he picked up soil from the south and placed it on the north where, again, he picked up soil and deposited it in the south. He now said: “The house is open,” and ordered the men to start digging. At this moment the Ika priest changed his position; walking toward the west he passed by the group of people and sat down again, this time turning his back to us. The men worked in silence, digging a round hole. When they had reached a depth of about 50 cm. the priest ordered the dead woman’s father and another man to bring the corpse which was lying in front of the ceremonial house in the village. While the other men continued to dig, the two descended to the village and soon returned with the corpse which was wrapped in a large carrying net. They deposited their burden at the southern edge of the pit and now the dead woman’s parents began to prepare the body under the supervision of the priest. The deceased had been dressed in a white cotton garment of the kind unmarried girls wear and had been tied with ropes into a flexed position, with the knees drawn up to the chest and the hands touching the chin. After having taken the corpse out of the carrying net, the father pressed down the eyelids of the dead girl, to make sure they were closed. He then placed the body on a large piece of white cotton cloth and began to wrap it beginning at the feet. The girl’s mother had brought with her two skeins of whitish sisal fibers and the father took one of them and twisted a long string. With a bone needle the mother had brought, he now sewed up the corpse, beginning at the feet and forming, eventually, a compact bundle. When he came to the head he took the remaining skein of fibers and twisted from them a stout rope of more than one meter length, one end of which he tied firmly to the hair on top of the head of the corpse. He then continued to sew the cloth until he covered the head also. Then, with the help of the other men, the father placed the body into the carrying net again, tying it firmly into a bundle and fixing to it a loop of rope to serve as a handle.

While the men were thus busy with the corpse, the mother and the grandmother who were sitting nearby began to intone a slow dirge, a long-drawn wailing song without words. From their carrying bags they took some small bundles of dry maize leaves which they opened and from which they extracted a few small marine shells, some of them of conical gastropods. Holding the shells in their hands they addressed them in low voices saying that they were “food for the dead.” They then gave the shells to the men who placed them into the folds of the carrying net which held the corpse.

The máma stood now at the northern edge of the burial pit and, with deliberately slow movements, took off his cap, then his two carrying bags, and lastly the small bag of coca leaves he had been wearing. Taking once more some dry leaves in both hands he repeated the gestures of “weighing” the content of each hand, lifting or lowering one hand or the other. He then scattered the dry leaves over the bottom of the pit which, by now, was about one meter deep. Taking from one of the bags several small bundles of leaves, he stepped into the pit and slowly untied the little packages of dry maize leaves. Extracting from them some pulverized stones, seeds, and cotton fibers he deposited these in the center of the bottom. Stepping out of the pit again the máma now approached the corpse. There was a moment of great tension; everybody looked at him watching anxiously every gesture, every expression on his face. Standing with his feet well apart, planted firmly on the ground, as if preparing himself to lift up a heavy weight the máma bent over and grasped the rope handle with both hands, trying to lift the corpse. By his bodily position as well as by his facial expression he made it understood that he was making a great effort and that the corpse was very heavy. As a matter of fact, it seemed that he could hardly lift it from the ground; he lowered the corpse again and looked around at the others with a gesture of impotence, of doubt. After a short while he stooped again and tried to lift the carrying net but soon he straightened again, giving the impression that his strength had failed him. There followed long minutes of anxious silence. At the third attempt the máma pretended that the corpse was somewhat less heavy then before. He smiled and, looking at the others as if to encourage them, he bent down again to lift the corpse. Nine times this act was repeated and each time the máma made it understood that the corpse was becoming lighter and lighter. At the ninth time, smiling, he picked up the corpse as if it was almost weightless, as if it were something small and light. People looked at each other with relief. The máma placed the corpse carefully on the ground and walked to the other side of the pit. After throwing a few coca leaves into it he directed the father to place the corpse in the pit, lying on its left side and with the head toward the east. The father now went to the underbrush and soon returned with an armload of green fern leaves which he spread carefully over the corpse. The máma now ordered the men to fill the pit with earth, but when it was half full he interrupted them in their work and took from his bag five small bundles the contents of which he placed in the pit at the four cardinal points. There were some very small stones, some seeds, and some white cotton. The contents of the fifth bundle he placed in the middle of the pit, directly on top of the corpse.

During the entire process of filling in the grave care had been taken not to bury the rope which was tied to the dead woman’s hair, and the máma often reminded the men not to lose sight of it and to keep it taut. When finally the pit was completely filled in the máma asked one of the men to bring a thin rod, about 80 cm. long. The father now tied the free end of the rope to this stick which he pushed vertically into the soft soil while twisting the remaining rope loosely around it. In the meantime the other men had brought a heavy stone which they placed over the pit, next to the rod. Then the men stepped back while the máma placed the contents of another leaf bundle at the foot of the rod. He then again took his little spade and now “closed” the grave, this time in the inverse order, by carrying earth from south to north, north to south, west to east and east to west.

The máma now called the parents of the dead woman and asked them to stand in front of him, at the western side of the grave. He said to them: “Turn around completely to the left.” The two did as told. “Now turn around completely to the right,” he continued. The two turned rapidly and the máma said: “Now go away while turning left.” The couple began to descend the slope, turning and turning until, after a while, they continued to walk toward the village. Then the others passed before the máma, turning first to the left, then to the right. “Get going, get going!” the máma said. When all had left he walked back to the grave and stood facing toward the east. Very slowly he turned to the right and then, three times, to the left. With the last turn he started to walk downhill, always turning, until the burial ground was far behind. While all those who had touched the corpse now went to a nearby creek to wash their hands and arms and to clean their bush-knives, the máma went directly to his house.

Nine days later, the máma, followed by the dead woman’s parents, returned to the burial ground. The máma grasped the end of the rope which was tied to the rod and pulled at it, lightly first, then more strongly. The fibers were already rotten and when suddenly the rope broke, they all smiled and nodded and returned to the village.

The burial rite I have described so far lasted approximately two hours and was carried out in almost complete silence. Except for the women’s dirge only the máma had spoken a few times, but there had been no prayers, nor chants; only a few short indications given to the men who were digging the grave, and to the parents as they prepared the corpse. However, it was a ritual in which every phase, every step, had been carried out with great precision.

A casual observer could easily think that this was a very simple rite and he might deduce, from what he had seen, that the burial rites of these Indians were limited to a few quite elementary practices. Worse still would be the conclusions of an archaeologist who, at some future time, in digging up this grave would find nothing more than a simple pit, with a flexed skeleton facing east. But perhaps both—our casual observer and the imaginary archaeologist of the future—would be very much mistaken. As a matter of fact, behind this apparently very simple ritual I have described there exist complex ideas and there lie religious and philosophic concepts of unusual interest.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Ritual301,"The Gaulí Ceremony, Baptism","Baptism

It is necessary to “baptize” everything which is born and grows, but only in the case of a newborn baby is the word gaulí, “baptism,” employed. This word is derived from gau -- to make, and it was invariably translated with “hechura,” /making, creation/. During the gaulí ceremony “the Máma makes the child” in the sense that he brings it into the cycle of life and death, as a link in the chain of its ancestors. If the gaulí were not celebrated, the child’s mother would not be able to work in the fields or feed the child or prepare food for anyone, not even for animals. Both she and the baby would become sick and eventually die. Thus the ceremony of the “baptism” of the newborn child should be performed as early as possible. Nonetheless a term of several weeks is expected, and, in fact, although the Kogi do not want to admit it, the gaulí is sometimes celebrated months after the birth. Since the ceremony means certain economic expenses for the family, its date is sometimes postponed for that reason, although it would never seriously affect the family economy.

Those who attend the “baptism,” in addition to the parents of the child, are the grandparents, the brothers and sisters of the parents, their children, and, in general terms, any individual who belongs to the extended family. The ceremony takes place in the house of the Máma and should last for nine days and nights (in fact it lasts for four or five days), during which the Máma plays the principal role. The child’s father is required to bring sufficient food for the Máma and all of those present, as well as to bring offerings for the Universal Mother, Death, and different Fathers and Mothers. This food consists of dried platanos, frijoles, and “meat from the woods,” that is to say, game from hunting, such as birds, mice, or some larger rodent. First the Máma practices the divination called alúna sewá (“security of the alúna ”) and divines the name of an ancestor of the baby. The men always receive names which end in makú -- chief, “cacique” /see the glossary, p.320 / ( limakú xalmakú maravimakú, malyinmakú ); women receive names which end in -ang, -yang (máluman, koáldekang) . The Máma then intones a long incantation to the ancestors and at the end hands over to the child’s father a small stone (sén-kalda) . This small stone has an irregular, somewhat elliptical shape and is pierced if it is a matter of a girl, but is unpierced if it is a boy. This stone represents the child itself and is identified directly with it and its name. It is “its place in the world”; it is a permanent, invariable, and untransferable protection for the individual, which is inseparable from him until death and which accompanies him even beyond, to the Country of the Dead. The father keeps this little stone in his bag and hands it over to the child after his initiation, or, when it is a girl, after the ceremony of the first menstruation. The father in turn hands over to the Máma the little bag which contains the umbilical cord and the first excrements of the baby, and he buries it, in the presence of the child and the parents, under a small pile of stones on the banks of the nearby stream. From them on this place is linked with the child throughout his life, and he will occasionally deposit offerings there, especially in case of illness.

The father and mother then communicate to the Máma their desires for the future of the child and ask him to “put himself in accord” with the ancestors of both families in order to secure their benevolence for him. Since in all families it is presumed that there is some “bad” ancestor, the Máma takes charge of pacifying these so that they will not exercise their infamous influences upon the child. The gaulí ceremony consists principally of songs by the Máma referring to the genealogy of the child and to his future, well-being. This “well-being” is understood in terms of food and fertility, and the Máma asks the Universal Mother to provide the baby always with food and sexual energy. The emphasis in the ceremony is upon the concern with seeing to it that the child be “fertile,” that he be a procreator of future generations.

Following this, the Máma intones a song in which he addresses himself to the Universal Mother and communicates to her that the child has been “baptized,” saying the name of the baby repeatedly. Without this song the child, in case of his dying, would not be able to leave this life easily, but would remain for a long time in a comatose state. Then the Máma addresses another song to Gaulkuché, the Master of the Dead, to whom he also communicates the name of the child. This song prevents Gaul-kuché from saying, upon the death of the child: “I do not know you! Go away from here!” The child would then wander about lost on the Road of the Dead, asking other dead persons to take him with them and thus presenting an obstacle and an unfortunate delay for others who are traveling the long and dangerous journey between the two worlds. But once the name has been communicated to the Master of the Dead, the child “may now die,” because now he is known in the Beyond.

Now the Máma brings a bag woven by his wife and called bag of the bat” (nyúiji-gamá), since it is said that “the bat made the child out of blood” ( 3 ). The baby is placed, seated, on its mother’s knees, and the Máma now takes out of the aforementioned bag a variety of cooked foods which were prepared by his wife in a special pot and with appropriate incantations. The food consists of small pieces of yuca, potato, frijol, fish, and a small wild fruit similar to a small onion ( 4 ). The Máma takes piece after piece between his fingers and with the food touches the baby’s forehead, chest, fingers, knees, and feet. At the same time he intones a song addressed to the noksása bird, a species of blackbird, of which it is said that it is characterized by the great amount of food which it eats and the rapidity with which it digests it. “It eats and defecates, eats and defecates,” say the Kogi. After having touched the baby with the foods, the Máma puts them back in the bag, which he keeps in order to use its contents after the ceremony as an offering to the Universal Mother, burying it near his ceremonial chair.

During the entire gaulí ceremony, the Máma “works,” of course, in every phase, first with his left hand and to the “left side,” and then with his right hand and to the “right side.” It is said that during the first two days the ceremonial is performed only “to take out the bad,” and then for two days “to bring the good.” On the last day the Máma places bindings of cotton thread on the baby’s wrists by means of which he transmits “strength” ( káma ) to him and protects him against illness. At times these bindings contain little black beads, and the Máma also gives the father some little dry seeds which are pierced so that they may later be put around the baby’s neck in the form of a small necklace. The baby is given a small totuma /vessel made out of the fruit of Crescentia cujete / containing sugar-cane water to drink, and with this act the “baptism” is considered ended. From now on the baby is included in the life on this earth and in that of the universe. He has been made a link in the long chain of his ancestors.

The name of a child, which is that of an ancestor of his father or, in the case of a girl, of one of her mother, is used only in ceremonies and is still considered essentially secret. This name is not used in the family circle, but rather the little ones are called: my son, sonny, child, etc. (saumá, nasukuá) . Illegitimate children receive names of a paternal ancestor and later no distinction is made between them and the others. The children of a Máma should be “baptized” by another Máma . At least that is the culturally sanctioned attitude, but in reality this rule is not always observed. One Kogi said: “A doctor cannot cure himself because he can never look at himself from all sides. Thus is it with baptism.”

It is common among the Kogi to have their children baptized in the nearest Colombian town by a Catholic priest. In their concept, a name is a protection and a Christian name serves as protection and identification before the national government and before the Colombians in general. The idea of being able to identify oneself, of having some written certificate which certifies something about the person of its bearer, is very important for the Kogi, and a Catholic baptism is an occasion for making oneself even more secure. It is another “security.” At times those who have been baptized forget their Christian names or change them in such a way that they can scarcely be recognized. These names naturally are not inherited, but they are generally adopted from a neighboring colonist / colono; see the glossary, p. 320 / who has been named “compadre” according to the Creole / criolla; see the glossary, p. 320/ custom and with which is pursued the practical aim of obtaining a substantial present and getting oneself in a chain of mutual obligations with a person of influence.

During the period between the birth and the “baptism,” the strict sexual taboo between the parents of the baby continues. The latter receives as nourishment only his mother’s breast and he may eat other forms of food only after the ceremony described. Both reasons naturally contribute to making the term in which the “baptism” is celebrated not overly long. When the baby is illegitimate, the man invites the biological father to the ceremony, but he asks him to cut firewood and to bring food, thus showing his obligation to provide for the infant; this is a duty which, as we shall see, is only expressed at this moment, symbolically, and which is never touched on again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual302,Initiation,"Puberty — Initiation — Adolescence

In approaching the eleventh or twelfth year, the difficult period of puberty begins for the Kogi child. For both sexes this means essentially the same phenomenon, but their surroundings and their individual preparation cause a very different emotional shock, depending on the sex.

The male child has lived in isolation in the last years, imitating his father in his apparent independence and finding a certain satisfaction in the fact of being isolated from the world of women. He has now become an almost permanent guest in the ceremonial house; he has seen many dances, heard many songs, and has been present at “advice” and punishments among the adults. From time to time he has been brought before the Máma who has “advised” him and who has deposited some offerings in a sacred place in his name. He is now almost a man. He knows how to catch the ox, how to lift stones in order to put the road in order, how to operate the loom. He has walked alone for hours along the silent roads of the woods or of the paramo, fulfilling some order which his father or the Máma entrusted to him. He looks upon women with a certain scorn. What do they know of what he knows how to do?

His mother is no longer the same as before. She has other small children to attend to, she has no time for him now, pays no attention to him. He finds no refuge in his father. Any 212 question addressed to him remains unanswered and instead results in an abrupt and poorly dissembled order. “Bring the ox, clean the yard, find my knife!” But the father observes. With deep concern he observes his son, and he often talks with the Máma about him and tells him that he now knows how to load the ox, he now knows how to repair the road, that he knows how to make halters, he knows how to weave, “he understands advice.” But he hastens to add that his son knows nothing about women. The Máma asks questions and thinks about the answers, and finally he asks the father to bring him some offering in order that everything be “in accord.” The Máma “divines” and he knows: the boy will be a man. Soon he will be a man, soon he will have a woman. Soon he will dance in the ceremonial house; together with the other men he will eat coca, will hear “advice,” and will have “security.” But all must be “in accord” that it may be thus. Everything, no detail must be lacking.

In the meantime the boy knows that something is being prepared for him, some alternative, some decision. And, as he has learned to do since he was little, he wants to run away from this problem. Suddenly he no longer wants to be a man. He wants to continue to be a child, without responsibility, without anything; he only wants to be near his mother. But nobody now considers him a child. Nor as an adult. He is a boy, a proverbial “boy who does not know,” scorned by all, object of everybody’s suspicions, victim of everybody’s blows. “You look like a boy” is the gravest insult which can be said to a Kogi. It is an insult which produces deep emotion. “I am not a boy; I am a man!” the offended one shouts. This “boy” is the child at the age of puberty, the child who “does not know,” who is now a potential rival in the dietary field and who is beginning to be a rival in the sexual field. He is not looked upon as merely ignorant, but as malicious. The accusation that he “does not know” does not now refer to abstract knowledge, but to the observation of the rules of conduct of the men, which the “boy” still does not observe. The “boy” is thus an asocial element, dangerous for the family, for the society, for the course of the universe. It is necessary to put him under observation, and all the men watch him from a distance. Could he now be thinking about a woman? Which one? Why is it that he is so fat? He must certainly be stealing food!

There is never lacking in the ceremonial house some old man who from time to time preaches bitterly against the “boys.” It seems that the world is full of “boys.” And that is why things are going so badly. It is all the fault of the “boys.”

Thus months and months, sometimes whole years, pass. The “boys” become the center of tension in the family and the whole town, but nevertheless nobody is eager to eliminate this tension, to end this situation. On the contrary, there seems to be a purpose in this long wait to which the society exposes the young man in order to pass from one stage of life to another. It is a tension which is fomented, which is discussed almost with fondness. Meanwhile, the Máma “divines” and thinks about the matter. He forgets about it for months and then suddenly concerns himself about it with great zeal, divining once more, thinking, divining. The Máma knows who the boy’s grandparents and great-grandparents were, he knows what “securities” are appropriate for him, he knows where his Túxe originated. It is complicated “to put everything in accord.” Finally the Máma makes up his mind to initiate the boy. He notifies the father, and the latter, accompanied by the boy, now goes to the house of the Máma, loaded with offerings of food. A long ceremonial conversation takes place between the Máma and the youth. The latter, already instructed beforehand by his father, answers him in a low voice and without looking at anyone. Yes, he wants to be initiated, he wants to be a man, he wants to have a poporo, he wants to learn the “law of the ancients,” he wants to help to sustain the world. The Máma withdraws and divines anew, this time to find out in what particular place the ceremony should take place. Generally it is near the house of the Máma or near the ceremonial center or near a large rock or near a river. The Máma, followed only by the boy, now goes to the place indicated. When he arrives there, he intones a song to the Mother and then puts into the mouth of the youth four coca leaves which he takes out of his bag. When the boy has chewed these leaves, the Máma takes them out of his mouth again and gives him four others, and thus four times. Then the Máma takes out of his bag a little gourd of lime and a little stick of wood, both manufactured by the boy and handed over to the Máma the day before. The little gourd does not yet have an opening, and the Máma hands him the two objects and says: “Now I give you the little gourd! Now I give you woman! Since you are now a man, I now give you a woman!” Then the Máma explains to the boy the symbolism of the little gourd. It represents a woman, or more properly the female sexual organ. The little stick of wood is the penis. To introduce the stick into the gourd represents coitus: Then the Máma orders the youth to pierce the gourd with the stick and indicates to him that this act represents defloration. The boy pushes the stick against one end of the vessel and thus produces a round opening. Then he passes the stick four times around the opening; then the gourd is his.

Should the youth die now, he would then find a woman in the Beyond, the “little-gourd woman.” She would have his food ready for him, his house clean, the fire lighted. The woman who exists from this moment on in the other world would protect the youth as her husband and would help him on the Road of the Dead, in the nine pueblos, to pay the fines and to defend himself against the Mámas who would accuse the dead man of the evils which he might have committed on this earth.

Then the Máma hands over to the youth a little gourd with tobacco juice and shows him the place nearby where he should make the “house of the little gourd” (hú-tsukve, súgi-hubé) . This is a small house, the exact replica of a ceremonial house, but scarcely a meter and a half high and the same in diameter. While the Máma is showing him the place and explaining its construction to him, he talks to him about the future sexual relations between man and woman. Then he gives him “advice”: “You must not mistreat the woman! You must not have bad principles. You must not speak with four tongues!” Finally he tells him the “Advice of the Snake.” “The Universal Mother one day gave advice to the Snake, but the latter refused to listen. Then the Mother ordered that he stay forever in the woods and kill people. Then the Mother called another Snake and gave him ‘advice.’ This snake did listen to the ‘advice’ and he does not kill people.” At the end the Máma orders the youth to begin the construction of the little house on the following day, and, in fact, he finishes this job after several hours. Now the Máma asks the boy for the little gourd and he places it inside the building. There it is “pledged.” The Máma then calls an old woman, generally a widow 50 to 60 years old. The youth must cohabit with her inside the little house in order to “pay” for the little gourd and get it back. Men remember this experience with horror. Various informants expressed themselves as follows: “One does not know what to do and one is frightened. Thus the woman teaches one, little by little. Others are afraid and they cannot. If one cannot the first time, then the Máma says that he must do it the next day, until he gets results.”

After the ceremonial coitus with the old woman (hibagayáma, hibaxsukéchi, mámaskéchi), the youth takes his little gourd and keeps it. This object is not used, but rather is preserved as something sacred, and to replace it the youth can now obtain another one for his daily use. The secretions from the sexual organs should be gathered up in a piece of cotton to be handed over to the Máma, who then offers them as “food” to Heiséi . With this act the boy is regarded as definitively accepted in the circles of the men, is counted as an adult, and possesses, in the form of the little gourd, a sewá of extraordinary value inasmuch as it assures him of a woman in the Beyond. Despite the fact that the initiation has now taken place, the initiate must now fulfill various requirements implied by his new status. The youth possesses in the little gourd the sewá for seeking a girl for himself. Since marriage is always preceded by a longer or shorter “engagement” period, during which the two live in the house of the father of the “fiancée” (gaya), the youth must then obtain the sewá for beginning sexual relations with her. This sewá consists of a small round, flat stone about two centimeters in diameter (akutú) ( 11 ), called: “the place, the bench.” The Máma asks the youth for an offering of “food” for the Master of Sexuality, and the initiate hands over this offering in the form of some necklace beads, in exchange for which he receives the sewá whose use the Máma then explains to him. When the sexual act is performed, the small stone is placed on the ground under the woman’s sexual organs. The man must now be careful not to let a drop of sperm fall on the ground. To perform coitus without this stone would be a very great offense and would lead to the “End of the World.” Nonetheless, if the semen should fall on the ground, the mere presence of the stone is sufficient so that this would not have fatal consequences. The importance of the stone is its presence.

The rite of initiation represents essentially the introduction of the individual to sexual life. It is natural that the symbolism of the ceremony, the beginning of the slow intoxication of cocaine ( 12 ), and, above all, the tremendous experience of the first coitus cause a profound impression at this age.

But what now changes the entire life of the youth is not, at bottom, the instructions of the Máma, but rather the fact that suddenly, literally overnight, society expects from him conduct very different from that customary previously and that this conduct is contradictory to the personality of the individual who, during these years, is just beginning to discover the possibilities and potentialities of it.

In the first place, after the initiation the whole emotional tie between mother and son is presumed to have been broken. She is now considered a danger to her son, since the society assumes that she might be a potential seductress. It is similarly felt that the youth represents a danger for his mother, as a possible sexual aggressor. The society constantly dwells upon the latent danger of incest and demands that the youth avoid his mother. The form of this prohibition is ill-defined, but it achieves its purpose. It is simply expected that the youth, after his initiation, will not sleep in the same house with his mother, not sit near her, not eat near her, not discuss personal problems with her, and, in general, avoid all physical and social contact with her. On the other hand, the society expects that the youth will take advantage of his new status, that he will marry, make his own home, and thus contribute to a new cycle of economic collaboration, following the example of his father. But here the society almost demands the impossible. There are several factors which make these years a period of tension, of humiliation, of difficulties in every way.

During childhood the individual has experienced a protected existence conditioned by his mother. No other person had intervened in this intimate union between mother and son during the first two years. Although the formation of a sense of security suffered certain shocks, the mother was ultimately always a refuge and a source of gratifications. As a somewhat older child, he had worked with his mother for several years in the tight circle of the family economy, learning from her in particular what food is. It was she who taught him to move, to talk, to eat, who inculcated upon him everything concerning his body, his secretions, his gratifications. Warmth, food, defecation, infantile sexuality, with regard to all of this it was his mother who awakened, taught, and gratified him. When at five or six years old he began to work with his father, no emotional tie united the child with him. From his father he learned the technical domain of things, the domain of the external world. From him he learned to cut firewood, to sharpen the machete, to saddle the ox, to put the road in order. From him he learned fragments of genealogy, songs, and myths. But the warmth of the fire, the taste of the totuma full of soup, the mended garment, that was the unforgettable world of the mother and a world much more real, more immediate, and more gratifying than this lugubrious environment of the men, in which everything is demanded and nothing given. But the world of the mother was now prohibited. In its place came another world, the world of marriage and of religion, synonyms for the lost mother, but rarely satisfactory substitutes.

These years of adolescence are a period of poor diet. Separated from the mother, but dependent upon her for daily food, the youths eat less and less, and the effect of the coca makes them lose their appetite. It is also a period of wandering journeys, first separations from the family. These journeys are not institutionalized and the society does not approve of them, but they are frequent, either to visit other towns with the hope of finding a wife there, or simply to travel and get away from everything. During these travels, or near the paternal home, the youth now has secret sexual experiences, sometimes with married women, sometimes with individuals of his own sex. But they are secret relations, prohibited and short in duration, which are not satisfactory and only increase his anxiety. Sometimes the youth’s imagination now turns and concentrates on a certain woman, abhorred, but strangely united with him forever: the old widow of the “house of the poporo.” She is an old woman who knows, who has lived, who understands men, and the youth is not ignorant of the fact that she would readily receive him.

The youth does not yet feel wholly accepted in the circle of the men. “He still does not know”; he is a youth who has barely left off being a “boy,” but he is still more “boy” than man. “He still lacks much” of what is to be learned, and thus, when the others gather in the ceremonial house, he remains alone, isolated, watching. He has no friends, because friendship does not exist among the Kogi. There are men of his family and men of other families; there are people of the same Túxe and there are people of other Túxe, but friends do not exist. The Máma himself asks that the men not be friends with one another since this would lead to adultery. If two men are together frequently, they will become enamored of each other’s wives and all would end in a fight. “There is no reason to call a man a friend if perhaps tomorrow you would have to call him enemy!” Food, woman, one’s own house, this is what he should seek, and every day the urgency is more pressing. Above all to get a woman, because she means food and security.

The situation of the girls at this age is quite different, although their initiation is similar to that of the males. As soon as a girl has her first menstruation, the Máma is notified, and he prepares the ceremony “to put the woman in order” / “componer la mujer” /. It is the duty of the mothers to teach their daughters what behavior is to be observed when the first menstruation appears, and they are responsible if this behavior is not observed. The first drops of blood must be collected in cotton at once and must not “be lost” for any reason. If a girl were careless in this regard, all of her children would die or she would have only abortions. These drops of blood are “food” for Heiséi, and they are delivered to the Máma, who offers them up to Death in a sacred place. The rest of the blood should be collected carefully with frailejon leaves, which are later burned outside the house and should not be seen. Then the Máma divines who should deflower the girl. Generally this is an “Elder,” a man who is not related to her, but many times the Máma himself performs this act. The man, or the Máma, then builds a small house (nyuíji hubé -- the house of the bat), where the first coitus is to take place. On the previous day the Máma gives the girl a spindle wheel and a needle of deer bone (sometimes made out of its antlers) and explains to the girl that these two implements represent male and female sexual organs. Both objects are placed in the little house, and after the coitus the girl gathers them up and keeps them carefully since they are the sewá which now allow her to marry. Coitus must be repeated for four days, and it is said that the hymen should be broken gradually and not in the first act, since otherwise the girl would be sterile in her marriage. Upon leaving the little house, the man touches the girl’s navel with the point of the little lime stick, an act with which the initiation is considered ended. The man who performed the defloration, and who is regarded as “hired” by the girl’s family, now receives from her parents some gifts of food, such as yuca, platanos, or potatoes. The Máma fumigates the woman’s house for several days, burning frailejon leaves.

The life of the girl does not change in the slightest. She had always been remote from her father and from all the men, working only with her mother and with other women. It is not asked of her that she change her life or that she learn anything new or that she take part in any activities unknown until this moment. She is simply now eligible as a wife, and this, speaking of the Kogi, is at this age more equivalent to the concept of “cook.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual303,Annual Ceremonies of the Dances of the Masks,"We shall now see how these annual ceremonies of the dances of the masks are performed. Once the day for the beginning of the ceremony has been determined by divination, the whole town is cleaned, and the road which leads from it to the nearby stream or river, where those attending will take their ritual baths, is repaired. Then the Máma lights a fire in the ceremonial house by means of a drill, afterwards feeding the flames with certain woods which have been brought exclusively for this purpose. In the meantime the fire is extinguished in all of the houses and is then lighted again with embers which each man brings from the ceremonial house to his dwelling. In the afternoon the Máma and his assistants, as well as the men of status who will take an active part in the dance, leave the town and go to a nearby house, to the one belonging to the Máma or to one belonging to some Elder, where the masks and other ritual objects have been deposited beforehand. There they put on the costumes, ornaments, and masks, and at nightfall they come back to the town. Some men play large gourd trumpets announcing the arrival of the masks, but otherwise the participants proceed silently in single file. Upon arriving in the town, they then pass through its plaza and all enter the ceremonial house, walking first toward the east, then toward the west, south, and north, respectively, all with short steps, the knees bent, and making bows toward the “four corners of the world.” Meanwhile only the trumpets are played. This entrance of the masks is interpreted as a ceremonial greeting. Halting in the middle of the house, the masks pronounce the ritual greetings and commence a song accompanied by a slow dance, during which the dancers scarcely move from their places, but only rock the body from side to side or abruptly move the head from side to side. In the accompanying song the masks say that they were sent by the Universal Mother to visit the Kogi and to see if “all is in accord.” They ask if there are food and firewood, if all have confessed and fasted, and if the town has been cleaned. After a short time the participants remove the masks and place them on large tripods of stakes, which have been placed along the walls in the interior of the ceremonial house for this purpose. Then the gathering sits down on little benches and hammocks, and periods of conversation, singing and dancing performed by individuals and more of the nature of practicing, follow. Occasionally the Máma intervenes and directs the dancing, inviting all of the men to participate in it. They go on dancing this way through the night, sometimes with the masks, sometimes without them. Now maracas, trumpets, drums, and flutes accompany the songs, and the dancers stop facing in this direction, perhaps just turning their faces and maracas to this side. Thus “the masks speak with the directions” and “keep the bad at a distance and bring the good.” At the same time the Máma receives from the men, dancers or observers, the bundles of mineral dust, opens them, and blows their contents toward the four directions. Many times the men themselves do this and the Máma does not personally intervene. According to the time of year or the special object of the ceremony, they next repeat certain dances and songs, say, the dance of Kandjí, the dance of Namsíku, the dance of the rain, or the many dances which are performed in order to “be in accord” with the animals which damage the crops. In the festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, the next day is devoted to the dance of the mask of Surlí or the one of Nuikukúi (the Master of the East). At dawn the tripods with the masks are placed outside the ceremonial house with the faces turned toward the east “to greet the sun.” In the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, the mask of Surlí dances outside or inside the ceremonial house, his dance being accompanied by songs and the sound of the trumpets. At night the masks are brought in again, and the dances and songs continue until dawn, together with the offerings of mineral powder. In the free hours, however, the men devote themselves to small household tasks, eat from time to time, or toast coca leaves in the ceremonial house. No matter what the immediate object of the ceremony may be, whether “to turn the sun around” or “to arrange a rain-shower” (that is to say, to make it rain), the prime concern is always to keep sicknesses away. In the songs they speak of “making fences on the roads of sickness” or of “closing the doors to sickness,” and on occasion the dancers manipulate a small broom of leaves in each hand for the purpose of “sweeping away sickness” and “cleaning the pueblo.”",1,0,0,1,1,1
Ritual304,First Planting of the Year,"The first planting of the year, or in general the first planting in a new field, is always the occasion for a ceremony. After confession, divination, and delivery of the appropriate sewá, the Máma, together with the owner of the new planting, goes to the field, where before dawn he deposits upon a flat stone the seeds which it is intended to plant. When the sun comes up and the first rays fall on the seeds, these are regarded as fertilized, and it is thought that at this moment the sun cohabits with the seeds. Then these can be mixed with other seeds of the same plant, which, although not “fertilized” by the sun, now acquire this property. First of all, the seeds of maize and frijoles are “baptized,” because they are “children.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual305,First Harvest,"The first harvest is celebrated in the following manner: the owner of the crop first gathers from each plant a single fruit and in addition picks up from the ground at the foot of each plant “black, white, red, and blue earth.” He delivers these objects to the Máma, whose wife pulverizes the earth and wraps it in a maize leaf in the form of an offering, which is then deposited by the Máma in the sacred place. At the same time the latter sings to the Universal Mother or to the Mothers of the Yuca, Frijol, Maize, or whatever plant it may be, and expresses the satisfaction of the owner for the good harvest, but he also adds that the latter is afraid that “the food may harm him.” On the morning of the following day the wife of the Máma cooks the fruits which the man has brought and both the latter and the Máma eat them, after which he may continue harvesting. The concern that “the food may do harm” is always present in the ceremonies, and many times offerings are made for the sole purpose of avoiding this possible “harm,” which is explained by the Kogi as the danger of ailments of the digestive tract. During the harvest ceremony itself, when it is a matter of frijoles, maize, coca, or tobacco, some seeds are always kept to be used at the first planting period of the following year.

Ritual306,"Sahumar, Smoking","The act of smoking / sahumar, to smoke, to incense/ is important in almost all the ceremonies. For this purpose they use leaves of frailejon (Espeletia spp.), which grows abundantly in the paramos. First the Máma deposits at the foot of the bush an offering for the Master of the Frailejon, and then he plucks a few leaves, which are dried. To smoke during a ceremony, a piece of the dried leaf is taken in the left hand and lighted “to draw out the bad” and then is taken in the right one “to bring the good.” Circles are then described around objects, persons, or parts of the body with the burning piece, or it is carried around the house or place in question. If by chance the leaf does not burn well and goes out, it is interpreted to mean that one of the persons present has not “confessed well,” and possibly, according to the wishes of the Máma, the ceremony may be interrupted and the confession repeated. Small bits of resin from the plant itself are burned in the same way, but are used above all to cure sickness, making the smoke touch the affected part of the body. Smoking is of particular importance in the ceremonies of the life cycle, because it represents the purification of the individual; but it is also essential in the ceremonial of planting, especially in that of frijoles, maize, potatoes, and coca.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual307,Birth Ceremony,"LIFE CYCLE CEREMONIES The Kapauku birth ceremony is a rather simple affair. It consists of a feast given by the father in honor of his newly born child. Everyone who comes is treated to pork or the meat of rats or large marsupials. As a minimal requirement for this occasion the father is expected to prepare at least eight large pieces of pork, each weighing approximately six pounds, or ten large marsupials. He and his father, the paternal grandfather of the child, prepare the meat in one or several dopo, “cooking mounds,” steaming it together with fern leaves and other vegetables by means of preheated stones, in a bundle made of long reeds and pandanus leaves. The food is usually prepared in the emaage, the men’s common dormitory of the father’s house. When cooked, the meat is cut into small pieces and distributed to the male guests who either squat around the mound or, because of lack of space inside of the house, are gathered outside around the entrance. To the females, who stay in the women’s quarters in the rear of the building, the food is handed through special openings in the wall between the rooms. The people eat, talk, joke, and also discuss more serious political and economic issues. They may stay long into the night, some of them even spending the entire night with their proud host. A few days later the mother of the baby, in turn, gives a birth ceremony in honor of the child at her parents’ home. The procedure is the same except that it is not so conspicuous, and the mother of the child is the host. In the women’s quarters she prepares the food, which has been provided by her father and brothers, and passes it to the males gathered in the men’s dormitory in the front of the house.

The birth ceremony has actually two main functions: it celebrates the birth of the child, and thus introduces it formally into the society, and it is an occasion for the host to increase his economic and political prestige through generous and lavish distribution of food. The greater the number of guests and the greater the amount of food distributed, the greater the prestige of the happy father. Since his political importance will persist and his lavish spending on his guests will be reciprocated, the birth ceremony may be regarded as a profitable economic enterprise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual308,First Hair-Cutting Ceremony,"Except for the first hair-cutting ceremony the child is not subjected to any ceremonial treatment until he reaches puberty. The first hair-cutting ceremony is performed by the father who cuts the hair and shaves the child’s head with a bamboo knife. After this task is completed, and the hair hidden in the bush to protect the child against possible sorcery, the proud father gives a feast to his relatives and friends by treating them to steamed pork. The ceremony has no magical connotation; it celebrates the child’s growth and health and provides the father with an opportunity to prove his generosity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual309,Girls' Initiation,"Although there is no puberty ceremony for the boys, first menstruation becomes an important event in a girl’s life. At such an occasion her father, brother, parallel cousin, or (if she is married) her husband builds her daba owa, “a menstruation hut.” This simple structure consists of an oblong frame of sticks, leaned against two posts, and thatched over with grass and branches. The girl is expected to stay in the hut for two nights and two days during her first two menstruations. In the hut she is kept company by two or three older women who may be her mother, older sisters, brothers’ wives, mother’s sisters, or father’s sisters. During this time the girl is instructed by her custodians in marital duties, birth, child care, and in the observance of taboos connected with menstruation and womanhood. These taboos are of two categories: one is connected exclusively with the puberty ceremony, the other consists of food taboos which the girl, now considered an adult woman, will have to observe until the beginning of her menopause. Accordingly, during her first two menstruations she is forbidden to sleep, listen to legends, and leave the hut. Should she violate these taboos her punishment will be supernatural: if she sleeps she will suffer from nightmares; if she listens to legends she will have to bear the early death of her husband; if she leaves the hut, she will suffer a great illness. Sickness will also result, it is believed, from her eating any kind of wild game, banana, sugar cane, native beans, manioc, and certain kinds of caterpillars. The strictest supernatural sanction-that of inevitable death-is attached to the taboo, which prohibits the menstruating girl from washing herself or combing her hair. Throughout her child-bearing years she will have to refrain from eating teto, the red sugar cane, apuu, a type of yam, and two types of plantains called jigikago and kugou . These prohibitions are sanctioned supernaturally. Upon her violation of them her husband would inevitably die, and she would be held legally responsible for his death and would be punished by her husband’s relatives with execution. At the close of the ceremonial seclusion the girl is expected to hide the leaves into which she collected her menstrual blood in order to prevent a sorcerer from harming her by the use of contagious magic. At this time she also exchanges her loose girl skirt for an adult woman’s loin wrap.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual310,Ceremonial Collection of Bride Price,"In most societies the ceremony that marks the start of married life and is called a wedding, usually centers around the groom and the bride and their unification. One would seek such a wedding among the Kapauku in vain. The only ceremony distinguishing the marital life of the couple from their previous livelihood has nothing to do with their unification. Indeed, in most cases the bride, who is already living with her new husband, is absent. In some cases even the groom does not participate in the ritual. It actually consists of a ceremonial collection of the bride price, and of its transfer from the groom’s to the bride’s party. In its essence, then, it should be classified as an economic ceremony. The name wedding seems to be justified only because the transfer of the wealth does seal formally the marriage of the young couple, which invariably has been consummated some time before this occasion.

Although many Kapauku marriages start with elopement, a proper marriage procedure is expected to begin with a conference between the groom, who is usually supported by some of his relatives, and the bride’s kinsmen. The discussion between the suitor and the parents of the girl concentrates almost entirely upon the amount of the bride price. The welfare of the bride and her desire to marry her suitor are either taken for granted by both sides or, if an aversion of the girl to the man is well known and manifested by her explicit refusal, means are discussed by which to overcome her resistance and make the prospective union more acceptable to her. Such difficulties are frequently accompanied by economic repercussions: the prospective groom is asked to pay a bride price that is higher than would normally be the case. Sometimes the girl’s mother may actually safeguard her daughter from marrying an undesirable man by asking a forbiddingly high price. Fortunately, such difficulties are exceptional. Most discussions about the amount of bride price follow a proper courtship, and sometimes even a short period during which the couple have already lived together and cohabited.

After the price and the date of its payment have been agreed upon, and thus the preliminaries to a marriage concluded, the groom concentrates upon collection of the bride price. This consists of two parts: one, the main payment, composed of the old and most precious Kapauku cowries and pigs; and kade, an accessory to the first payment. Kade consists of inexpensive, introduced cowries, dedege “shell necklaces,” introduced glass beads, and a few manufactured articles, such as large shell necklaces, net bags, and axes. While the one part of the bride price is composed of the groom’s own cowries and a few large contributions made by his patrilineal relatives, the kade payment represents numerous small gifts contributed by the groom’s relatives and friends. The contributions to one are regarded as loans that have to be repaid in the future. The donations to kade are considered gifts which ought to be reciprocated, not upon the request of the donor, but in the form of kade when the donors or their close relatives are married.

From the ceremonial point of view there is also an important difference in the way the two payments are collected. The one part of the bride price is gathered informally from the paternal relatives of Ego, each single loan being transferred into the possession of the prospective groom individually and at a different time; all the kade gifts are payable ceremonially on a single specified day called kade makii naago (lit.: “the day when kade is laid down”). On this same day the already gathered one is publicly displayed on pandanus rain mats, and is later formally surrendered to the bride’s relatives. An average bride price consists of approximately 120 old Kapauku cowries, 120 introduced cowries, 300 glass trade beads, 3 dedege, “shell necklaces,” and 1 large male pig.

The preparations for the kade makii naago starts when the groom with his father and brothers visit their patrilineal relatives to collect loans toward the one . On these occasions the groom’s party announces the date of the “wedding” and invites to the occasion as many people as possible. When the ceremony draws near the groom and his close paternal relatives make special expeditions to various villages to remind everyone of the wedding date. The ceremony itself begins on the stated day at approximately ten o’clock in the morning when the father, brother, or mother of the groom places one or two rain mats in front of their house. Often the one, which has already been collected, is laid on the mat for public inspection. Early in the morning people begin to arrive from all directions in order to act either as contributors or simply as spectators to the ceremony. The bride’s relatives usually arrive all in one group. Their procession is augmented by many of their more distant relatives and friends who are prepared to support the bride’s kin in case a dispute over the amount of the bride wealth develops. At the gathering they usually keep together, squatting in one group near the mats with the bride wealth. Frequently the amount of shell displayed fails to meet their expectations, and one can immediately guess their displeasure from their somber expressions. Off and on one or several of them rise, move slowly to the mats to inspect the shell and, after having exchanged stern looks and a few derogatory remarks concerning the quality of the shell and the quantity of the gathered total, they return to their places.

At this time the contributors come forward to deposit their shell, beads, or necklaces on the mats. Female and male friends and relatives rise from the various squatting groups and silently approach the displayed bride price in order to add to it their own treasures. Since the expression on the faces of the members of the bride’s party remain stern, the local headmen begin to worry about trouble which may arise any time. In order to forego a dispute or even possible violence they make long appeals to the relatives of the groom, soliciting greater contributions by playing upon their relations to the “poor groom” and appealing to their pride, as generous and well-regarded individuals. They remind them that if the expectations of the bride’s party are not fully satisfied, the young man faces a possible loss of his bride. In order to make their appeal more dramatic, the headmen may start wainai, “a mad dance,” by stamping the ground with their feet and holding their left arms outstretched and the right arms bent at the elbow, as if they were ready to discharge imaginary arrows. While stamping furiously in a fast rhythm, they yell and scream their requests to the gathered audience. In their endeavor to increase the contributions the headmen are not alone. At some point the father, brothers, or paternal uncles of the bride join in the tumult with reproaches and insults hurled, not so much at the already insolvent groom and his close paternal relatives, as at their more distant kin and friends, trying to make them feel ashamed of their lack of generosity. If these performances fail to elicit the desired effect, the men of the bride’s party are forced into the mad dance themselves, thus posing a real threat of breaking up the negotiations. If this should happen the bride would be taken away from the groom and the latter charged with a payment of pituwo, a fine of 3 to 5 old Kapauku cowries paid for using the girl sexually out of wedlock. In extreme situations even an outright fight may develop from an unsatisfactorily conducted wedding procedure.

The atmosphere is filled with emotions, threats, danger, and especially with a grave challenge to the reputation of the friends and kin of the groom. No matter what they think about the adequacy of the already assembled bride wealth, they may find themselves reaching into the corners of their netted purses and pulling out additional precious shell and necklaces. As if in a trance they move to the mat, squat, and surrender their treasures to the displayed bride price, perhaps to regret their generous deeds later, when they have cooled off. As more and more individuals experience this ecstatic generosity, the loud appeals and voices of the headmen and the bride’s relatives soften, and their angry looks are finally replaced by very faint smiles of satisfaction. Their pleasure over the collected bride price is not, however, made explicit. The Kapauku are never supposed to show too openly their enjoyment over a business deal because one can never tell whether the other party might not make an even more attractive offer. The groom, now assured of the success of his wedding, dries his tear-stained eyes and presents his new in-laws with the promised one or two pigs. The whole ceremony is concluded by approximately three in the afternoon. Individuals who contribute after this time, it is believed, would violate a supernatural taboo and, as a consequence, be afflicted with a disease.

Waka edai, buying a wife among the Kapauku, is certainly not equated with buying a chattel such as a pig. The payment of the bride price has several important social as well as economic aspects. The mother’s part of the bride price (which consists of glass beads and shell necklaces) provides her with an important means for elevating her status. By lending part of her newly acquired wealth to her husband or sons she makes them dependent upon her. From now on they had better respect her wishes or she may ask for the return of the loans. The payment received by the bride’s brother provides him with the means to buy himself a wife. The father of the bride, who in the Kamu Valley is not supposed to keep anything from the price paid for his daughter, referees the adequacy of the bride price and its distribution. Thus he reconfirms his importance as the head of his family, and earns admiration from his sons as well as from the public for his skill in making the groom’s party pay a high amount. The contributors to the bride price gain not only public prestige for their generosity, and gratitude from the groom for their help, but they also have had a good opportunity to make a safe loan which is well publicized and is secured by a mortgage placed upon bride prices to be paid in the future for the daughters of the bride whom they have “helped to buy.” The gratitude of the groom to his creditors is so great that it finds formalized expression in the address that the groom is expected to use from now on: he has to call all these creditors naitai, “my father.” He also is expected to give unqualified assistance to them in their future political and legal disputes. To a rich groom the payment of the bride price offers an opportunity of increasing his prestige by paying more than the amount originally agreed upon. He thus not only enhances his political status but also strengthens the marital bond, because the higher the bride price, the less chance there is that the wife’s relatives will side with her in marital arguments or support her in obtaining a divorce. Should she leave her husband they would have to return the entire bride price. Such a repayment would certainly represent an economic loss, because they could hardly expect to collect as large a sum from another suitor. In this respect, then, the appropriate or high bride price has a stabilizing effect upon the marriage.",1,777,0,0,1,1
Ritual311,Prior to Burial,"The life cycle of a Kapauku individual is concluded by a funeral ceremony; as soon as the soul leaves the body, relatives of the deceased give a formal expression to their grief. They weep, eat ashes, cut off their fingers, tear their garments and net carrying bags, and smear their faces and bodies with mud, ashes, or yellow clay. The most conspicuous manifestation of grief is a loud sing-song lamentation that is called jii jii tai . In order to give more publicity to his sorrow a bereaved mourner climbs a hill or a cliff where he laments and weeps as loudly as his vocal cords will allow. His jii jii tai is carried by the winds through the valley, announcing the sad news to all the relatives and friends in remote villages. Obedient to the message, the relatives smear their faces or even their bodies with clay, mud, or ashes. They hurry to the place of death and rush into the house of the deceased; wailing loudly, they beat the hearth in the men’s dormitory with a long stick. They believe that in so doing they punish the spirit of hearth, who dwells underneath the stone fireplace, and is believed to consume the body in the grave. Its ghoulish orgy is manifest to the Kapauku by the decay of the corpse. Sooner or later one of the maagodo noogei, best friends of the son of the deceased,” arrives and presents his mourning friend with a large pig. This is killed in the afternoon and its meat distributed to the mourners and their friends during a funeral feast in the evening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual312,Pre-Juwo Ritual,"ECONOMIC CEREMONIES By far the most spectacular and elaborate Kapauku ceremony is juwo, “the pig feast.” This is a rather protracted affair comprising several major events and innumerable night dancing parties. The whole cycle of a pig feast usually lasts several months. It starts with the decision of a rich man, preferably a headman, to sponsor a feast. He is motivated by the prospect of profits, and by political considerations. By giving a feast he not only sells quantites of meat and earns the much desired shell money, entertains himself in singing and dancing, and gains prestige from his generous loans of pork but, by a successful event, he also undermines the popularity of his rivals within and without the confederacy. Furthermore a spectacular pig feast enhances the reputation of the community, and ultimately that of the whole political federation, and shames the rival political groups. In outdoing the enemy a sponsor of a successful pig feast is considered to have accomplished a “patriotic and moral” deed and often is regarded by his fellow confederates as some sort of a national hero.

Because of the complexity of the undertaking and the numerous tasks to be accomplished the main sponsor, called juwo ipuwe (lit.: “the owner of the pig feast”) seeks other rich individuals who are willing to act as cosponsors of the affair. If the main sponsor is known for his riches, generosity, and influence he has no trouble in finding people willing to help him. His reputation alone assures the success of the undertaking, of monetary profits, and of a gain in personal prestige. The cosponsors are usually paternal relatives of a younger generation, or younger relatives of the sponsor’s own generation (for example So, BrSo, FaBrSoSo, FaSiSoSo, FaBrSoSoSo, yBr, yFaSiSo). The first role of the cosponsors is to secure the help of the young and poor members of the community in making planks, cutting poles and thatch, collecting rattan, and transporting these building materials to the site on which the dance and feast houses will be erected.

After the building material has been gathered together, the main sponsor initiates the building of the dance house by a magical rite which is supposed to assure the success of the feast and bring lots of money to its sponsors. Early in the morning on the taka wei naago, the day when the people start building the dance house (lit.: “the day when the forked sticks of the foundation of the dance house are stuck into the ground”) the main sponsor goes to the forest where he cuts a tall onage, “a willowlike tree.” Over the stump of this freshly cut tree he prays to the Creator to grant success to the feast and bring lots of cowrie shell to the sponsors. After this prayer (which has a definitely magical significance) is concluded, the performer sacrifices the intestines of a rat by placing them on the stump. Then the sponsor with his aides, shouting and yelling for joy, run with the cut onage tree to the building site. There they plant it, together with a ti plant, into the ground next to the place where the main front post that is to carry the ridgepole will be erected. Next to the planted onage tree a hole is dug into which rat intestines are deposited, the action being properly accompanied by a magical spell. The hole is then closed by driving into it a single end of a forked stick that will be the first support for the frame of the spring floor of the dance house.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Ritual313,"Juwo, The Pig Feast","After this proper initiation the people begin to build the dance house. This has a rectangular floor plan, its dimensions being approximatly 7 by 6 meters. It consists of an elevated spring or jumping floor of long flexible sticks, plank walls, and a gabled roof, thatched with pandanus leaves, whose highest point is about 6 meters above the ground. In front of this structure is a vestibule formed by an extension of the gabled roof and the sidewalls. Doors, about 2.5 meters wide, left in the front walls of the vestibule and the dance hall, provide the entrances. The vestibule serves as a rain protection for the dance audience, and fires are also built there in order to provide light and warmth during the cool nights. To provide additional illumination and heat, two rows of small openings (approximately 40 centimeters wide) are left in the spring floor along the two side walls for small fires to be kindled underneath the elevated floor. In addition to the single dance house, every sponsor and cosponsor of the feast builds his own juwo owa, “house.” This is a simple oblong structure with vertical plank walls and a gabled roof, thatched with long pandanus leaves. The structure serves as a dormitory for the guests from distant villages, as a storage space for the owner’s pigs, as a slaughter house and, finally, as the place where meat is sold, cooked, and consumed.

When the construction of these houses is completed, a significant period of about three months begins, during which groups of men and women from any village or confederacy may come to spend a night in dancing and singing. This practice is called ema uwii, “going to the dance house.” This dancing period is formally opened by putu duwai naago, the day during which meat is distributed by the sponsors to their friends and relatives free of charge, and during which the date of the main and final feast is announced. The day is actually a feast in its own right. The sponsors slaughter about eight pigs and distribute small pieces of pork to the multitude. The pigs are killed in the feast houses early in the morning. Groups of people, representing a village, lineage, sublineage, or even a confederacy, arrive from all directions, running, yodeling, and jumping over the deep mud holes and ditches filled with rain water. Upon their arrival each group performs the familiar waita tai, the counterclockwise circular dance, which they follow with tuupe . This is a treading dance accompanied by a repetitious song, during which the whole group of people, who are pressed against each other, tread clockwise. Then the people rush into the dance house to jump on the spring floor and to sing an ugaa song. This performance starts with barking cheers, while the people, standing on one place, bend their knees in a fast rhythm and make the spring floor go up and down. After a few minutes the singing subsides and an individual begins a solo song that, after a sentence or two, becomes a duet in which a “helper” answers the singer in counterpoint fashion. This duet, lasting only two to three minutes, is followed by a chorus in which the whole group participates. The ugaa song is completed by making a barking sound and rocking the spring floor, this introduces another solo singer with his composition. Although the solo, with the duet part, is a poem composed by the solo singer, the chorus part of the ugaa is traditional, and may belong to several well-defined types. In his solo performance the initiator of an ugaa song suggests which of the familiar types he desires the group to sing. Each of these songs has an important meaning that often has social implications. In an ugaa song a man may, for example, mourn his dead relatives, ask an individual for a monetary loan or best friendship, propose a date or marriage to a girl, or challenge a rival to a legal dispute.

After a few of these songs have been presented, a group moves out from the dance house to make room for others who have arrived and are dancing outside. At about nine o’clock in the morning pieces of raw meat are distributed to the male visitors. Afterward, cooking mounds are made in which the entrails of the slaughtered pigs are steamed. Thus prepared, the entrails are cut into small pieces by the sponsors or their close relatives, and distributed to the women and children. In the afternoon the feast is concluded by a conference held by the sponsors of the feast who, aided by experienced and influential advisors, decide upon the time of the final and main feast, which is called juwo degii naago . The date may be set anywhere between 60 and 480 days from this conference. Most frequently, however, a period of three months is considered adequate.

This formal opening begins a period during which groups from any village may come in the evening and spend the whole night dancing and singing in the ema, the dance house. These nightly entertainments are among the most enjoyable pastimes of young and old Kapauku alike. The young men, in order to impress the girls, prepare themselves properly for the occasion. They paint their faces with red ochre and soot mixed with grease, comb their hair, put on armlets and fancy necklaces, and adorn their bodies with flowers and colorful shrubbery which they insert under their armlets and into their net carrying bags. For defense as well as decorative purposes they carry fancy bows and arrows. They embellish their hair with bonnets of cassowary feathers or with hairpins which hold the gorgeous bird-of-paradise plumes. The girls put on new loin wraps and wear as many shell and glass-bead necklaces as they can carry. On some girls these ornaments are so numerous as to resemble colorful breastplates. The men, followed by the women, gather in the late afternoon at an open place in their village. There they perform the waita tai dance, followed by juu tai, “yodeling in a barking fashion,” and depart swiftly for the village with the dance house.

The group arrives at sunset, yodeling and cheering. Not losing a moment they release their accumulated energy by waita tai and tuupe dances, performed in front of the dance house. Afterward they rush inside to sing their ugaa songs and jump on the spring floor. The floor-jumping keeps up all night. When it becomes dark the fires are lit beneath the floor to provide some warmth and a scanty illumination. Women appear with their burning torches; among them are girls from the village whose male inhabitants undertook the dance expedition, and from the local village who are eager to join the dancing group. Now the dance house and the gathered singing and swinging multitude present a fascinating picture. The place is crowded beyond imagination-literally several hundred people may be packed into the relatively small structure. Most of the spring floor is occupied by the group of dancing men who are pressed against each other in the center. Above this group of deeply bronzed bodies, which in the torch light glisten with grease and sweat, rises a forest of bows and arrows that the dancers hold upright in their hands. The women, carrying lighted torches, march counterclockwise around the leaping men. The rest of the space is filled with male and female spectators. The place is dimly illuminated by the flickering torches and by the small fires that burn beneath the jumping-floor. The vestibule is crowded with spectators and tired dancers, who warm themselves around small fires or roast a few sweet potatoes. Those who desire a more substantial meal or want to take a brief nap retire to the neighboring feast houses where large fires provide more warmth and comfort.

In this fashion the people spend the whole night. One ugaa song, accompanied by the jumping dance, follows the other. They carry important meanings and have social consequences. The natives learn from them the news and problems of the village. They also discover important relationships between individuals that otherwise would remain undetected. One can realize then that such a dance is important and interesting, as well as entertaining to the people. In our Western cultural terms, it is as though one were dancing, singing, listening to new poetry, witnessing disputes and matchmaking, reading the newspaper, and participating in a cocktail party-all at the same time. Indeed, the significance of a pig feast and its ugaa songs can hardly be overestimated.

Of the various types of ugaa songs with their various social implications, the most important for the young men and women are those in which a singer proposes a date or marriage to a girl. The composition is usually a nice poem by which the singer alludes to the beauty of his girl and asks her for a date at a given place or for marriage, by requesting her to leave with him for his home village. The girl to whom the song is addressed is present in the audience or in the group of women who carry the torches. If she rejects the proposal she angrily throws away the torch and without delay leaves the dance house; if she continues to carry the torch or remains standing in the audience it signifies her acceptance of the offer. Later during the night the two young people steal away and either have a date, which means having sexual intercourse in the bush or, if marriage was the object of the accepted proposal, they run to the boy’s village. The close paternal relatives of the couple, then, try to make the necessary arrangements for an early payment of the bride price.

This formal arrangement for dates and marriages serves, however, only a few of the young men. Most of them come to the dance to acquaint themselves with girls and to flirt with them informally. The setting is ideal for such an undertaking. The light is dim, the place is crowded, and the girls with their torches have to push through the dancers on one side and the onlookers on the other. As they proceed in a single or double file, the boys have plenty of opportunity to exchange looks and words or jokes with the girls. If a girl seems to be receptive to such approaches, a boy becomes encouraged. Next time she passes he stands in her way so that she has to push him aside in order to keep pace with the other females. This provides the young man with an excuse to retaliate with a push on her next turn around the dance floor. He feels fully successful if the girl screams, or pushes him away, or slaps him. But a rebuke, or silence, or an unpleasant look from the young lady must be interpreted as displeasure, and the boy is well advised to try his suit elsewhere. The bright-colored hairpins of the boys provide another means for flirtation. The girls, who like to have such pins as souvenirs and decoration, snatch them, as they pass, from the coiffures of the boys. The boys, in turn, try to regain their ornaments when the girls reappear in the moving circle. If the torches go out and sudden darkness envelops the crowd, a few bold young men take the opportunity to grab the passing maidens by their breasts. For such an approach the men are struck with fists, slapped, or sometimes even thrown to the floor by the infuriated women. Despite the blows and the resulting bruises these boys feel fine and are regarded by their friends as the heroes of the evening. Their successful exploitation of the darkness will constitute an important contribution to local gossip for the next few weeks.

This is not to assume that it is always the boys who make the first advances to the opposite sex. The pushing and snatching of ornaments is often initiated by the girls themselves. A girl can even be bold enough to propose a date and the inevitable sexual intercourse. The girl does this by secretly slipping a cooked sweet potato into the boy’s hand. He understands well what this small token of love means and he watches the girl carefully. When she leaves the dance house he inconspicuously follows her into the darkness, to spend the whole, or part of the night in collecting the highest reward a nightdance can offer to a young Kapauku.

As the day of the main and final feast draws close, the dances in the ema become more and more frequent. Some nights are reserved for the women, when they dance and sing the ugaa songs, and the men provide light with the torches. The dancing intensity culminates during the night preceding juwo degii naago, “the main feast.” During the first half of the night the men dance and sing, and the women provide the torchlight; in the second half of the night the roles are reversed. After sunrise, as soon as the heavy dew on the grass and foliage dries out, the sponsors of the feast appear with their pigs. The animals are slaughtered with bows and arrows, or are sometimes clubbed to death, and the butchering begins. The cut pieces of meat and entrails are stored in small partitions in the back of the juwo owa, “the feast house,” where the people usually go in order to buy it from the pig owners. All during the morning groups of people come from various villages. Upon their arrival they perform the waita tai and tuupe dances, and follow these with one or two ugaa songs in the dance house. When this is done they disperse in order to conduct business. Most of them come either to buy or to sell something. Pigs, tied to poles, are brought by many people who are not sponsors of the feast, but who use the occasion as an excellent opportunity to market their produce. They select a particular spot in the tall grass where they butcher their animals and start selling the meat. Small or large clusters of prospective buyers gather around the places where pork is being sold. Many of the people are not actually buyers, but come to claim repayment for pork that they have “loaned” in the past. Or they may be “borrowers of pork,” who promise to repay in kind in the future.

The trading is by no means limited to meat. The people sell and buy for shell money all kinds of products. The most frequent articles traded are pieces of salt, bundles of inner bark for making strings, bow strings of rattan vines, artistically netted and decorated carrying bags, bamboo containers, bird feathers, and ornaments of various kinds. The buyers and traders argue about the quality of the shell money and merchandise, bargain about the prices, and dispute the offers made by their competitors who try to undersell them. Almost everyone enjoys the feast. Those who have concluded satisfactory transactions function as audience to interesting trade disputes, or enjoy themselves by gossiping with their friends and relatives, some of whom they may not have seen for a long time. The politically-minded individuals, especially the headmen, discuss problems concerning interfederational disputes and possible warfare. The Kapauku pig feast is a place where new alliances are agreed upon, possible war plans are worked out, difficult disputes endangering peaceful coexistence are discussed, deliberated, and often settled, and where peace between enemies is formally concluded. In addition, many a war had its origin at such an “economic gathering.”

In the late afternoon the trading is concluded and small groups of people, heavy with purchased meat and artifacts or rich in shell money, slowly return to their homes. Many individuals, especially relatives of the local villagers, decide to spend the night in the community. There they will be treated to steamed pork and entertained by discussions which most probably will last late into the night.

A Kapauku pig feast is an impressive affair. On such an occasion there may be as many as 2000 visitors, and the slaughtered pigs may be counted in the hundreds. The trade turnover, in terms of shell money, may be quite considerable. Generally it can be said that the greater the number of visitors and slaughtered pigs, the greater the prestige the sponsors of the feast will acquire. Successful feasts are talked over and remembered by the people for years. Because of its social and political consequences a Kapauku pig feast, although a trading ceremony in nature, surpasses in its significance the scope of economy and becomes one of the central events around which Kapauku public affairs are patterned.",1,1,0,1,1,1
Ritual314,"Tapa, Fund-Raising Ceremony","Other social events have developed among the Kapauku in which the economic aspect is primary, and the ceremonial aspect is always secondary in importance, sometimes being almost rudimentary. These events are of two different types. One is called tapa, “the fund-raising ceremony,” the other is dedomai, “a pig market.” Whereas dedomai appears to be a purely economic affair with only traces of ceremonial observances, tapa does preserve ceremonial overtones and thus appears as an intermediate between juwo, “the pig feast,” and dedomai, “the pig market.”

In my first monograph on the Kapauku I translated the term tapa as “a ceremony of the transfer of dabe uwo, ” (the reward paid for avenging the death of a relative). During my subsequent research in 1959 and 1962 it became clear that the translation was incorrect. In 1954-1955 the Kapauku still lived in pure aboriginal condition in which wars were part of their normal life. Consequently, there were so many people killed and avenged in the frequent conflicts, that at all the tapa ceremonies I witnessed during my first research period the gathering and the transfer of the dabe uwo, the blood reward, figured as the essential feature of the ceremony. However, with the enforced pacification, and the resulting scarcity of opportunities for avenging the death of warriors, the sole purpose of the several tapa ceremonies I witnessed in 1959 and 1962 was the gathering of money for purposes other than payment of the blood reward. Therefore the true essence of the tapa ceremony is to gather funds for any purpose and is not limited to payment of the blood reward.

Like the pig feast, a tapa ceremony has a sponsor who is interested in it as an economic venture; he finds some cosponsors, who need money for their own purposes (such as buying a pig for breeding, buying a wife, or payment of mune to the foster father for his care and education). At an informal gathering a date for the tapa ceremony is set, usually within 180 to 360 days from the day of the agreement. Unlike the pig feast, no special structures are erected; however, from the time of the announcement of the tapa until the day it takes place people from various villages do come in groups for night dances, which take place in the open on a lawn in the village of the tapa sponsor. These dances are like those described for the pig feast with one very important difference: since there is no dance house, no ugaa songs are sung. The dancers, after an initial waita tai dance, spend the night in enjoying tuupe, the treading dance, which is accompanied by monotonous, repetitive, but pleasing songs. Since these songs, unlike those of the ugaa type, have no meaning and no social consequences, the dances are far less significant than those of the pig feast and, consequently, are enjoyed mostly by the younger generation.

The tapa ceremony itself takes place in the village of the sponsor and lasts only one day. It resembles a pig feast in that people come in groups, perform the waita tai and tuupe dances, bring their pigs for slaughter and for sale, and trade their manufactured items for shell money. Unlike the pig feast, the focus of this event is the collecting activity of the sponsors of the tapa . They make long speeches in which they exhort their relatives and friends to contribute to the funds they are soliciting. Sometimes they even perform odija ugaa, a dance consisting of tiny jumps with bent knees and with legs held together. This performance is accompanied by a song in which the potential contributors are asked to be generous. It is especially the cross-cousins, the in-law and maternal relatives, and the friends of the sponsors who grant the most extensive loans; in order to exhibit their generosity they bring their contributions, especially those to the dabe uwo, in a procession in which the shell and beads, strung on long inner-bark strings, are carried suspended from long forked sticks. Upon arrival each group of contributors approaches the sponsors at a treading pace. Very often a woman, who treads backward while facing the carriers of the money, heads the group. The procession ends by a waita tai dance, after which the contribution is ceremonially surrendered to the sponsors. In order to make the fund-raising ceremony more attractive the sponsor, and sometimes also the cosponsors, may kill one or several pigs and distribute some of the meat as gifts. The gifts of meat are offered especially to those individuals who come to the ceremony to repay a loan or to grant a new one to one of the sponsors. The fund-collecting ceremony is concluded late in the afternoon when most of the contributors and traders return home in small groups; a few others remain in the village overnight to enjoy freshly steamed pork and friendly conversation.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual315,Healing Ritual,"The most frequent and the most important types of white magical rites are those concerned with curing disease. After a man has been “attacked by an evil spirit which tries to remove his soul” he turns for help to a shaman. The practitioner, applying all his skill and knowledge, tries to expel the evil spirit from the body of the patient either by bribing it or by forcing it out with the help of his own guardian spirit. Almost every magical cure that I have witnessed differed from the others in individual selection of the elements of the magical rites, over-all organization of the procedure, sequence of the technique, and wording of the particular spells. The shamans also differ in their eloquence and their knowledge of lore and the use of the various paraphernalia. However, they all make use of certain elements of magical performance that are the property of the profession. Some of the most frequently used and, therefore, important elements of curative magic follow. Every magical procedure that I have observed started with a prayer by the shaman to the sun and moon Creator and to the shaman’s guardian spirits. During the performance that follows, a shaman invariably uses a magically powerful plant. Its selection often depends on the diagnosis of the cause of the disease. As a rule the evil spirits are associated with particular plants. However, the most generally used plant, often utilized next to that which a particular spirit requires, is the green variety of the ti plant. Its stem, with a few leaves left at its end, is a repellent of most of the evil spirits. The shaman carries it around his patient, touches the head and other parts of the body with it, shakes it furiously, and thus expels the spirit that causes the disease. Very often the plants are used together with glowing embers. The whole bundle, consisting of both ingredients, is moved counterclockwise, followed immediately by clockwise circles, around the patient’s head. This performance is almost always accompanied by involved, repetitive spells, uttered rapidly by the shaman, and by his spitting on the embers as well as around the patient. Since water is believed to have a purifying force the shaman and the sick man apply it freely to different parts of their bodies. The spirits are almost always bribed by the plants and glowing embers —augmented by sacrificial small birds, rats, or intestines of some larger animals—into leaving the body of the patient. Toward the end of the rite these offerings are hung on a pole, or thrown behind the shaman into the bush. The procedure may be combined with performances during which a shaman extracts, by sleight of hand, an evil object from the patient’s body. The practitioner may also try to recapture the patient’s soul on the end of the ti plant broom and reintroduce it into the sick man’s body. The magician’s trance, as well as his dreams, may also be employed in the cure. Through these the shaman claims to have learned the cause of the illness as well as the remedy for it. At the end of a magical ceremony he suggests some special observances that the patient must follow as a continuation of his cure. For a period of time, or for the rest of his life, he may be ordered to refrain from eating certain species of food plants or animals. As condition for a complete recovery the patient may be requested to manifest his generosity. This consists usually of killing a pig and distributing its meat free to the public. Sometimes he may also be asked to set aside a certain quantity of cowries for his son’s inheritance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual316,"Besudi, Healing Ritual","Besudi/Longhouse Tarum

The ceremony took place in Tarum, the home of Manang Jabing on 23. July 1974. Joseph Inggoi who took me to the Manang, was present on this evening and served as translator of my questions. There was no Pagar api built for this ceremony.

The family of the sick child prepares a lizard out of rice (see ill.) and puts the basket covered with a man's sarong into a corner of the bilek.

Manang Jabing takes a seat in the bilek and looks through a quartz-crystal (batu-ilau) into the flame of an oil lamp. By doing this he is able to find the soul of the child. Covered with an ikat (pua kumbu) he sings himself into trance and travels with the “rice-lizard” into the world of the antus (ghosts). As they arrive there the “rice-lizard” confuses the ghosts and enables the manang to catch the soul. The “rice-lizard” has to be killed now to prevent the ghosts from coming to the longhouse. The manang hits the “animal” on its head.

Awakening from trance he shows a little stone (as visible sign of the soul) and places it on the crown of the head of the sick child.

In this ceremony and similarily in the following healings the discrepancy between the text and the visible actions is striking. Therefore it appears very important to me to show the performance in detail in photos to give a complete impression of the ceremonies.

Going to the manang's festival
Who are blessing the betelnut flower.
Up jumps the semujok fish
He comes from a deep pool in the river
Tebalang fish also has the intention of going to the festival
Going up the rapids in the river.
The runtu fish come swarming out from under the overhanging bank
The tunggal fish (lonely fish) are shivering, moving through the rapids to come to the
festival
They dare to risk their lives to quarrel with the dead
Although this is the dry season, and the river is shallow
The ensluai fish are also included
No wonder they are laughing, they have got flat teeth!
They visit the celebration where the betelnut flower is being blessed (rocked like a
baby)
No wonder they move slowly, bringing the medicine for health on their fins
They don't worry about death going up the rapids
(all animals help, he gets all the cures)
Then come the betutu and the keli fish
Going up to the festival for the month (moon)
To be with the manang who is rocking an open betelnut flower
All are going to the celebration with the manang
Through deep river, shallow river (look for the soul)
They come at night, bringing “waterstone” medicine
To rub the teeth of the wave with.
They don't mind risking their lives while talking to the death
With whistling sound they disappear, backwards, never to return.
The pelukong fish comes flapping along
Under the jointed edges (tongues and grooves, carpentry)
(listens open-mouthed)
Listen to the manang blessing the closed betelnut flower.
That's why he is happy to go to the celebration to protect it (soul)
Carrying the “cold stone” charm, necklace dangling.
He is not frightened of what may happen to him
The manang is brave, confident to recover the soul
Betutu fish is in the river pool
All come to the festival, they will go to look for charms
Sheltered behind some trees (shrubs)
There is skin sickness near the rib cage (whose?)
In the dream someone pokes his ribs
The fish is jumping up and down.
This looks like a girl from Nanga Dabok
With waving hair, with finger-rings made of the shoot of apong
Making a noise like that of the woodpecker.
The buing fish comes, flapping
Laughing, opening this sharp-toothed mouth wide (serrated edge)
The manang is blessing the twigs of the betelnut flower
He is going to the celebration, equipped with the good charm
Well equipped, his body yellow (fish-yang)
All the fish come up the pebbly river beach together, beautifully
More and more follow, large crowds
Just like the sunset

General Questions to 6.2.1. and 6.2.2.
1 “At what time are the various ceremonies performed?” Preferably at the beginning of the sickness, before it comes to a dangerous stage. It is up to the patient and members of his family to decide whether or not they need a manang.

2 “Why is one particular ceremony performed; and not another?” The manang knows which type of ceremony is suitable for each kind of sickness. He was taught how to select the suitable ceremony to be performed - even before he became a manang.

3 “Is there any special reason why some things are used for each kind of pagar api? Could the manang choose as he likes, or does he have to follow any tradition in this matter? Is there any special kind of pagar api for the following ceremonies: Besudi, Belimbu”.

Yes, the manang believes there is a special reason for this. He has to follow tradition. I should say there is no special pagar api, for Besudi and Belimbu are the same. In some cases the items required may be replaced by others if the patients don't have them available, or they may be omitted. Some items are not compulsory, but being a manang he has to see that the things recommended by tradition are observed.

Bangun is performed at the initiation of becoming a manang; also when the manang himself is sick and he feels that it is necessary.

Belimbu is performed when a person or family have had bad dreams. The manang believes that bad dreams may eventually result in sickness. To prevent this, Belimbu is recommended by the manang as a protection.

Besudi is held when a person is sick.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual317,"Pelians, Healing Ritual","Manangism in Borneo

WHERE all rational conception of the causes of disease and of medicine is entirely absent, magical ceremonies, incantations, pretensions to supernatural powers in the cure of the sick have the whole field before them; whilst fear and anxiety in cases of illness lead to an eager credulity which clutches at any projected means of cure, however absurd in themselves: hence among the lower races of mankind, the medicine man is an important personage and as indispensable to the wellbeing of Society. The Dyaks of Borneo are no exception; they have their “Manangs.” And as these are not reluctant to communicate their medical beliefs, and as their belief is also the belief of the Dyaks generally, it is not difficult to set down a general view of their theories, as well as their practices. The peculiar attribute of the Manang is the possession of mysterious powers rather than special knowledge.

But though the Manang function is procured for all serious ailments, yet the treatment of the sick is not confined to it. Dyaks use a few simples as outward applications, things composed for the most part of leaves of plants. The betelnut and pepper leaf mixture is also used as an outward application for almost any malady. Some man, supposed to be lucky, is called in; he chews a quantity of this hot and stimulant mixture in his mouth, leans over the body, and squirts the saliva over the affected part, and gently rubs it in with his fingers. Dyaks in a burning fever with acute headache will be seen with their foreheads smeared over with it. And this dirty mess is supposed to possess great virtue in promoting the growth of newly born children, whose bodies, up to a certain age, are half covered with daily applications of it by their mothers.

Other unprofessional modes of cure are practised by certain Dyaks, to whom, through the medium of dreams, benevolent spirits have made known medicinal charms for special diseases, such as pebbles, roots and leaves of various plants, bits of wood, and even feathers and scraps of matting, etc. The pebbles are rubbed in water which is applied externally; the woods, feathers and matting are burnt, and the ashes applied.

But these are of very minor importance compared with the functions of the Manangs, who alone are believed to wield power over the malignant spirits which cause sickness. All internal maladies are supposed to be inflicted by the passing, or the touch of demons inimical to mankind. What is the matter with so and so? you ask. He is “pansa utei,” “something passed him;” he is struck by a demon who desires to carry off his soul to the other world. Consistent with this idea, somebody is required who can cope with the evil spirit and prevent the soul from being hurried away. And the Manang comes forth as the man, ready to charm, cajole or kill the spirit, and rescue the departing soul from his clutches by a performance which is called “Belian.” Some years ago a Dyak lad was sleeping in my house, and in the early morning was seized with epileptic fits. The friends came and took him away, and soon the Manangs were walking round and chanting over him. After the function was over, the chief Manang gave out that a party of spirits returning from a hunting expedition, caught sight of the lad, and thrush a spear at him; but that had they recognised the house as mine, they would have spared him.

Nearly all diseases then are believed to arise from ghostly causes, or at least to be accompanied by sneaking evil spirits; and the sorcerer must deal with these intangible and demoniacal influences. But some maladies are too terrible for even his mystical powers. Nothing is more thoroughly believed to be the direct personal influence of evil spirits than the epidemic scourges of cholera and small-pox; but seldom will Manangs go near a case of either; probably a consciousness of the utter futility of their efforts, combined with fear of infection, have induced them to assert that such cases do not come within the reach of their powers. Other means must be resorted to, among which propitiatory sacrifices and offerings predominate.

The stock in trade of a Manang is a “lupong,” a medicine box, generally made of bark-skin, which is filled with “obat,” medicinal charms, consisting of scraps of wood and bark, bits of curiously twisted roots, and odd knotty sticks, pebbles, fragments of quartz, and possibly a coloured glass marble, cum multis aliis . These charms are either inherited, or revealed by the spirits in dreams as possessed of medicinal virtue. The coloured glass marble, where not previously known, is an “obat” of great power. On one occasion in my neighbourhood years ago, a travelling Manang belauded the efficacy of one of these toys of civilisation, saying, I think, that it was the “egg of a star,” and that he had given the whitemen's doctor two dollars for it. Among the audience was a Dyak to whose son I had given a similar marble, and he said: “may we see this great medicine?” The Manang produced it. “Oh,” said the other, “the Tuan Padri yonder has got plenty of these. He gave my boy one.” The Manang speedily replaced the marble, and changed the conversation to a more unsuspicious direction. If an unscrupulous trader were to take into the interior of Borneo a cargo of these marbles with holes bored through them to enable them to be worn round the neck, he would make enormous profits. One which I had given to a child was afterwards sold for a brass gong worth three dollars.

Another and a principal “obat” contained in the “lupong” is “Batu Ilau,” “Stone of Light,” a bit of quartz chrystal, by virtue of whose mysterious power the Manang is enabled to perceive the character of different diseases, and to see the soul, and catch it after it has wandered away from the body: for it is an article of Manang faith that in all sicknesses the soul leaves the body, and wanders about at greater or less distance from its mortal tenement; if it can be caught within a returnable point, and recovered before having proceeded too far on the journey to Hades, well and good; if not, the patient dies.

The Manang never carries his own “lupong,” but the people who fetch him must carry it for him. He comes to the house in the evening; for he never performs in daylight unless the case is very bad, and the people pay him well for it; to “belian” during the day, he says, is difficult and dangerous work. Sitting down by the patient, after some inquiries, he takes out of his “lupong” a boar's tusk, or a smooth pebble, or some other “obat” of magical virtue, and gently strokes the body with it; then he gravely looks into his “Batu Ilau” to diagnose the character of the disease and the condition of the soul, and to discover the proper “pelian” needed for its restoration and then tells them what sort of function he would prescribe. If there be several Manangs called in, the leader undertakes the preliminary examination, the rest giving their assent. This done they retire to the outside public verandah of the house, where has been prepared a “Pagar Api,” which is a long handled spear fixed blade upwards in the middle of the verandah with a few leaves of some sort tied round it, and having at its base the “lupongs” of each Manang. Why it is called “Pagar Api,” “Fence of Fire,” no one has been able to tell me. Then the leader begins a long monotonous drawl at the rate of about two words a minute, which, however, increases in velocity as the performance proceeds; the rest either chanting with him, or joining in at choruses, or may be singing antiphonally with him, all squatting on the floor. After a tiresome period of this dull drawling, they stand up, and march with slow and solemn step round the ‘Pagar Api,” the monotonous chant slackening or quickening as they march the whole night through with only one interval for a feed in the middle of the night. The patient simply lies on his mats and listens. Most of the matter chanted in these Manang performance is unmeaning rubbish. They begin by describing in prolix and grandiose language all the parts of a Dyak house; but how such an irrelevant descant can effect the cure of a fever or a diarrh[unknown]a is a mystery to all but themselves. Then they “bark at the sickness,” in other words, call upon it to be off to the ends of the earth, and to return to the regions of the unseen world: they invoke the aid of spirits, and of ancient worthies and unworthies down to their own immediate ancestors, and spin the invocations out to a sufficient length to bring them to the daylight hours. Here the grand climax is reached--the truant soul has to be caught. If the patient is apparently in a dangerous state, they pretend the soul has escaped far away, perhaps to the river; and they will wave about a garment, or a piece of woven cloth, to imitate the action of throwing a cast net to inclose it as a fish is caught; perhaps they give out that it has escaped into the jungle, and they will rush out of the house to circumvent and secure it there; perhaps they will say it has been carried away over seas to unknown lands, and will all set to and play at paddling a boat to follow it. But more generally the operation is made a more simple one. The Manangs rush round the “Pagar Api” as hard as they can, singing a not unpleasing chant, until one of them falls on the floor and remains motionless; the others sit down. The bystanders cover the motionless Manang with a blanket, and wait whilst his spirit is supposed to hie away to Hades, or wherever the erring soul has been carried, and to bring it back. Presently he revives, looks vacantly about like a man just waking out of sleep, then he rises with his right hand clenched as if holding something. That hand contains the soul; and the Manang proceeds to the patient, and returns it to the body through the crown of the head, muttering at the same time a few words of incantation. This “nangkap semengat,” “catching the soul,” is the great end, to which all that has preceded is only preliminary, and which only a fully equipped Manang is competent to perform. As the devouring demon is supposed to be driven away by the magical arts and charms of the Manang, so the soul is allured into submission to him by his persuasive invitations and melodious cadences. And as he approaches the point of accomplishing this grand feat of spiritual power, he signs thus:--",1,1,0,1,0,0
Ritual318,Mandi Rumah,"The Dyak Feast Called ""Mandi Rumah""

When a new house has been taken possession of by it's future inmates, certain ceremonies must be gone through to make it habitable, such as the rite making it lawful for the house to receive food for it's inhabitants. But the rite of mandi rumah (house washing) may be deferred, although the house must be under certain restrictions until it has been performed.

Mandi rumah literally translated is ‘to bathe the house.’ Yet the term is more common than the more exact phrase masu rumah ‘to wash the house.’ Muai rumah (lit. to abolish the house) is also used as the name of this feast, having reference to the abolishing of restrictions by it's observance.

It is hard to say what was the original significance of this observance, for nothing but the name implies anything about washing, the ceremony as now performed having nothing to suggest it. Perhaps, however, there is a hint of the original idea remaining in the restriction that prevents anyone polluting the water of the bathing and watering place, by fishing with the aid of tuba (poisonous roots) which is thrown into the water to stupify the fish or kill them, before the masu rumah .

Again, if, as the name implies, a cleansing of the house is meant it is difficult to divine it's purpose. The washing of an old house might signify the purging of some stain of guilt attaching to it or it's inmates, but in the case of a new house it seems to imply a sort of consecration to good purposes, and the formal renunciation of all that is accounted by Dyak custom immoral.

It's actual present significance to the Dyak does not seem to go beyond the observance of a custom made binding by tradition, and made desirable enough by the irksomeness of restrictions that tradition also enjoins until the mandi rumah has been duly observed. And these restrictions are irksome enough.

The Dyaks, having no separate buildmgs for courts of justice, workshops, factories or the like, transact all business and perform all indoor labour within the house they live in, where the ruai or broad covered verandah affords ample space. But until the mandi rumah , no court may be held in it by the chief for the settlement of disputes; fines, if imposed, may not be paid; wearing and the making of blankets from bark (tekalong) are prohibited. Any person violating any of these rules must incur a penalty, which takes the form of a sacrifice, to avert the misfortune resulting from such offence which would fall upon the inmates. This condition of things prevails until the mandi rumah .

Now to consider the feast itself, to which the Dyaks commonly add other ceremonies to save the expense that separate observance would entail.

It is generally held after a good harvest, preparation having been in hand for two or three months. When the time draws near “a promise of three days” (to borrow Dyak phraseology) is made.

The first day is devoted to beban tangga (making the ladder for the house). The second day is occupied in the cooking of piring, i. e. offerings that are to be made to the gods at the feast. Invitations are sent out, fighting cocks are set, and on the third day the feast commences. Three rites properly belong to the feast, namely; (1) beban tangga, ‘the making of the ladder,’ (2) mangkong tiang , ‘striking the post,’ and (3) ngiga igi engkuni ‘seeking the seed of the engkuni tree,’ which is used as a charm.

Now to consider these rites in detail.

When all the guests, who include all the men of importance in the neighbourhood, arrive they are received with great ceremony and a pig is sacrificed for them, or a libation made of their home-made toddy. This is by way of an offering to their patron saints or gods. The opening ceremony is miring ka tangga , (the offering to the ladder). As soon as the new ladder is placed in position, Pulang Gana and other gods are propitiated by an offering, which is hung underneath the ladder, and the sacrifice of a pig. An old man then recites as follows: --

“But thou art the heart of iron wood,
“Let the Malays, the Chinese, the Europeans
“Come up, and bring with them brass-ware,
“As gongs, tetawak and bebendai ,
“Let their merchandise be cheap, etc.”

The second ceremony is mangkong tiang . The same old man enters the room of the chief of the house first to perform the rite. Another offering is prepared in the room, and is placed on the shelf of the kitchen for Pulang Gana, the god of the earth.

The old chanter then strikes a post of the house with a bamboo containing pulut (rice ready cooked) meanwhile reciting this incantation: --

“Thou art not a common bamboo,
“Thou art the beart of iron wood,
“Be thou a supporter to fill the paddy bin
“And cause the Malays, the Chinese, the Europeans,
“To come and buy paddy, and help us O Pulang Gaua.

The chanter must repeat the ceremony in every room, and if the house be a long one, a great part of the day will have slipped by ere the drowsy old man, now an object of mirth and laughter, has finished his task.

In the ruai or reception room of the house the professional reciters are deeply engaged with their incantation called pengap to look for igi engkuni . It is a long recitation (and is done at the top of their voices) to implore the father of Nendak to descend from above and give them the igi engkuni. Apai. or the father of Nendak, when he comes down puts the igi engkuni in the engkuni post and it is taken from there. The incantation begins from fonr in the afternoon and goes on till daylight the next day.

The feast lasts a day and a Dight and the house or village is generally quite full. The confusion and the noise are so great that it requires a good writer to describe it. At the approach of day light much stir is made, when Apai Nendak, Pulang Gana , and the rest of the gods are supposed to arrive at the feast. Offerings are made to them and the musical instrnments are struck louder and with more vigour. Shouting and laughter, the crowing of cocks and dogs fighting all about the place are enough to drive any one mad. Such is this religious feast of the Dyaks.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual319,Nyabak Nerengka,"Dyak Burial Custom

It is necessary first of all to explain what a baya is. Baya are things given to a deceased person. These things are either buried with the deceased or placed on the grave. The baya consists of things which belong to the deceased and things which are given by friends.

Whilst a person is about to breathe his last the baya is immediately put aside for him. Friends and relations who come to see him contribute to it. But as soon as life is extinct it becomes tabooed for any one living to contribute to it.

At the moment life is extinct the mouth and eyes are closed by some near relation, the wife or his own child. The corpse is washed and clothed and raw rice is sprinkled on the chest. He is then taken out to the covered verandah of the house (ruai) with the mat on which he died, and carefully walled round with home made blankets (pua kumbu) or mats. All the women enter the enclosure and surround the corpse. and wail at the top of their voices. The baya is taken out of the room and is put on the passage of the house, with a little hearth and light on it, raw rice, and a live fowl. If the coffin is to be taken up to the house two live fowls are required for propitiation.

The lamentation of the women whilst watching the corpse is by no means deficient in poetry. It is exceedingly striking and most heartrending to listen to it. Every one recalls the loss she once suffered, and entreats the dead and the spirits etc. to take her too. It runs thus: -- “Adopt me spirit and take me to the cemetery at the river called Pedalai . Lift me up, whirlwind, to the highest parts of heaven.” And various other sayings which would fill a volume.

For a few hours only the corpse is allowed to be in the house, unless the death has taken place at night when a longer time is permitted. With the Dyaks immediately a person is dead he must be separated from the living. A deceased person is called a spirit (antu) , and is dangerous to the living.

It is then taken to the cemetery with the baya , a live fowl, raw rice, and a cooking pot. At the edge of the cemetery some halt with the fowl, fire, raw rice, and the cooking pot. The rest quickly proceed into the cemetery bearing the corpse and the baya . Those who halt at the edge of the cemetery cook the rice and kill the fowl for their consumption. The blood of the fowl is put in a bamboo for the purpose of propitiation.

With other tribes the corpse and all halt at the edge of the cemetery. After everybody has eaten and has touched the toe of his foot, they proceed into the cemetery to bury the dead.

On the ground where the grave is to be dug some raw rice has to be sprinkled. If there be no coffin some make it and others dig the grave.

The interring of the dead is executed with great haste for fear of a bad omen. Much care is taken that no green leaves go into the grave for fear the deceased should thereby be offended and haunt them. On the return home all of them cut, out of the branches of trees, hooks and place them on their shoulders. This signifies that the hooks keep the soul back from wandering about in Hades. As soon as the halting place is reached at the edge of the cemetery the propitiation of touching the toes with the blood of the fowl begins. All partake of the rice and fowl. The last man drives a plece of wood into the ground at the edge of the cemetery and every body throws away his wooden hook.

The driving of a piece of wood at the edge of the cemetery, by the last man, signifies a barrier put between the living and the dead, and between Hades and this world. The raw rice, first sprinkled on the ground where the grave is to be dug, is to compensate the earth, or rather I should say Pulang Gana the god of the earth.

No portion of the soil of the cemetery is allowed to enter their house. Every body washes himself clean before he enters the house. If the soil is brought to the house plagues will be the result.

The bereaved persons confine themselves to their room for three days in order to undergo their adat or custom called bepana . The rite of bepana is mourning including a mild kind of fasting. During this time the fire in the room is kept lighted, and at every meal time, when scanty food is served, a part is thrown under the house as a share for the deceased. After the third day of bepana has expired the relatives beserara bangkit , which means perform the rite of entirely separating themselves from the deceased. It involves the putting out of the fire, the mourners are fed by a friend, and a medicine man (manang) waves a fowl over their heads, simultaneously reciting a poetic prayer to the effect that their souls may continue to live. The fowl that is waved becomes a propitiatory sacrifice on behalf of the mourners.

The three days of bepana are stringently observed. All the inmates of the house rest from their daily pursuits. The usual mirth and jollity is hushed and sadness alone reigns throughout the house. To the memory of the deceased something is held sacred. either an article of jewellery or a fruit tree of some sort; but it must be the property of the deceased. The length of time this property is considered sacred depends upon whether the relatives have consummated the feast for the dead, called berantu . Until this feast is passed the property is still held sacred.

With the Saribas Dyaks the blood of the fowl that is killed at the halting place at the cemetery is brought home and is placed at the ladder on the ground. All the women that wail for the deceased go down and touch their toes with the blood for a propitiation.

Each tribe has it's own peculiarity. Amoug the Undup, Balau, and Batang Ai a professional wailer has first to be sought for or rather engaged. When a person dies a professional wailer is engaged either immediately or two or three days after the death occurs. This is called the rite of nyabak nerengka , which means lamenting the deceased in order that he may travel direct to Hades. It appears that, with the Dyaks, unless the ceremony of nyabak nerengka is performed the soul of the dead wanders about in the unseen world and will never reach Hades.

The professional wailer is generally a gifted person, skilled in poetry, and is supposed to possess an intimate knowledge of all that befalls the dead on their journey to Hades through the unseen regions. He avers that the soul has to pass seven places of the utmost importance before it reaches it's destination. Therefore unless the sabak nerengka is properly performed the soul will never reach Hades and will encounter the greatest danger. He avers also that while giving the sould assistance he is himself treading on dangerous soil, and therefore demands a large fee for steering the soul of the departed into it's haven of everlasting bliss.

The proceeding in nyabak nerengka is considered to be a complete sacrifice to the powers reigning in Hades. The wailer sits on a swing in the room of the deceased, and her opening words are couched in the choicest poetry which charms and fascinates her hearers who delight in such fictions. She commences by severely blaming all the materials of the building for not holding back the soul of the deceased. This undoubtedly points to the fact that the Dyaks regard such inanimate objects as gods. She then traces the journey of the soul in it's six perilous positions. Firstly, towards the country of the Tigers; secondly, towards the Kayu malam ; thirdly, towards the abode of the bird Dundun ; fourthly, towards the haunt of the bird Undan ; fifthly, towards the country of the Great Wind; and sixthly, towards Hades, and when it arrives it throws itself down as one who has endured great fatigue. As the soul is in that unconscious state through the fatigue of it's incessant journey Dara Rambai Geruda Salabong Kanggam brings it refreshment and through her magic revives it, and enables it to partake of it with a good appetite.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual320,Ngambi Sabayan Ngabang,"Dyak Custom called ""Berantu""

“Ngambi Sabayan ngabang”, or to invite the Spirits at Hades to the feast, expresses the object of the feast called “Berantu.”

The deceased according to Dyak belief, after the Sabak nerengka , is safely lodged at Hades, and enjoys happiness, ease and luxuries. The fertility of the soil of Hades, it seems, is beyond comparison, and the deceased only requires a few inches of land to farm on. The rivers there abound in fish, and the woods are full of game that is good for food.

On the occasion of the “Berantu” a professional wailer is engaged to perform a lengthy recitation in the nature of an invocation to the powers of the unseen world, and to make a complete offering to them. The invocation is called Sabak bebuah , which signifies a recitation poetical as well as historical with regard to the unseen world. Hades, according to the Dyak point of view, is another world similar to this in every respect, except that labour is less and more happiness is enjoyed.

The feast to the dead lasts a day and a night. In the morning the wailer begins the recitation which is called “ Sabak bebuah ” in the room of the bereaved persons. Whilst the women are attentively listening to the fascinating poetry of the wailer, which composition is sometimes heart-rending and sometimes soothing, the men are busily engaged in setting cocks to fight. Weeping, laughing, and shouting to such an extent, they create so great an uproar that it is almost too terrible to be a listener for any length of time.

As soon as night falls, the wailer's swing is removed to the covered verandah of the house (ruai) , where continues the poetical recitation till the dawn of day. The sacrifice and the present (ma) to the deceased are also taken out to the ruai for exhibition and are hung on the wall of the passage or common thoroughfare of the house.

Everybody is seated and order is kept for the space of about half an hour, in order that proper respect may be paid to the ceremony of muka ulit , or the unloosening of the mourning tie. A gong is struck at the head of a procession which is then formed to announce the freedom of the mourners from their sacred tie by those who have recently returned from a war expedition. The mourning robes are touched with the sharp blades of the warrior's sword and cast aside, and the mourners are at once girt with their best apparel. Whilst this is going on war cries are shouted and deafening music from brass instruments creates an infernal din. A fowl is waved over the mourners' heads and killed, and the blood is smeared on their persons. Then and not until then is the sacred tie of mourning pronounced loosened.

The wailer professes first of all in vision by means of the sacred poetical recitation to travel along an exceedingly high mountain. After the mountain is ascended the road leads down to a deep valley, and after that is crossed it brings the wailer direct to the house of Sang Juara, a married man. The wailer, by means of enchantments, inveigles Sang Juara into fighting a main. The wailer wins of course, and takes Sang Juara's wife as the forfeit. Sang Juara's wife escorts the wailer to the house of Ribut the Wind. Ribut is asked to take the message of invitation to the people at Hades. It appears that the wailer only dare go as far as the house of Ribut. The wife of Sang Juara is returned to her husband and the wailer returns home.

Ribut, it seems, delivers the message to the people at Hades by boisterously blowing there, until everybody is put into utter consternation. In conquence, Sabayan begau, i. e. the inhabitants of Hades are put into a state of alarm. They look up and see the living making a feast. The sacrifice that is offered directs their attention at once to the feast that is meant for them.

The next morning after the feast the offertory sacrifice is taken to the cemetery and is placed on the grave of the deceased.

The present to the deceased differs in every tribe. In fact in some tribes, in addition to the present, monuments ( sungkup > ) of hard wood are taken and placed over the graves of the deceased. These monuments are handsomely carved and painted. It is worth one's while to go to a certain cemetery in the Saribas to see the different tombs so beautifully carved and painted with their own designs.

The present is supposed to represent the different articles a man or a woman uses in daily life, and is also supposed to furnish the dead with implements in Hades ( Sabayan ) so as to enable them to earn their living there.

It seems nobody knows the road that leads to the house of Ribut but Sang Juara and his wife. The road to Ribut's house is not only beset by dangers of various kinds but is intersected by many complicated junctions. It lies through a country adjacent to Hades.

Ribut, or correctly speaking Antu Ribut, the Spirit Wind, through courtesy is obliged to carry the message to Hades. From Antu Ribut's house to Hades it seems to be quite impossible for any mortal to traverse. Antu Ribut delivers the message by blowing boisterously at Hades and putting everybody into a state of alarm. Being in such a state the people of Hades have to gather all their wits about them to find out the cause of such a visit from Antu Ribut. Their pinang trees, etc: are blown down and the roofings of their houses are displaced. Finally the cause is ascertained--that the living make a feast and invite the dead to come to it. Antu Ribut ceases to blow and the dead get ready to go to the feast. Everybody puts on their jewellery and falls into a procession. It seems that pari of the journey has to be made by water and part by land. Everyone is not only gay but is delighted to accept the invitation from the living; to see those whom they knew a few days, a few months or a few years ago. They delight at the advantage they have over them. They can go to the feast of the living but the living cannot come to their's.

There was once related a most wonderful story about a woman called Selaka. It was upon the occasion of a berantu feast being held, and she was working hard at her farm when there passed her a procession of men, women, and children who shouted out her name to her. She answered and turned round and recognized several among them who died several years ago. There were two who died only recently. “Come,” said the dead, “go with us to the feast of so-and-so.” She was fascinated and accompanied them to the feast. On the way she was made a wailer and from that very hour she was able to recite the wailed incantation. According to her version of the story the dead were better dressed than the living and were gay and happy. This seems to corroborate the Dyaks' general idea of Hades and the departed.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ritual322,"Nyinklan Benih, The Ceremony of Touching the Paddi Seeds with Blood","""Nyinklan Benih"", or The Ceremony of Touching the Paddi Seeds with Blood

To avoid incurring the displeasure of the gods and especially Pulang Gana it is considered necessary by Dyaks, in compliance with the traditions of their forefathers, that, previous to clearing the jungle for their paddy farms, Pulang Gana must first be approached with an offering. To render the seeds acceptable and to ask his blessing upon them, the blood of a sacrificed pig must be smeared on them.

After the farm is burnt, previous to sowing the seed, a council is convened to discuss the feast that is to be given. Friends from far and near are invited to celebrate the occasion.

The chief of the house or viliage, owing to his rank, occupies a prominent place on this occasion. His covered verandah ( ruai ) is decorated, a basket ( sintong ) is placed in the centre and in it an offering to Pulang Gana and Ini Andan is placed. Everybody in the village or house puts a handful of his seed into the sintong , and with it his paddy charms wrapped up in pieces of old cloth. The sintong is carefully covered with home-made blankets ( pua ).

After dinner an able man is asked to intone a fable in the choicest words of their poetry to invoke the presence of Pulang Gana and Ini Andan at the feast which is given in their honour. The intoner also sings praises to the seed and personifes them. The whole night is spent in listening to the intoner. Before he introduces his mythological poetry a pig is first killed, and it's blood is smeared on the sintong in which the offering, seed and charms are put. The intoner performs his duties for a consideration.

At dawn the sintong is taken to the farm and is placed on a raised platform ( plasar ). An offering with flags is suspended on the platform and the mythologist begins the preliminary sowing round the platform so as to surround the sintong by making about thirty or forty holes, then his duty is completed. The seed cannot be touched by anybody before he has performed the preliminary sowing.

The general sowing then begins, but at the outset is only done twice up and down the farm, then the people rest for refreshments. After the refreshments the sowing is resumed even in spite of ill omens. It is only prohibited that the sowing should be prolonged till dusk for fear of the ensiring omen (a species of grasshopper).

If the ensiring omen is heard during sowing every body makes for a billian trunk or any piece of billian for refuge. If there be no billian of any description in the farm all the women make for the men's dibbles and cling there for refuge. Everybody remains still in the position he or she is in until relieved by a sacrificed pig which dies a victim for all.

The ensiring omen is deemed by Dyaks as portent. It prognosticates the terrible event of the speedy approach of the King of Terror. Sometimes they take refuge for hours before they dare move. They have to wait patiently for a passer-by to send their message home for a pig. The pig is killed, the blood is smeared on the forehead of everybody, then all are relieved or rather saved from impending death.

As soon as everybody is relieved by the saerificed pig, the sowing is resumed. After the sowing has been going on for some little time, the ensiring omen is no longer portent.

Before everybody has arrived at the farm all bad omens are considered portent, but after their arrival at the farm no omens need be attended to. When it is portent the sowing is to be postponed for that day. The bad omens that are considered portent before the arrival of everybody at the farm are called the omens kekepak , and the bad omens that are not deemed portent after the arrival of everybody at the farm are called the omen truni .",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual323,Bathing Ceremony,"Meri Anak Mandi (Bathing Ceremony)

Shortly after the child has been named, its parents will discuss the day for its bathing ceremony in the river. The reason for holding this ceremony, is that if the child is not bathed in the river with offerings made to the deities and spirits, it must not be taken by anyone to bathe in any river, since it will not be protected by Sera Gindi and the spirits of fish, turtles and other aquatic creatures from the dangers present in the water.

Early during the night prior to the bathing ceremony, the child's parents will call for all of the people in the longhouse to meet them at their ruai , in order to inform them that they will hold a bathing ceremony for their child at the river on the morrow. They ask everyone in the house to stay away from work in order to attend this ceremony.

Next morning, when the day is still cool, an elderly man of a well-to-do, long respected family leads the procession with a flag. Behind him walks another aristocrat who brings a cock. After them walk a woman who carries the child in a beautifully woven blanket. Behind her another woman carries and sprinkles the letup (popped rice) along the road to the river. Behind her are the young men who perform gendang music.

As the procession reaches the pengkalan , the man who carries the flag cuts the water with the following prayers:

We call for you king of tortoises and you supernatural
king of the turtles,
Where are you king of the adong fish and you king of
the kulong fish,
Where are you crocodile king and you king of the
gumba tortoises.
We beg all of you to float him if he goes down in a
sinking ship,
We beg you to lift him up if he falls into the sea.
If he goes on a long journey,
We beg you to make him safe along the way,
So that he may return in good health to his home.

After this prayer is ended a man who carries the cock kills it above the place where the child is to have his bath. As the cock's blood drips into the river, a woman baths the child in the river where the blood is drifting. Another woman throws coins and beads into the river.

As soon as the child is dipped into the river, one of the bystanders fires his shotgun in the air to deafen them from hearing any omen and at the same time the musicians beat their gongs and drums.

After the child has been bathed, the cock's wings are severed and hung from a barbed spear ( berayang ) thrust blade upward on the river bank, and the basket of offerings is hung from a bamboo. 

After the ceremony is over, the procession returns to the house with music of gongs and drums. Upon their arrival, the child is handed to his mother who brings him to sit on a tawak gong covered with a woven blanket. While they sit there, they are sprinkled over their foreheads with the water from a bowl in which gold and silver has been placed as well as water of the batu penabar burong stone charms which can neutralize omens. After this is done, the family serves tuak wine, soft drinks and buns to their friends and relatives who are present. At noon, a midday meal is served on the family's lower gallery.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual323,Nganjong Mandi,"The ceremony of first taking a child to bathe is called by the Dyaks nganjong mandi which means to take to bathe. The mother calls a maiden and asks her to catch a fowl. The husband or anybody waves the fowl over the child and then kills it. The maiden who is asked to catch the fowl is honoured by being asked to carry the child to the bathing-place. After the fowl is killed, a wing is deposited in an areea spathe with some ashes. The maiden carries the child in a gaudy home-made blanket, wears a gaudy sun-hat, holds in one hand ignited lukai , which is the bark of the lukai tree. She marches down to the bathing-place gracefully, and the mother follows with a little boy armed with a spear and the spathe of the areca, containing the ashes and the wing of the fowl. When the bathing-place is reached, the wing of the fowl with the ashes in the spathe of the areea, is pierced with the spear and placed standing alongside the bathing place. The maiden then walks gently down into the water to give the child its ablutions, or rather to introduce the child to the general bathing-place. They return to the house and the spear is left behind. When the house is reached, beads are threaded and tied round the legs, to act as eyes to prevent the child from slipping. Beads are also tied round the hands in order not to make a miss when throwing a spear. The lips of the child are slightly besmeared with bugs in order that when it chews the lips might appear red. It is made to suck the tail of a Kli fish to prevent it from having thrush too soon. Sparrows' eggs are dashed on its head to enable it to endure the rain when its mother takes it to the farm.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Ritual324,Timang Gawai Amat,"Timang Gawai Amat

Sather has described the chants accompanying Iban headhunting rituals as being “rich in religious and historical allusion, symbolic metaphor, expressions of social values and shared assumptions regarding the relationship of man, nature and the spiritual world” (1977a:ix). We shall argue that it is through the text of the timang gawai amat , and its enactment in Iban ritual, that the significance of Iban headhunting is properly revealed.    

The ritual action at Iban gawai , or festivals, is based upon an oral narrative, or timang ( pengap outside the Ulu Ai and Ulu Rejang). Timang are performed by professional bards, or lemambang , assisted by a two-or three-man chorus ( orang nyagu ). All timang gawai amat follow the same general pattern, or “path” ( jalai ), but their length varies according to the grade of festival being celebrated (see above). Each level takes the timang invocation a stage further in the narrative, with the highest grade of festival completing the cycle.

The main body of the timang gawai amat , that is to say the part which is always performed at every gawai amat , can be broken up into a number of key episodes, or narrative sequences. These are as follows: the opening sequence, in which Lang Sengalang Burong's absence is noticed; the sending of an invitation to the house of Lang ( ngambi' ngabang ); the headhunting expedition of the gods ( ngerampas ); Lang's journey to the longhouse of men; and the ceremonial welcome of Lang on his arrival there ( mansang ngabang ) (Masing 1989:61-62).

The most important of these episodes - at least in as far as appreciating the ritual significance of Iban headhunting is concerned - is the one in which the gods themselves are described as setting out on an headhunting raid. The attack is directed against a powerful and malevolent demon, or antu , known variously as Nising, Bengkong or Beduru. The war-party is made up of the sons-in-law of Lang ( menantu Lang), who are, of course, the omen-birds of Iban augury. They must take to the war-path in order to satisfy the demands of Endu Dara Ticin Temaga - the youngest daughter of Lang - who refuses to go to the festival without having something to bring as a gift for their hosts. The gift she has in mind is nothing other than a freshly taken head:

Enti isang lama enggai kitai dia aku enggai mai ,
Ke bereba di pala tiang ,
Enti rangkah pala aku enggai mai ,
Enggai enda mai ka baru agi ciang .

I do not want to bring with me old isang leaves, Which uselessly crowd the top of the post, I do not want to bring the ancient skull, I must bring a new one which is still dripping with blood (Sandin 1977:69, 71).

This ultimatum dispatches the omen-birds on a journey to the ends of the earth. As they pass through different regions of a largely mythical universe, they enquire from those they meet if they have seen “the precious seed of the ranyai ”. Time and again the answer is “No”, but eventually they encounter the spirit Rintong Langit Pengulor Bulan, who tells them that he has heard it “crying” ( nyabak ) in the house of Nising.

At this point there is a sudden change in the imagery of the timang . Up until this moment, trophy heads have consistently been represented as “fruit” ( buah ) or “seed” ( igi ) of one description or another. Here, however, they are portrayed as the “children” ( anak ) of Nising.

Nising is in fact an antu gerasi : a frightful ogre, with eyes as big as cups and ears as large as winnowing baskets. His breath is described as roaring like a blacksmith's hearth, while his teeth grind like the hammering of steel at an anvil (Sandin 1977:108, 111). His territory is situated at “the edge of the yellow and red sky” ( tisi langit kuning, tisi langit radu ) - i.e. on the horizon where the sun sets (and rises). In this respect, Nising is located, like so many real life enemies, at the very limits of the known world.

The omen-birds, having located their prize, decide to make a reconnaissance of the enemy longhouse. Hiding beneath its floor, they hear the “children” of Nising whimpering and crying out in their sleep. Their distress is caused by terrifying nightmares in which they have dreamt they were bitten through by snakes, or else carried off by crocodiles. This, their mother tells them, does not bode well, for they have seen their own deaths at the hands of enemies.

That night, the omen-birds themselves are visited by strange dreams in which they see themselves cutting down great bunches of coconuts, or else being greeted by beautiful maidens with flowers in their hair. According to Lang, these images foretell their success in taking heads on the morrow.

The next day, the omen-birds stealthily enter the longhouse of Nising to take him unawares, so that he has no opportunity to resist them. They then proceed to flatter him with extravagant compliments and false praises. At the same time they ply him with vast quantities of palm wine ( arak ), which Nising gulps down with a great roaring noise, like the sound of a forest fire. In the end he collapses to the floor in a drunken stupor; whereupon the omen-birds leap forward to gather up their prize - the fabulous seed of the ranyai palm.    

As this point in the timang narrative is reached, those men who are sponsoring the festival cut down the coconuts that are attached to the ranyai shrine. They have previously dressed themselves as for the war-path, with fine jackets of woven cloth and coats of bearskin, or leopard cat. On their heads they wear plaited war bonnets adorned with hornbill feathers, and at their sides they carry swords ornamented with the hair of slain enemies. It is with the latter that they cut away the igi' ranyai , or “seed of the shrine”, uttering as they do so, the war-cry that traditionally accompanied the return of a successful headhunting party. The entire sequence is, of course, a ritual re-enactment of beheading the enemy.

The timang narrative then goes on to describe the return of the omenbirds to the longhouse of Lang where they are welcomed by the women of the community. The newly taken heads are themselves ceremonially received by the wife of Lang - Indai Kecendai - who wraps them in the very best of her pua kumbu' blankets. With the demands of Ticin Temaga thus fulfilled, Lang and his household are then able to proceed to the festival.

All timang gawai amat reach this point in the cycle. That is to say, they all describe the headhunting expedition of the omen-birds, and the journey of Lang and his entourage to the festival of men. This takes one night, and the timang closes at dawn with the ceremonial welcome of Lang by the longhouse community. Subsequent stages in the narrative depend upon the type of festival being held: each ascending level taking the timang one step further towards completion.

The next episode in the timang cycle, after the arrival of Lang, is among the most dramatic in the narrative, for it describes the rite of ngelampang and the splitting open of the trophy head to release its seed (see above). It begins with Lang getting up to perform the dance of Iban warriors ( berayah ). This imitates the soaring flight of the Brahminy Kite (which is of course Lang's own avian manifestation). Lang has previously been well supplied with rice wine ( tuak ), and so he is a little intoxicated by now. As he dances, Lang lets fall, from the basket on his back, the head trophy that he has brought. The women are appalled by the horrible spectacle and complain that it is not the splendid thing talked about by their husbands - that “most precious ornament” about which they have heard so much - but something ugly and disgusting. On hearing these words, the head trophy bursts into tears and begins to wail, just like a small child or infant.

Various female deities are then summoned to “nurse” ( ngua ) the unhappy head, among them the wives of the legendary headhunting heroes of Panggau Libau. But even the best attempts of Kumang, Lulong, and the others are to no avail - the trophy head is inconsolable. In the end, in desperation, it is passed to the highest ranking shamans in the community - the manang bali' . The latter are individuals who have changed their sex from male to female in the pursuit of their vocation ( bali' lit. = “changed”), their adopted status being reflected in their female attire. The position of manang bali' in society is a very special one in that they are able to slay malevolent demons ( antu ) in ritual combat. In this respect their role is comparable to that of Iban warriors, except that their deeds are performed in the supernatural realm against unseen foe, rather than on the ground against enemies of flesh and blood.    

Upon being handed to the manang bali' , the trophy head immediately ceases its crying and begins to laugh instead. Its humor, it seems, arises from “the droll appearance of the transvestite shamans, with their female attire all awry, their unformed breasts, and their broken and dangling penises” (Freeman 1979:241). Having successfully stopped its tears, the manang bali' announce that the reason for the trophy head's unhappiness is because “it has yet to find its beloved mother, ... it has yet to greet its father” (Masing 1981:323, 323b). At this point it is passed to the wife of the festival sponsor, who assumes the role of “mother” to the head (Masing 1981:323 n.). The manang bali' then announce that what the head would really like is to be planted ( nanam ) - “to be thrust into the earth like the sucker of a banana plant, or a taro shoot” (Freeman 1979:242).

Lang agrees to this, but only on condition that the head first be split in two ( ngelampang ). He then forges a brand new sword for this purpose, carefully tempering the steel and honing its blade. With this in hand he slices through the trophy head with a single stroke to release its content of seed and sacred rice ( padi pun ). And as the words of the timang describe this scene, it is simultaneously enacted by aspiring headhunters on the verandah ( tanju' ) of the longhouse. In this instance, however, the trophy head is substituted by a coconut, which had previously adorned the ranyai shrine. The rite of ngelampang is explicitly identified with the act of decapitating the enemy ( pumpong ), and Freeman comments that “the success of the aspirant in performing this rite is taken as a measure of his future prowess as a headhunter” (1979:243).

A crucial feature of the rite of ngelampang is the idea that the trophy head, when split open, contains seed - most importantly that of the sacred rice, or padi pun . This seed, Lang says, must be planted. At this point the timang invocation enters into a remarkable allegory in which warfare and headhunting are portrayed through images of rice farming.

The main stages in the allegory are as follows: the forging of farming implements / the forging of weapons; the search for new farm lands / reconnoitring enemy territory; seeking propitious omens for farming / seeking propitious omens for going on the war-path; felling the forest for swiddens / hacking at the posts of the enemy longhouse; firing the swiddens / putting the enemy longhouse to the torch; sowing the rice seed / planting the eyeballs of the enemy; reaping the rice crop / beheading the enemy; storing away the harvest / receiving new head trophies.

In this light, Iban warfare is explicitly identified with the circumstances of rice farming. In particular, a symbolic parallel is drawn between the taking of heads and the reaping of rice. Freeman, in describing this episode in the timang invocation, writes: “It was the faith of the pagan Iban that by this prefiguration in symbolic form they would be certain to succeed in capturing further heads in minutely planned raids into alien territory, so ensuring the fertility of the padi they aspired eventually to plant there” (1979:244).

The final stages of the timang cycle have to do with the cultivation of cotton plants and the weaving of war-jackets for the festival sponsors. The Iban have traditionally grown their own cotton ( taya ), which they plant in subsidiary swiddens some time after the rice crop has been harvested. The cotton is used in the weaving of pua' textiles which play an important role in Iban ritual life and are particularly associated with the cult of headhunting (see below). As with the earlier agricultural allegory, the cultivation and harvesting of the cotton fields is identified with warfare and the taking of heads (Masing 1981:430, & n.). In particular, Lang cautions that if the cotton pods be broken, then the pieces should be placed in a gourd ( genok ) and covered with a hat made from plaited lily fiber ( uyok ketapu senggang ). This is precisely what is done if a trophy head has been accidently broken into pieces (Masing 1981:430, & n.). Once the cotton has been harvested, and the pods dried in the sun (this is allegorical of the smoking of trophy heads), it is spun into thread ( ubong ). This is then woven into war-jackets, or baju , which are to be worn by those men who are sponsoring the festival (Masing 1981:431-38). The ogresses Samambai and Panggit are summoned to perform this task, and as this point in the timang is reached, the festival sponsors themselves put on their woven war-jackets and again dress as if for a headhunting raid. This time they descend from the longhouse to slash at a head trophy mounted on a pole in front of the building. The head is then brought back to the longhouse and presented to their wives who are seated at the foot of the ranyai shrine (Masing 1981:441-42). And as in earlier instances, this sequence is explicitly identified with beheading the enemy.

The harvesting of the cotton fields and the weaving of war-jackets is reached on the seventh night of the gawai amat invocation and marks the end of the timang cycle. At this point, the gods “bless” ( nenjang ) their hosts and present them with magical charms ( pengaroh ). They then depart for their longhouse in the skies. And with the completion of the timang , so ends the gawai amat .

Only the highest ranking festivals in the gawai amat cycle see the timang performed all the way through. Lower level gawai pause at some earlier stage in the narriative - for example at the point describing the forging of farm implements, or when Lang sets out in search of land for his swiddens. To have completed the cycle is the greatest achievement that an individual can aspire to within the traditional Iban prestige system. The only option left is to return to the beginning and celebrate the gawai amat cycle for a second time.",0,1,0,0,0,0

Ritual326,The Rites of Manggol,"The Rites of Manggol

As soon as the kayu burong have been distributed, the Iban are free to proceed with the rites of manggol , which inaugurate the actual clearing of farm-land. No family, however, begins until it feels that it has the good will or blessing of the spirits--the state called lantang --and spirit approval is normally conveyed in a dream (see above, pp. 118 seq.). If, therefore, the head of the family ( tuai bilek ) or one of the senior members has dreamed during the night that he inspected his fish-trap ( bubu ) and found it full of fish, or climbed a tree with fruit in abundance, or swam across a wide river, taken to symbolize the strength and extent of the rice, this is interpreted as an auspicious dream, and manggol begins. If, however, any member of the family dreamed that he lost his hair, for example, or his teeth fell out, or has had any dream which could be classified as a dream of nakedness ( mimpi telanjai ) or one causing shame or embarrassment ( mimpi malu ), manggol is postponed. Until the family has had an affirmative dream, it is said ‘not yet to be confident and content’ ( bedau lantang ). If one of the bilek members has an unusually positive dream, then he or she is the first to slash the undergrowth ( (dulu mantap babas ).

Once assured that the spirits have approved the undertaking, and, in practice, this normally occurs at the distribution of kayu burong or a day later, the Iban go in family units to their farms to perform the manggol rites. On the way their ears are stopped ( besedal pending ) to avoid hearing other undesirable bird-calls. They take with them their kayu burong and all that is required for sacrifices and offerings. All bilek members participate, even children who cannot contribute actively, since it is thought that the fortune of one is the fortune of all. Both manggol and the rites which initiate harvest are matters for the bilek and must be attended by the man and his wife as well as their children if possible and other bilek members. In 1961, for example, an Iban insisted on his wife leaving hospital in Simanggang in order to take part, since he was convinced that the crop might otherwise be poor.

During manggol a number of pemali or penti restrictions come into force (see above, p. 113). These vary slightly from family to family, but among the most important at the farm are:

(1) mali gali , the prohibition against lying down, for fear the rice will recline on its side and not stand properly;

(2) mali beklambi or bebaju , the prohibition against wearing a coat or a shirt, for fear that the farm will be swathed in weeds;

(3) mali nginti , the prohibition against fishing with a hook, for fear that the rice will not prosper and smell badly ‘like a fish’ ( bau lang );

(4) mali mandi enti bedau datai di rumah , the prohibition against bathing before returning to the longhouse, for fear the farm will not burn well when the time comes to fire it;

(5) mali kemi enggau bira di tanah , a prohibition against urinating or defecating on the ground, feared to cause offence.

On arriving at the farm site ( pangkalan ) the Iban selects a suitable tree. It must be latex- or sap-producing ( kayu begetah ), ideally pudu , or alternatively tekalong, lengkan , or the fruiting arak . With his left hand he scrapes away the weeds and undergrowth from a patch of ground close to the base of the chosen tree. He does this two or three times. Afterwards, in the same way, he does it with his right hand. Although in theory any member of the bilek family can do this, it is most commonly performed by the tuai bilek , who then places the kayu burong on the cleared patch and says a prayer:

Make the soil fertile, make the soil soft,
Make the soil muddy and make the soil rich,
That our rice may grow in profusion,
Not heaped, not halved,
From the foot of the farm to the summit.

The left-side omen-sticks ( Nendak kiba , etc.) are placed in position at the foot of the chosen tree, which is considered especially suitable if it has buttresses ( bandir ). The right-hand omen-sticks ( Nendak kanan ) are fixed into the tree where a cut is made ( silit kayu ) at the height of rice grain when ripe ( tuntun buah padi ). At felling, this tree is left standing. The kayu burong other than Nendak--Embuas, for example--may be set at the limits of the farm: the boundary with the adjoining farm ( entara ), the crest ( punjong ), the foot ( kaki ) and at the side ( rusok ).

After making a first symbolic slash, called mantap pangkalan , with his bush-knife ( duku ), the Iban places his ritual whetstones close to the ground. The whetstones themselves are carefully screened and sheltered ( dipantar ). Were they to be damaged, this would be a sign of serious misfortune, and in no case may they be disturbed by another Iban.

After a piring sacrifice, which comprises the usual ingredients but must be topped by an egg, the Iban performs a biau ceremony. As he waves a fowl, which, in this instance, is specifically required to be female ( manok indu ), he calls on the spirits:

After this he kills the hen and arranges the sacrifice in either two or three piring. One he places at ground level by the foot of the tree where the kayu burong are, a second one by the whetstones ( apa batu ), and for this he constructs a little shelter ( langkau ); the third one is set on a raised support ( tresang dipanggau ) at a height of five to six feet. If there are only two piring, one is placed at ground level and the other on a raised support. Wherever the piring , it is carefully fenced to forestall an ill omen: a snake, for example, passing over it ( mansa ular ) would imply poor yields for at least three years ( tetap tiga taun nadai bulih ).

If, as occasionally occurs, there are no kayu burong to inaugurate, that is to say, the kayu burong of an earlier year are being reused, the earlier omens are thought to remain valid and the season is hoped to follow the pattern of the previous harvest (see above, p. 161). Instead of the kayu burong ceremonial, a gold object ( mas ), which could be a ring ( tinchin ) or a gold tooth-covering ( ngeli mas ), which could be a ring ( tinchin ) or a gold tooth-covering ( ngeli mas ), for example, is offered at the farm base ( pangkalan ) together with a piring sacrifice, a bowl ( mangkok ) and a small jar ( anak benda ). The gold may be recovered after the harvest.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Special rites are also associated with the path which leads from the longhouse to the area chosen for farming. These occur at the beginning of the season when slashing is already under way: Rh. Sa, for example, performed the rites on 14 June in 1961, some three weeks after manggol (see above, Table 30, p. 158).

Augury in the early morning initiates the proceedings and the birds sought are Nendak and, usually, Beragai and/or Embuas. The rites at Rh. Sa were conducted by Lanchai, tuai burong for the season, and on that occasion he heard to his satisfaction seven Nendak on the left and nine on the right, as well as one Beragai call on the right and one Embuas on the left. The kayu burong are taken together with a piring , a pig and a fowl, to the point at which the new farm track leads from an earlier established path. Women beating gongs accompany the procession of longhouse members; as on other occasions, the gongs are intended to prevent further inauspicious omens being heard once the tokens of good omens are already in hand. Gong-beating ceases on arrival at the path intersection, and preparations for the sacrifice begin. The piring are arranged in three portions: one for the Nendak omens heard on the left, one for those heard on the right, and a third for the Embuas call. The seven Nendak calls on the left were, on this occasion, accorded a piring divided into two sets of seven each; the nine on the right received two sets of nine. The piring for Embuas was subdivided into one triple portion. Beragai was thought to be covered by the others and did not receive a separate piring .

The fowl was used to biau and waved over the piring in the usual manner. Then the pig was killed and its liver inspected. An unsatisfactory liver would have been thought to imply a poor harvest, pests or sickness, and had the liver been poor, the tuai burong would have tried a second pig. After examining three livers and finding all inauspicious, the longhouse community might have decided to change the farm site (see above, especially p. 140). On this occasion the liver proved satisfactory, and the carcass of the pig was buried beside the piring as an additional offering before the party returned home, once again to the accompaniment of gong-beating.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual328,Basoh Arang,"When all families in the longhouse have completed the planting of their farms, the rite which terminates the planting prohibitions takes place. This is known as basoh arang . A little burnt wood, charcoal ( arang ), is taken from the farm and mixed with a few grains of rice which have been set aside while planting the padi pun . The tuai burong leads the proceedings, and, as soon as all families have prepared piring sacrifices (which may be anything from three to ninefold), he waves a fowl in the biau ceremony and says:

We are here to wash charcoal
Having completed the planting.
Now may men spear, and may men shoot,
Plait rottan handles, stop up holes,
Kill creeping snakes, and cut down creepers,
Clear and cut bark.
Women may tie and weave kebat....
Death to grass-weeds, growth to rice,
Rice flourish, grass-weeds perish!
May there be plentiful rice for all the longhouse from
one end to the other.

He washes his own hands symbolically in a bowl of water which also contains the charcoal and rice seed. First he throws water against the wall that ‘the rice may be close and thick like the wall’ ( ngambi ka padi rapit baka dinding ), then against the posts of the longhouse that ‘the rice stems may grow to the size of a post’ ( ngambi ka pun padi besai tiang ). While his hands are still wet he should not touch his head lest the rice be small like the individual hairs ( takut ka padi mit rambar baka rambar bok ). After the tuai burong , other members of the longhouse wash their hands in the charcoal water.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual329,"Nunu Lilin, Burning Wax Ceremony","The Ripening Rice

Ritual top-spinning ( mangka padi ) is thought to speed the ripening process. And when the rice begins to ripen ( belaboh murai ) the ceremony of burning wax ( nunu lilin ) normally takes place. After a simple piring has been prepared and an omen-stick ( kayu burong ) has been suspended at the height of ripe ears of rice ( tuntun buah padi ), a small piece of wax is burned on top of the stump of a tree at the farm. This is accompanied by an invocation ( sampi ) and followed by further fivefold piring and a second wax burning.

Now I today am burning wax.
May the dew of those who curse, who work evil
[and bring misfortune]
Be cast away, flung away!
And may the dew of those who harvest rice in plenty,
abundant sweet rice,
[who have success, fame and wealth]
Enter into my rice.

The invocation follows the usual pattern of wishing ill away, summoning the benevolent spirits, and ends with a prayer for a good harvest and health. The rite is concluded with a sevenfold piring . Afterwards the farm is under restrictions ( mali ) for three nights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual330,The Rice Harvest,"The Rie Harvest

When the rice ripens and is nearly ready to harvest, the introductory rites of matah padi take place. The tuai burong and family heads sit on a mat ( tikai ) at a point on the farm track ( jalai umai ) not far from the farms. No one, not even the women back at the longhouse, may bathe ( nadai tau mandi ) lest the feathers of birds be wet ( basah bulu burong )--similar to the restriction when the Iban are seeking auguries for new farm-land (see above, p. 159). Once seated, the tuai burong may not move ( nadai tau nginsit ); if he does, the rice will refuse to be harvested ( padi enggai diketau ). When they have heard seven Nendak calls on the left and seven on the right and the tuai burong has obtained an equivalent number of omen-sticks, a piring is prepared. This is sevenfold, corresponding to the number of calls, and arranged in two portions, according to the sides. Only if the community has decided to celebrate an elaborate festival which includes the timang incantation, are the kayu burong then carried back to the longhouse. Otherwise, they are taken to the farms.

At the farm further piring sacrifices are prepared by the place where the seed baskets were at planting: one on the ground, one on a raised support. The Iban calls first on evil-minded spirits not to interfere or make trouble and declares his intention:

For I am here to gather the ears of rice,
The sacred rice, remun rice, sangking rice, puting rice.

All bilek members are expected to be present, since, like manggol , the harvest concerns the family and the fortune of one is the fortune of all. The senior bilek member sits on the ground with three rice stalks ( tiga pun ) between his legs. Tied to them is a left-side Nendak omen-stick ( Nendak kiba ) and surrounding them a length of thread, dyed red ( ubong mansau ). The red thread also encircles the foot of a raised piring . There is a second piring on the ground. With his fingers the Iban breaks off seven ears of rice immediately to his right. He may not use the reaping instrument ( ketap ) during the matah padi ritual and he must not separate the rice ears from the surrounding leaf lest the rice be embarrassed at its nakedness ( malu telanjai ). The rice is placed with the pulut rice in the piring . Opposite the Iban sits a woman, usually his wife, neither up-river ( ulu ) nor down-river ( ili ), and she plucks seven heads of rice to his left. Both must remain in the same position throughout the rite.

The premature reaping of a little rice follows matah padi . This is called by the special word nyumba . On the first occasion only one basketful ( sasintong ) may be harvested and this, the first of the new rice ( padi baru ), is eaten the same evening. The freshly cooked rice ( asi ) is placed on a Nendak omen-stick; a short prayer often precedes the offering of a little of the rice at the hearth ( dapur ), and a portion is also set aside for the dogs ‘for it is believed that any deleterious influences which may have become associated with the padi... will thus be visited upon the dogs’ (Freeman, 1955a, 62, para. 138). Finally, the family members, in order of seniority, eat the new rice ( asi baru ), and this is invariably an enjoyable, cheerful occasion (as Freeman also remarks, ibid.). The extent of subsequent nyumba depends on two factors: first, whether or not rice stocks from the previous season have been exhausted, and, secondly, the speed with which the new rice ripens fully.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ritual331,Nganjong Ka Penyedai,"The harvest proper is preceded by another ritual called nganjong ka penyedai (literally ‘carry to the mat’), although when the rice ripens early the distinction between matah padi and nganjong ka penyedai is less clear. Penyedai is the name given to a plaited mat which is placed under the carrying baskets ( lanji ) when the rice is being transferred from harvesting-baskets ( sintong ). After the appropriate omens (Nendak, Beragai) have been heard, the ritual begins. Two piring are prepared: one is offered to the spirit of the earth, one is placed in a raised support. At the same time the Iban calls on the prosperous rice spirits to ensure a good harvest:

Spirits of rice, many and in multitude,
Gather and assemble here.
[List of guardian spirits of successful farmers]
Grant that our rice may multiply and increase,
Plentiful in heaps, in piles, in granaries.

Then before spreading out the penyedai mat the Iban shakes it and wishes away undesirable, evil-minded spirits:

Insipid spirits, hungry spirits,
Be off entirely, clear away!

asking that they not interfere with his crop.

Underneath the penyedai are left-side Nendak omen-sticks ( Nendak kiba ) to help ‘pitch up’ ( nyagu ) the rice from below, and, in the support at the side, right-hand Nendak sticks ( Nendak kanan ) to ‘hold the rice on the surface’ ( ngatong ). The penyedai not only serves the practical purpose of catching rice grains which might fall when these are poured from sintong to lanji , but it is also the spirit assembly place for the rice spirits. The rite is designed to encourage the prosperous rice spirits to make this, in particular, their home and not to stray elsewhere. Throughout the harvest, it is thought vital that the samengat padi should have access to and from the penyedai . Reaping must be done in such a way that the samengat can retreat through standing plants to the penyedai , or at least never find itself cut off and stranded in a clearing. A path through the farm must remain as a ‘bridge’ for the samengat padi , and no one is allowed to cross this at critical times.

The initial reaping which follows the introductory rites is often called nangkal (lit., to cut a notch in a tree--as in rubber tapping; or to make a treaty) and should be done by a woman. She approaches with a piring on her sintong and begins by harvesting three stalks which are then bent over and knotted. Three sintong are filled on the first occasion. During nangkal , as on the first day of planting ( nugal ), it is forbidden to ask ( mali ditanya ) what the Iban are doing. The next day no one may work ( sahari diau ) in propitiation for any offence inadvertently caused, and on the first days following, when the harvest proper starts ( ketau ; verb ngetau ), a piring is brought to the farm and offered at the penyedai ; according to Freeman (1955a, 63, para. 141) only cooked rice ( asi ) is presented, but practice evidently varies. On the third day five sintong are filled, on the fourth, seven; after this ngetau is unrestricted.

During ngetau there are various pemali/penti prohibitions: for example, it is a pemali for the basket-string to break ( mali tali sintong putus ) lest the rice refuse to be harvested ( padi enggai diketau ); nor may small ears of rice be left ( enda tau ninggal ka tangkai anak ) lest they cry ( nyabak ) like abandoned children and curse the Iban. Should a barking deer ( kijang ) come into the farmclearing during harvest, it must not be killed; a reaping tool ( ketap ) and basket ( sintong ) are placed before it, because it is believed to have been sent by Pulang Gana to assist, and next day a sacrifice is offered at the trees where it emerged. There are also a number of individual bilek prohibitions: some families are firmly forbidden to bring pigs to the farm (except for augury and sacrifice), others to urinate in a standing position ( kemi bediri ), and so forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual332,Piring,"The piring is an offering composed of rice cooked in bamboos, cakes, eggs, sweet potatoes, plantains, or other fruit, and sometimes small live chickens. If the offering be made in the house these things are put on a brass dish ( tabak ). If the occasion of the sacrifice requires that it be offered elsewhere, a little platform is constructed, consisting of pieces of wood tied together with cane, and fixed on four sticks stuck in the ground. This is the para piring (the altar of sacrifice), and the offering is laid on it. It is covered with a rough roof of palm-leaf, and looks like a miniature native house, and is decorated with white flags. It is the most flimsy thing imaginable, and soon tumbles to pieces. The god or spirit is supposed to come and eat the good things provided, and go away contented. It is no use arguing with the Dyak that he can see for himself that his offering is eaten up by fowls, or pigs, or boys, who are full of mischief, and have no fear of spirits. The Dyak says the spirits eat the soul or spirit of the food; what is left on the altar is only its outer husk, not its true essence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ritual333,Elegy-Weeping,"The elegy-weeping. The coldness and insensitivity with which these natives of the Uaupés see any member of the family waste away, even if it is their own father, mother, or child, is striking. The sick one is found in a hammock hung in a darker corner, and a few meters away the occupants of the maloca or house laugh, talk, eat, amuse themselves, as if no sick person was there.

Nevertheless, as soon as they notice that he has died -- (perhaps the catastrophe already happened some time ago, and they did not notice it; or there has been a mistake, he has not died yet) -- the men and women present start the elegy-weeping, uxtisé. The men utter cries and imprecations against those who caused the death; because every death, so they think, is a true murder perpetrated by some enemy by means of a malefice. The women too, appropriately called uxt ĩ ra (Uaupés uxt ĩ na ), mourners, between exclamations and with very sentimental thoughts, do the eulogy of the dead and imprecate against the pajés or persons who cast the spell, the alleged causa mortis . They lower their heads, draw the hair over the face, the tears come in abundance, and they constantly collect them with the index finger of the right hand and shake them to the ground. And they proceed in this way for a long time, in a characteristic intonation, in which they go from the lowest notes to the shrillest ones. And the mourners succeed one another in turn in this panegyric-imprecatory weeping. The last notes of their wailing have hardly been lost in the air and their last tears filtered into the floor of the maloca before the shadows of emotion clear away from their faces, and the mourner will go on to talk gaily with her companions, with her habitual good humor and noisy laughter.

The mother or wife, during the wailing, will be squatting or seated on the little seats beside the deceased, and with the right hand drawing lines on the ground. At other times they rub the hands on the cadaver and then stretch the arms in the direction of space, as if they were casting there the curses or the malefice that took the life of the deceased.

At times three or more women gather in a closed circle, in which their heads touch, and the principal mourner extends her arms, as if to embrace them all by the nape of the neck; it is what is called [unavailable]e ’e- kea-uxtisé , weeping embraced. The first mourner then starts to do the eulogy of the dead one, as if directing a dialogue with the others, who repeat her final words; or they address interlocutions, all of it intermixed with sobs and cries.

Once the panegyric-weeping is performed, which may last minutes or whole hours, calm is restored, as if nothing abnormal had happened. They resume their jobs, meal, or conversations with the habitual typical laughter.

If by chance it was during the night that the death took place, they customarily, after the weeping, stay up during the night, but talking gaily and drinking chibé, without concerning themselves about the dead one any longer.

The relatives, as they arrive to visit the family, casually or because they have learned of the death, have the same relief of noisy and laudatory wailing. On the occasion of the burial they reinitiate the weeping . When some relative who lives farther away, even if it is months later, meets the widower or widow for the first time after the death of the spouse, he places his hands on the shoulder and not infrequently the scene of the wailing is renewed.

The simple news of some death is also apt to provoke the official wailing. It is to be noted that, although the dead person might be from the husband’s tribe, many times the latter will not show any sign of grief, will calmly continue his gay chatting, leaving to his wife (who is from another tribe) the duty of wailing for the dead.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Ritual334,Girls Initiation and Defloration,"Course of female initiation — Möyöãsé

In a similar way the girl, “when she becomes a young woman,” according to the native expression, that is, when she reaches the age of the menses and the first menstruation, a mõsé , comes, must go through the puberty initiation rite.

Naturally one can not mark the date for this beforehand. It is likewise understandable that it is practically impossible to perform this rite with an entire group, as in the male initiation, if we consider that they are small povoades or only a maloca.

The first menstruation is a dangerous event for the young woman; she may be a victim of Bisíu (VII -- 4, d (5 c) ), Bisíu a’mõsé-re baásam ĩ, they say, that is, Bisíu eats the menstruation. As they explain, to eat means that he will come to fecundate her. (See Lendas do Uaupés /Legends of the Uaupés/.) The maiden then will be the first to announce the fact and to request the intervention of the pajé or Komũ.

Besides, the rite is desired by the girl, not only because it gives her freedom for the public sexual relations, but also because, according to her convictions, this rite is going to assure her happy deliveries, as various young women testified. For this reason no maiden would dare to marry without the puberty rite and the m[unknown]o-yoãsé (coitus of initiation). Some nubile maiden, especially those educated in the schools, might perhaps say, out of shyness, that she has not performed the rite. Nevertheless, she herself will affirm, in agreement with the others, that a woman can not marry without having submitted to these practices.

Patrícia Vasconcelos gave the following explanation of the necessity for the rite, according to the instruction obtained from her uncle Marco from S. Luzia, river Papuri. “The maiden has the nih ĩ- koró (vagina?) inverted, and for this reason the child cannot come out. /The final quotation marks are missing./ The pajé or Ko-m ũ is going to put it “in the proper position” by means of the rite and the coitus. The rite, besides this, makes “the nih ĩ- su’ti-ro , uterus, not grow very much, because in this case she would have two children at a time and this is a disgrace for the woman.”

This rite is essentially equivalent to the “religious defloration” that other human groups practice. However, due to the previous liberties, although without an official character (rather they must be hidden), which take place even between children and adults, the girl, upon reaching menstruation, already has the hymen ruptured. This, then, is of no importance in the rite. An official coitus, mõ-yoãsé , however, takes place on the first day (and in some povoados also on the following days) with a young man chosen by the girl or by her father, and, on the last day of the rite, with the Komũ or pajé.

The concept that the one chosen should be the hero of the group, recognized after a fight with others, as is done among some tribes, has declined. Among the Uaupesinos there is no test to determine the choice; there is only one quality in favor of the chosen one, his youth. Some maidens affirmed that he was a “strong young man.” On the rivers visited by the civilized, the latter may be chosen for such a function, and they have done it. For such a choice, we think that not only does the native’s instinct of self-interest enter in, but also the white is supposed to have a special nature, a connection with which might bring benefits for the girl. This opinion was expressed by several young women.

The girl must then be separated from the inhabitants of the maloca. The maidens do not know (and this seems to us the most probable hypothesis) or did not want to give the reason for this segregation. It is that in these circumstances she is considered dangerous, for the others, once she has been sought by Bisíu .

In the regime of the maloca, an enclosure for the young woman, called a’mõ tuxkũ , is made inside of it. In the regime of the povoado, she might perhaps be isolated inside a hut. During this time, which runs from three days to four weeks, according to the tribe, the young girl will always be shut in, she cannot take a bath, she will go out only when necessary and quickly, trying not to meet anyone.

There, while the girl is kept seated on a stool, her hair will be cut by a woman who is called mõ-paxkoá , that is, godmother of initiation. “It is in order to exchange for new hair” was the only explanation. According to information obtained by Koch G. ( Z . I . 357), the girl’s hair was used for making the masks of Wãx-tĩ. Thus one more element of connection between the puberty rite and the cult of Wãx-tĩ appears.

The face and especially the body are liberally painted with black dyá-wé dye by another woman, who is likewise considered Paxkoá . Both of the godmothers will receive some gift from the girl and also have a right to her services. The body painting is done as usual, by means of the molongó cylinder (VII-3, b(2)).

For the haircut they used the sharp teeth of the piranha ( Serrasalmo of different species) and other animals. For this reason, wrote Stradelli, the tribes of the Rio Negro, who spoke Nheengatú, when the use of scissors was introduced, called them Piranha . The artifact for the cutting of the hair among the Tukano is called Döxpóse:ró .

The Mõ-paxkoá or the mother herself in some tribes pours water with pepper through her nose, using a funnel of the leaf of 443 õhoá p ũ r ĩ or yõxsõ-p ũri, “in order to become illuminated”, “the fat to go from the face, and to remain always young.”

When the cutting of the hair and the painting of the face have been done, no person may enter the place of seclusion except the pajé or Ko-m [unknown]u, the young man, and the girl’s mother (and, lacking the latter, the grandmother or woman on whom the young woman depends), and the Mõ-paxkoá herself. She will fast a great deal; the only foods permitted are beijú, small fish (jacundá, pirámirim), ant, mexkã (manivara /termite queen/), and sirákaro (beijú of tapioca). She uses the manivara (explained Patricia Vasconcelos) “because it does not have fat and the pajé has broken its stinger.”

She will, moreover, be subjected to painful tests: she will spend long hours seated on the floor and all of the last night in vigil. The pajé or the Ko-m ũ, bending over the fire, covers her with a strainer, and he will “blow” over her, while she remains seated, with her head bowed upon her crossed arms.

During this ceremony he brings her a cuia with pepper and gives it to her to smell, “in order for the face to remain always smooth,” that is, not to be left early with a wrinkled face. Simultaneously he instructs her concerning the duties of a wife and mother.

Some of these instructions by the pajé, as the informants related to us, are: “to have good behavior toward her own mother -- to work hard -- not to do as the others do (?) -- when young to work harder -- to be kind toward the elders, to stay away from the piraboto /bouto/ -- to avoid the great snake because it swallows (that is, fecundates) the woman -- she must prepare food for the man -- work in the clearing -- not to get much sun, because otherwise she will quickly grow old -- to work rapidly -- to return home at once”.

Nevertheless, he will not tell her anything about the origin of the tribe. After having blown over her with the smoke of his cigar, pronouncing at the same time a long and unintelligible exorcism, the copulation takes place.

The rite ends with a bath of the dawn, Wáwa-’kãsé , which makes us think of the bath of the dawn of the men at the feast of Wãx-t ĩ (VII-4, e (2 b); cf. Legend of the seizure of the m ĩ r ĩ á instruments). A procession of these women who have been associated with the rite, perhaps also other close relatives of the maiden, is organized. In front goes the pajé, smoking the path with a piece of cooking pot, Ki-pu-tö koró , with hot coals, pitch /Port. breu , a kind of resin/, and pepper, and he will exorcise the river, throwing in it the contents of the pot, in order to “chase away the beast that is in the river”. The mother pushes the daughter into the water, and everyone will take a bath.

In some Arwake tribes a caxiri is held later; it is the feast called Karyamã, which may last as long as four days (it seems that it is the same number of days as the seclusion of the girl). Then she will dance with everyone, including the pajé, and will smoke with them on the cigar made of banana leaves and tobacco. It seems that on this occasion there are games and entertainments among the young individuals of the maloca.

Abstention from work for some days is verified; for example, she will not light the fire, “in order not to be burned.” Then the young woman resumes her normal life; she will work in the clearing and in the house with her mother. For another month, according to information by Dorotéia Brito, she may not taste salt or eat either piraíba or the flesh of large animals, “in order not to ruin the teeth”.

During the following menstruation the rite of the seclusion of the young woman is renewed. This second stage of the puberty initiation is called Mahã-m ĩ- nõsé . It is identical to the first one, without the cutting of the hair, however. At the following menstruation, M [unknown] h e ka-n ĩ sé , the practices of the puberty initiation are done again. This time, however, there is no segregation of the young woman, and all the acts take place with more solemnity, in view of everybody.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Ritual335,Fruit House Ritual,"In the Pirá-paraná region, the most frequently held communal dance or ritual involves bringing large quantities of wild or cultivated tree-fruit ( He rika ) into the house to the sound of the He instruments. Some authors have tried to link such rites with particular species of fruit. Although there are preferences for some fruits over others, in the Pirá-paraná area any edible tree-fruit that can be gathered in sufficient quantity may be used, and generally two or three species will be gathered for a particular rite. One of these species will predominate and will lend its name to the occasion, so that Indians might say, ‘They are bringing in mirití (or umari, or ingá, etc.) at Manuele’s today.’

The Barasana say that each household should greet the ripening of each important fruit with Fruit House. In practice, the number of these rites that each house puts on depends on many factors, such as the number of inhabitants, their sex ratio, the amount of manioc available for beer-making, the ambitions of the male inhabitants, etc., all of which are interdependent. The large and relatively prestigious Barasana house in which we worked held twelve communal rituals over a twenty-month period between March 1969 and November 1970. Of these, seven were Fruit House, one was He House, the main initiation rite, three were social dances, including the dance following initiation, and one was a ceremonial exchange of food. In addition to this, the household attended a large number of other rituals in neighbouring houses.

The decision to hold Fruit House, as with any other dance, may be taken by any adult man of the house; this man then becomes the chief host. He discusses his decision with the other men as they sit together at night, smoking and chewing coca. If there is a shaman in the house, he will be asked to officiate at the dance, otherwise a guest from another house must be asked to do this. Also, a lead dancer must be appointed, again either from amongst the men of the house or from their neighbours and guests. Sometimes the host himself will act as either shaman or lead dancer. The chief host is also responsible for seeing that enough manioc beer is provided. Normally his wife will use her own manioc for the beer though this is often supplemented with that belonging to the other women of the house. Sometimes manioc must be brought in from other houses. The chief host will ask his wife (or an unmarried sister) to prepare the beer for him, and she will in turn ask other women to help her.

A man’s social standing, and that of his maloca community, are intimately linked with the scale and number of dances that he hosts. A man without either a wife or unmarried sister will be severely handicapped in this respect as it is difficult for him to persuade other women to prepare beer for him. Similarly, a man with a lazy or inefficient wife is also handicapped as she is unlikely to have sufficient manioc to make large amounts of beer. The men of highest social standing generally live in large, spacious houses and have hard-working and efficient wives who cultivate large amounts of manioc; such women acquire considerable prestige in their own right.

Table 1 shows the participation, by household, at the nine Fruit House rituals and the single He House ritual that I observed. Each rite was held either in Mandu’s house, or in a neighbouring house at which members of Mandu’s house were present as guests (see map 3). This table represents a large proportion of those rites in which members of Mandu’s household were involved (over a two-year period). The names along the top of the table refer to the head-men of the households involved; the dates are those on which the rites were held. The average number of men present at these rites was twenty-one; the unusually large number of people attending the ritual on 29 March 1970 can in part be explained by the fact that it was held in a maloca close to the Catholic Mission, from which people either working or visiting were invited.

It can be seen from the table that there are always guests at these rites and furthermore that these guests may be of the same sib as the hosts, or of a different sib within the same exogamous group, or members of sibs of one or more different exogamous groups. Invitations to these rites go out to a household as a unit and on really grand occasions people from all the categories mentioned above will attend. Even at very limited affairs, because households are invited as units, there are generally present representatives of yet more households who have been staying in the houses of the guests.

By relating the spatial distribution of the households (see map 3) to the table showing attendance, it can be seen that, in general, the participants in these rituals are people who live close to one another in neighbouring houses (up to about one day’s travel apart). Households within this distance do a considerable amount of mutual visiting and usually invite each other to dances on a reciprocal basis. Thus, throughout the region, there are a series of overlapping ‘social spheres’, each one containing houses of both the same and of different exogamous groups and it is within these ‘spheres’ that most intermarriage takes place. The households of Mandu, Pedro, Christo and Arturo form the core of one such sphere and this is reflected in table 1. However, it must be emphasised that geographical propinquity is not the only basis on which these spheres are formed: the current state of relations between individuals, especially between men of consequence, is another important factor and one which often partially explains the location of different houses. Although Ignacio’s house is close to that of both Pedro and Mandu, relations between these households and that of Ignacio are strained and social contact is limited. Again, this is reflected in table 1. The attendance of people from Caño Tatú (Mario’s, Domingo’s and Ugo’s households) at a ritual held at Pacho’s house but not at any held in houses on upper Caño Colorado, reflects the fact that while they are within the social sphere of Pacho’s household, they are outside those of the inhabitants of upper Canõ Colorado. Hernando’s household from Caño Komeyaká came on a special visit to Mandu’s house as part of an exchange of ritual property; normally there is no regular social contact between these houses. When guests come from a long way away it is generally part of an attempt to form new social alliances or to revitalise old ones. The social spheres are fixed neither geographically, for people may move house, nor socially, for political relations keep changing. The attendance at He House is discussed in chapter 4.

Invitations are sent out between one and two weeks in advance. The chief host and/or one or more people delegated by him travel to the different houses where they deliver the invitation to the headmen, first in the form of a ceremonial dialogue and then in ordinary speech. He counts off the days on his fingers until he gets to the day on which manioc is put down ( ki rohorir[unknown]m[unknown] ), i.e. brough into the house. This is followed by the day of making beer ( idire moarir[unknown]m[unknown] ), which is followed by the day of the small dance ( basa m[unknown]tar[unknown]m[unknown] ). In the case of Fruit House this is the day the He are brought into the house (see below). Having delivered the invitation he usually departs soon afterwards, sometimes asking the people of the house to convey the invitation to other more distant houses.

However, not all Fruit House rites take this form: sometimes a man, X, of one household will decide to give fruit to another man, Y, of another household. X may either take fruit to Y’s house, in which case Y will be both recipient and chief host (who must provide beer and send out invitations) or he may invite Y to receive fruit in his own house, in which case X will be the host and donor and Y the recipient. But by no means all Fruit House rites take the form of an exchange of fruit between individuals of different households; very often both hosts and guests provide fruit without any exchange element. These details are naturally made clear in the invitations.

On the day on which manioc is put down, the women get up large quantities of manioc and other roots and the men, especially the host, often help them to carry the heavy baskets of manioc back to the house. The chief host acts as the director of the proceedings, asking, not ordering, the other men of the house to help him. He takes the men out to pick large quantities of coca, from his own coca bushes if possible, which they then process. Generally, the host and owner of the coca does the toasting of the leaves. The women spend the rest of the day grating manioc and preparing the other roots used to make beer.

On the day of making beer the men go out early in the morning, led by the host, to get firewood from the manioc gardens. They return with huge logs on their shoulders and there is an atmosphere of cooperative, friendly rivalry reminiscent of the log races of Central Brazilian Indians. The wood is split and the men then pick and process more coca while the women continue to prepare beer. During the day fruit is gathered from the forest, generally by the younger men and initiated boys; sometimes a pair of He trumpets is taken on these expeditions and played in the forest. The fruit trees are felled with axes and the fruit placed in palm-leaf baskets which are then left near the house, usually on the path leading up from the port. Cultivated fruit may also be gathered from the gardens in which case the trees are not felled.

After dusk the young men bring the He up from the river to the front of the house where they are played until after midnight (see table 2). Inside the house, the men process coca and the women continue to prepare manioc beer. Once the coca has all been processed, the men assemble in the middle of the house where, after eating the new coca, they are led in chanting by the chief host. Later on, he leads another chant session, again involving all the men.

Throughout the evening the shaman (or shamans) sits by post 1 (see figure 2 for this and all subsequent references to precise locations in the house), blowing spells into cigars and into gourds containing tobacco snuff, coca, beer and lumps of beeswax mixed with coca. When the blowing is completed, one gourd of coca and wax is placed on a stand in the middle of the house and all the men come to eat small pinches from it. One of the hosts then takes the lumps of wax from the gourd and, putting them on burning embers in a potsherd, he carries them twice round the dance path in a clockwise direction, fanning the embers to produce aromatic smoke as he goes. The wax is afterwards left smoking in the men’s doorway. Sometime later the women are also invited to eat small pinches of the blown coca.

Later on one of the hosts blows large quantities of tobacco snuff, blown over by the shamans, up the noses of the men, using a long bone tube. The snuff is then offered to the women who eat small pinches. After midnight the He are taken back to the river by the young men who play them till dawn. At the same time, they bathe in the river, thumping the water with their hands and vomiting, having drunk water mixed with the sap from the rind of a forest vine called foam vine ( somo misi ). The elder men sleep while the women finish making the manioc beer. In spite of the air of increased excitement and formality characteristic of these occasions, there is no marked separation between the sexes and the women show no apparent interest in the He being blown outside. If there are visitors present, the men sit in a group near the front door while their hosts sit in the middle of the house near the light-post. The visiting women help their hosts prepare beer.

Soon after first light, when the beer is all made, the women sweep the house clean and sprinkle water on the floor. A thick screen of woven palm leaves is moved across the house beyond posts 7 and 8, completely shutting off the rear end. Women, children and pets are then confined in this screened-off area whilst the He are played into the house. Later on the women may leave the house to go to the gardens.

The men bathe and prepare the instruments at the river and then walk back to the house playing as they come. They walk in pairs, usually with the trumpets in the lead, with short flutes and then long flutes behind them. The He players carry small bunches of fruits on their shoulders and more men walk behind carrying baskets loaded with fruit (see plate 2). The procession enters the door, goes twice (clockwise) round the dance path and then up the middle of the house to the screen where the baskets of fruit are deposited alongside other baskets already there. Generally, several different kinds of fruit are brought in. As the fruit is brought in there are shouts of ‘hoo hoo hoo hoo’ and much joking, often of a sexual nature and referring to mythical characters connected with forest fruits. 4 After this the trumpets and short flutes are played back and forth round the dance path while the long flutes are played up and down the middle of the house. For the rest of the day the instruments are played in this manner, always with the long flutes in the middle and the trumpets and short flutes round the edge (see appendix 3 for a detailed description of the movements associated with the playing of He ). In general, the long flutes are played by the older men, the trumpets by the younger men and the short flutes by the youngest boys present.

During the morning the men paint themselves with black paint called we, made from the macerated leaves of a cultivated shrub of unidentified species. The rather crude designs, mostly on the upper and lower legs, are in marked contrast to the fine patterns applied during social dances ( basaria wi ) and dances at which food is ceremonially given away ( bare ekaria wi ). The men also paint their faces with red paint called ng[unknown]nanya (caraiuru, an extract from the leaves of a cultivated vine, Bignonia chica ). All morning the shaman(s) sits, either by post 1 or post 7 next to the baskets of fruit, blowing spells into gourds containing various substances which are consumed during the rite. He blows over beer which is then drunk off the ends of sticks from a gourd placed in the middle of the house, before being consumed from gourds in the usual way. He also blows over yagé ( Banisteriopsis ) bark which is afterwards added to the rest of the bark being pounded in preparation of the drink. He blows over coca, over a large ceremonial cigar and over a gourd of snuff from which the men eat small pinches when it is placed in the middle of the house. Before the shaman blows over each of these substances, one of the host elders does a short chant with him.

In the late morning all the men assemble in the middle of the house between posts 1 and 2, sitting on ritual stools, and the senior host elder leads them all in chanting. During this chanting the coca and ritual cigar, blown over by the shaman, are handed round. At the same time yagé is served to all by the shaman. Following this the He are played again. By this stage the long flutes will have been decorated with a ruff of yellow and brown Oropendola ( japú, Icteridae sp.) feathers tied round the lower ends and the engraved designs on them will have been filled with white manioc starch or chalk which stands out against the black palm wood (see fig. 8). Shortly after the end of the chanting, the elders playing the long flutes chant briefly with the shaman and then they, together with the other elders, go to the baskets of fruit at the screen. Then, as the long flutes are played up and down the middle of the house, the elders and shaman tip the fruit out on to flat basketwork trays, throwing the empty baskets over the screen into the rear of the house. This is done with shouts of ‘hoo hoo hoo’ and with exchanges of ritualised joking. Once the fruit has been tipped into the trays, the trumpets are periodically played with their ends circling directly over the fruit, wafting it with their breath.

The tipping out of the fruit marks a distinct phase in the rite; up to this point the long flutes are played only sporadically by men wearing few or no ornaments. After this, the long flutes are played in relay more or less continuously by pairs of elders wearing diadem-like crowns on their heads. These crowns, made from woven palm leaf, have bright yellow Oropendola feathers radiating outwards like the rays of the sun, and with a single red macaw tail feather in the centre (see plate 3). They also wear monkey-fur bracelets on their right elbows and belts of jaguar or peccary teeth round their waists. As each pair starts and ends a session of playing they chant with the shaman. Their style of playing also changes: whereas before the players merely walked up and down, they now do a slow walking dance with rapid turns at each end (see appendix 3) and their playing becomes more refined and melodious. Overall, the rite becomes more formal and the focus of attention is fixed upon the men playing the flutes. It is to these men that most yagé is given, as it is to the main dancers during other dances. At the same time as this change in atmosphere, the shaman begins to blow spells over a gourd of coca mixed with lumps of beeswax.

The formal playing of the long flutes continues throughout the afternoon with three or four changes of players who each time salute the other men as they go out to play. The trumpets too are played continuously, every so often being blown over the piles of fruit. By mid-afternoon the playing of the long flutes reaches a climax: as they get to either end of the house, the players raise the ends of the flutes high in the air and then, playing ‘toooo toooo toooo toooo too too to to ttt’ on a descending scale, they run down the middle of the house with a short-stepped crouching run, accentuating the step of the right foot (see appendix 3). This action, called encouraging the fruit, having the fruit ( He rika yohag[unknown] He rika k[unknown]tig[unknown] ), evokes cries of ‘hoo, hoo, hoo’ and ritual jokes from the audience. When the shaman finishes blowing over the wax-coca mixture, it is handed to an elder who places the gourd on a stand in the middle of the space between posts 1, 2, 3 and 4. He then calls out, ‘Come and eat the blown stuff.’ Everyone present, except the shamans and the long-flute players, comes and eats a small pinch of coca. Then they all line up clutching thin wooden staves in their hands like spears and run up and down the edges of the house in a crouching position making aggressive, grumbling noises. At each end of the house they spring into the air with loud cries of ‘This is how I will kill you; now I fear nothing; I will kill you; he killed my father by sorcery; I will kill him,’ etc. This action, called acting-out spearing ( besu[unknown] kesose), is done with greatest enthusiasm by the younger men.

Immediately after this, one of the elders burns lumps of beeswax in a potsherd, walking twice round the house clockwise, up the middle to the fruit and then back down the house to the front door where he leaves the smoking wax. As he does this he is followed round by young men playing trumpets with the short flutes following behind. From then on till dusk the He are played continuously. At dusk, the feather ornaments used in dancing are prepared and the main dancer and his partner put on the full complement of ritual ornaments (see plate 4). On very formal occasions, the dancing may start before the women enter the house; usually it starts afterwards. At dusk, the short flutes and trumpets are played twice clockwise round the dance path and then down the middle of the house and out on to the plaza. At the same time the long flutes are played with increased tempo and with the players now doing a fairly brisk walk. They are then played out of the house along the same route as the trumpets. As the He are taken out, the men collect up the stools, the yagé pot and the various gourds blown over by the shaman and, taking them with them, go and sit out in front of the house on the plaza. There the shaman blows spells over bundles of panpipes and after each person has blown a short puff into the ends, they are handed round and played. At the same time, other whistles of deer bone, cane and snail-shells are played - the first time since the start of the rite.

While the men sit outside, the screen shutting off the rear of the house is removed and the women once again re-enter the main part. After they have come in, the men return from the plaza and the dance begins.

In general, visitors arrive as household units, often accompanied by the guests who have been staying with them. They travel by canoe or on foot and often the men go ahead of the women. On arrival at the house, the men stop at the port, where they bathe, paint their faces and tuck sweet-smelling herbs under their bead arm-bands and G-strings. Sometimes they also put on feather crowns and other ritual ornaments. They they walk, in single file with the most senior men at the front, up to the house. If they have brought fruit and He instruments with them they enter the house in the manner described above, after which they reassemble at the men’s door to be greeted. Otherwise they go straight to the men’s door and stand in line in order of seniority.

The greetings start with the senior guest chanting a greeting which is repeated in chorus by those with him. The chief host receives this greeting, repeating the last phrase of each line of the chant. Then the chief host greets each man, in order of seniority, addressing him by the appropriate kinship term and talking in normal speech. He is followed by all the men present in the house who stand in line in order of seniority and greet each guest individually. The men then go off and greet the visiting women, in much less formal manner, while the women of the house greet the arriving men. Finally the host women greet their female guests. The men always enter through the men’s door at the front of the house and usually the women come in through the women’s door at the back.

Once the greetings are over, the visiting men are given beer to drink and then they move as a group and sit to one side of the men’s door. The most senior men sit on stools which they either bring with them or which the hosts bring to them; the rest sit on long, low benches placed on either side of the door along the front walls of the house. There they are led in chanting (called ehakoadiaha mani - we have arrived) by a member of their own group. After a short interval, the chief host comes and sits in front of them and after an exchange of coca and cigars, he leads them in another chant, telling them to rest ( [unknown][unknown][unknown]hea rotig[unknown] ). Once this is over, the guests begin to take part in the proceedings, though initially they tend to behave as a discrete unit. As time passes, the divisions between guests and hosts and between the different arrival groups become less and less marked.

Guests always arrive before the He are taken out of the house and usually before the burning of beeswax (see above). If they are bringing large amounts of fruit to present to their hosts they will arrive either early in the morning before the tipping out of the fruit (see above) or more usually on the evening of the start of the rite. When they arrive at this time, the greetings tend to be less formal and the fruit which they bring is left at the port, together with their He .",0,1,0,1,1,1
Ritual336,Dance at the Fruit House,"The Dance

The overall pattern of the dance, consisting of a series of dance sets interspersed with sessions of chanting, is set out in table 2. What follows is a short account of the dance taken as an event through time.

Before going out to dance, the lead dancer does a short chant ordering the dance ( basa rotig[unknown] ), with the officiating shaman and the other elders. He then starts to dance back and forth between posts 1, 2, 3 and 4 and is gradually joined by other dancers. Each man dances with his left hand on the right shoulder of the one next to him so that a long line, facing in towards the centre of the house, is formed. In their right hands the dancers carry rattles or wooden staves, depending on the particular dance being performed. The dance line then moves off round and round the dance path, oscillating back and forth. As the dancing starts, the women partake of a communal meal in the centre of the house. Soon after they are offered the gourds containing snuff and wax-coca mixture from which the men ate whilst the He were still inside the house.

The dancing as a whole is divided into a number of sets interspersed with periods of chanting. One named dance is danced and sung throughout the entire night, but the words change for each set though they centre on a common theme, Each dance set is in turn divided into a seemingly variable number of sequences with periods of rest, drinking and talking in between. The final sequence of each set, called ending, breaking the dance ( basa tadi yig[unknown] ) is marked by a change in tempo and by different movements, both of the dance line as a whole and of the steps employed. At the start of the dance, the main dancers represent a more or less clearly defined group of people who are essentially members of one particular household. In some cases it is the hosts who dance, in others the dancers comprise members of one or more visiting households who arrive in a discrete group; in yet other cases, one visiting group may dance together with the hosts while another plays an essentially passive role. There is no clear correlation between the role of dancers and the role of providers of fruit: sometimes it is the hosts who provide the bulk of the fruit and who dance in their own house; sometimes the hosts provide the fruit while the guests dance and sometimes it is the guests who both dance and provide the fruit. This is in marked contrast to dances at which the food is ceremonially presented by one or more households to another, at which, whether the dance is held in the house of the donors or the recipients, it is always the donors who do the main dancing.

The main dancers are distinguished from the rest by wearing the total complement of feathers, teeth belts, bark-cloth aprons, etc., which make up their dress (see plate 4); the others wear small woven palm-leaf crowns decorated with feathers like the rays of the sun (see plate 3). In Barasana categories the dancers wear maha hoa, while the rest wear buya b[unknown]k[unknown] bedo . When not dancing, the dancers sit on a row of stools between posts 1 and 2, facing into the middle of the house. The others sit in two groups, roughly defined by household or arrival group, along the front wall of the house on either side of the male door; those on the left are generally more distant and somewhat less active in the dance. As the dance progresses throughout the night, more and more people join in the main dancing and the discrete seating groups become intermingled so that by morning they are no longer easily discernible.

While the main dancers dance and chant, the other men sit talking and laughing and playing panpipes. Periodically groups of them, especially the younger men, go out into the middle of the house and dance with their panpipes. These dances are relaxed, individualistic and with an erotic and exciting air which contrasts with the more sacred and formal atmosphere of the main dance. As the night wears on, the main dancers take a more active part in these panpipe dances which reach a climax in the morning and often continue long after the formal dance is ended. On more formal occasions when there are large numbers (forty plus) of people present, those not involved in the main dance may form up into a separate dancing unit. They dance a special category of dances called hia basa using very small rattles and holding thin peeled wands high in their right hands. The overall form of these dances is similar to the main dance but the dancing starts and ends outside the house on the plaza. The tempo of these dances is also faster than that of the main dance.

The women sit, apart from the men, in small groups along the sides of the dance path and in the rear end of the house. After each dancing session has started, they come up behind the dance line and, tucking their heads and shoulders under the men’s arms and holding on to their waists, they join in. They must leave the line again before the end of each session, their exit being signalled by a slight change in rhythm from the rattles or staves. When dancing in the formal dances, a woman must dance each time with the same man and enter through the same ‘slot’. In panpipe dancing, the men start to dance alone and the women then come out and choose their partners. There is often an air of friendly rivalry in these dances with the young men of one household trying to outdo those of another. Often there are three or more groups dancing at the same time, each playing a different melody against the rest.

The main chanting sessions (see table 2) are held between posts 1 and 2 and essentially involve the main dance line. One man, a specialist chanter, and often also the lead dancer, leads the chanting while the rest, seated in an oval round him, repeat each phrase in chorus. Each session is preceded by a long period during which each man receives coca, cigars and snuff from every other, starting with the chanter who hands round coca and snuff and a cigar, all of which have had spells blown over them by the shaman. Each session of chanting is named and the verbal content of each is different The two longest and most important sessions, giving coca ( kahi ejag[unknown] ) and pouring out beer ( idire iog[unknown] ) are held around midnight and dawn respectively. The former chant refers largely to the mythical origins of the various varieties of coca and how these were obtained from the group’s ancestors, whilst the latter refers to the origins of beer and the manioc used to make it. During these chant sessions yagé is served by the shaman. Once the dancer/chanters have been served the rest of the people are given yagé, but it is always the former who receive most. Yagé is also served to the dancers during the pauses between sequences of dancing. At big dances with many visitors present, there are many subsidiary chant sessions involving the visiting households as discrete units, sometimes led in chanting by their hosts and sometimes by their own headmen or chanters. The He, which remain outside the house until first light, are played occasionally throughout the night. They are always played during the chant session ‘giving coca’. At first light they are taken back to the river and hidden.

Throughout the whole dance, the officiating shaman remains more or less permanently seated by post 1, except when serving yagé or chanting with the dancers. He does not dance with the main dance line but may occasionally take part in panpipe dancing. He wears a palm-leaf crown often topped by dollops of white duck down. Most of his time is spent blowing spells on to various substances which are later distributed to the assembled company. Very often red paint is blown and each man and woman then wipes it on the  legs as a protection against snake bite. At the end of the dance, after the chanting called ending the dance ( basa gahanong[unknown] ), the shaman removes the feather head-dresses from the head of each dancer, starting with the leader, and then wipes away the harmful effects of wearing feathers with his hands, ending each wipe with a flick and clap accompanied by loud blowings. 13 This marks the end of the dance proper, though panpipe dancing and beer drinking usually continue until nightfall.

Most of the chants are based around the journeys of the first ancestors, the He people, from their place of origin in the east to the areas in which their descendants now live. The chants list off the named geographical locations where the first people stopped on their journeys, describing how they danced and obtained various cultural items, especially those used in ritual. Barasana myths, like many of their Australian aborigine counterparts, are precisely located in topographical space. For the sake of brevity, I have left out the geographical referents of the various incidents related in the myths. In practice, each incident is tied to a precise, named location, and each time a character passes from one place to another, all the places through which he travels are listed in detail. This geographical framework forms the major articulation between myths and chants.
During the chants, the specialist chanter, under the influence of yagé, is able to make his soul leave his body so that it repeats the mythical journeys of the first ancestors. He starts at Manao Lake ( Manao [unknown]tarã ), identified with present-day Manaus in Brazil, and lists off all the named locations between there and the Pirá-paraná. The time sequence of this journey corresponds, in part, to the sequence of the ritual so that, by the end, the chanter will have ‘arrived’ back in the Pirá-paraná region, and, at different times during the rites, informants will say, ‘Now he has got to such and such a place.’
Without first knowing well the myths that underlie them, it would be impossible to fully understand the chants. During my fieldwork, I concentrated on knowing the myths. I hope, in the future, to return and to work on the chants.

In cases where the hosts are the main providers of fruit of a kind that can be eaten without further elaboration, there is very often an informal distribution of fruit immediately following the dance. (This distribution may also take place just before the start of the dance when the sacred horns are removed from the house.) The recipients, who are called up by name to receive the fruit from the senior host, are generally those of a visiting household group who did not provide any of the fruit at the start of the rite. If the fruit requires further processing (cooking, maceration in water, etc.) it is given to the host women who make it up into food or drink which is later distributed to all present in the form of a communal meal.

Shortly after the end of the dance, all the men go down to the river to bathe and vomit, having previously wiped snuff, blown by the shaman, on their knees and legs to prevent aches and pains caused by contact with water after dancing and wearing feathers. On their return, the men are each given a small quantity of cassava bread and meka (large ground-living termites), blown over by the shaman, to eat. This is followed by a meal of the same. Soon after, fruit, smoked chilli pepper, salt and small fish called fish children ( wai rĩa ), cooked with manioc leaves or ‘spinach’ ( au, Phytolacca iconsandra ), are all blown over by the shaman and distributed to each man, after which a communal meal, of fish and ‘spinach’, is held. On the following day the shaman blows spells over various species of larger fish (the category big fish, wai hakarã ), over meat ( wai b[unknown]k[unknown]rã, meaning literally old mature fish) and over raw chilli pepper; and in the days that follow, other categories of food will be blown as and when they are available, each time preceding a meal.

On the day following the end of the dance it is customary for the host men to take their guests to pick coca and then to process it so that, when they leave the next day, their coca pots will be full. It is during this coca picking that some of the host men are sent to the forest to catch certain categories of fish and game so that they can be blown over by the shaman.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Ritual337,Fruit House as the First Stage of Initiation,"Fruit House as the First Stage of Initiation

For the Barasana and their neighbours, male initiation is a long-drawn-out affair. For a young boy, the process starts around the age of eight years and continues often until he has reached the age of fifteen. (These ages are approximate; the Barasana do not reckon age in years.) The process can be divided into two stages which correspond to Barasana categories. The first stage involves the initiates (generally between two and ten of them, hence the difference in ages of the candidates) taking part in a Fruit House rite for the first time in their lives. Between this and the next stage they will take part in a number of these rites as they are held regularly, outside the context of initiation, as each fruit comes into season. The second stage involves showing the initiates a different set of sacred musical instruments, the true He, during a longer ritual, He House, followed by a period of two months fasting and other restrictions.

Two other writers on the Vaupés region, Amorim (1926/8: 52—5) for the Wanano and Coudreau (1887: 198) for the Tariana, have reported two stages in the process of initiation; I suspect that lack of such reports from other authors on this region may reflect inadequate data and that it cannot be taken to indicate that the same pattern is not found among the other groups. Among the Tariana, the first stage, for boys between ten and twelve years old, involves fasting and seeing the Yurupary instruments. At the second stage, between thirteen and fourteen years old, the initiates are shown the sacred Yurupary masks called Macacaraua .

Among the Wanano, the first stage, for eight-year-olds, consists of a month of fasting in a special compartment followed by whipping, teaching by the elders and the showing of Yurupary. The second stage, for those ‘who have shown the ability to impregnate’ involves two months of fasting followed by the showing of the more sacred Yurupary called Mahsankero .

For the Barasana, the decision to hold the first stage of initiation rests primarily with the fathers of the boys concerned and also with the shaman(s) who live with them or are most closely related to them. The rite is usually held in the house of the father of one or more of the initiates, usually the most senior, but may also be held in the house of the officiating shaman if he lives elsewhere. One of the fathers becomes the chief host, helped by the other fathers; often boys from several houses, not necessarily of the same exogamous group, are initiated at the same time. The details of the preparations are otherwise the same as those described above for a normal Fruit House rite.

I am not entirely sure how often Fruit House as the first stage of initiation is held. Informants state that, in the past, large numbers of (up to about ten) boys were initiated at the same time. In saying this, they are generally referring to the second stage of initiation, He house. Today, the first stage appears to take place as and when there are one or more boys of the appropriate age. Neither stage of initiation is exclusive to one sib or even to one exogamous group and it often happens that boys from different groups are initiated all together in one house.

The details concerning the arrival of guests are much the same as those given above except for the fact that when boys are being initiated outside their own home, they must be brought to the house where the initiation is held before the rite begins so that they can be prepared. Apart from being rather more formal and elaborate, the ritual and the preparatory activities are essentially the same as those described above. That description is based upon observations of several different rites; here my description is based on the observation of one particular case. Reference should be made to the column headed ‘Initiates’ of table 2.

Both on the eve of the rite and during the rite itself, each time that blown snuff, coca, etc. was eaten, the young boys ate first. When blown tobacco snuff was administered through the bone tube on the eve of the rite, the boys were given such large doses that they choked and vomited and had to be forcibly restrained from running away. The other men were also given unusually large quantities of snuff. In addition to the usual round of shamanism preceding the rite, the shamans blew spells over whips made from peeled saplings with the twigs left on.

On the morning of the ritual, while the other men bathed at the river, the three boys were given a special wash outside on the plaza. The two shamans blew tobacco smoke over the heads and hands of the boys who then washed their faces and hands from a bowl of water. This was the only occasion I witnessed on which the men bathed after the fruit had been taken into the house. Once washed the boys painted their legs with black we paint, and were dressed with newly ochred garters below their knees, clean white handkerchiefs round their necks and palm-leaf crowns on their heads. They were afterwards led inside the house where they were sat down in a group on a woven palm-leaf mat placed directly on the floor to the right of the men’s door. Soon after this the senior host elder and the officiating shaman came and handed the boys the ceremonial cigar and the gourd of coca, blown over by the shaman. These were then offered round to everyone else. There was a definite sense in which the boys were being treated as honoured guests. The boys came from two neighbouring houses, one of the same sib as the hosts, the other of a junior sib within the same exogamous language group.

Before the tipping out of the fruit, the initiates were each given small pink berries of the Kana (Sabicea amazonensis) vine to eat which had previously been blown over by the shaman. They were then called up to help tip out the fruit, but apart from this and when they were playing the short flutes or taking substances blown by the shaman, they sat silent and motionless on their mat. During the rite the boys were given large quantities of yagé, each time served to them in a very ritualised and formal manner. This was the first time they had ever taken yagé. The yagé used was also much stronger than usual - a larger-than-usual amount of leaf yagé ( kahi [unknown]ko ) being used. Each time it was the initiates who were served first. Whenever the trumpets were played, the three initiates walked behind them playing the short flutes.

The main difference between this and other Fruit House rites observed by me came after the burning of the beeswax. All afternoon the shamans had flicked their whips making a loud swishing noise and once the wax had been burned this noise reached a crescendo. A young man of about twenty went out to the middle of the house near the screen where he was whipped by the two shamans. He then ran up and down the house acting-out spearing. Then the two shamans were whipped by two host elders, again followed by acting-out spearing. Finally the two elders ran twice round the dance path in an aggressive manner, down the middle of the house towards the men’s door, and then hurled the bundles of whips against the end wall with an angry shout. The younger men rushed forward and grabbed the whips which they carried with them until the end of the dance. While this went on, one of the host elders went to the rear of the house where the women and children were, and there whipped his two-year-old son gently across the legs and body. On the eve of the rite, I had been told that the young boys were to be whipped but in fact this never happened. This may have been because by the time the whipping started, one of the boys had collapsed from the effects of the yagé and the other two were suffering from extreme nausea and looked frightened and confused. Other boys who had recently undergone this rite assured me that they had been whipped.

The dance that followed was in no way different from any other that I saw except that, because whipping must always take place after dark, the dancing started later and the women were allowed back into the house much later. Informants’ descriptions of this rite correspond closely to what I observed, except that the informants state that usually a special compartment of palm leaves is constructed next to the men’s door (see fig. 2). The He are placed inside this enclosure and are not seen by the initiates until they are taken out and blown in the middle of the house at midday. The initiates are then confined in this compartment, together with the He, until the end of the dance.",0,0,0,0,1,0
